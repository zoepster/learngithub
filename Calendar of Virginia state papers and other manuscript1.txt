PREFACE. This volume, the third in the series arranged and edited by William P. Palmer, M. D., extending from January the first, 1782, to December the thir- tieth, 1784, furnishes a new phase of the condition of the people of Virginia, during the period over which it extends. The modern demand for histories of the people, in contrast with histories of rulers and governments, has revolutionized, in large degree, historical com- position, and given a value to the Virginia State Calendar, and similar works, which cannot be two highly estimated. The sacrifices made by Virginia in the conquest of liberty and the establishment of a government which are the common property of the people of the United States, (so fully recorded in these papers,) will much increase the sense of obligation to Virginia, felt by all. To the historical student interested in the original manuscripts preserved in the archives of the Commonwealth, it may be proper to state that, in the superintendence of this volume, while passing through the press and in the preparation of the index, I have had ample means of knowing that this work of Dr. Palmer is marked by unusual accuracy in transcription and judgment in annotation—so important in works of this character.

In regard to the amount of Spirits, and Salt due from the State of Vir- January 1st ginia. to the Continent—viz: "134282 galls: of the former, and "15443 Bushels of the latter." He had already on the 21st ult: urged the necessity of this supply being furnished but the Executive had not noticed his communication. He now begs for a temporary supply for the immediate use of the Southern Army, particularly of Salt, to the amount of one thousand bushels, and twenty hhds: of Rum. He has no means of transporting it. Jos: Jones, J. Madison ju: and Ed: Randolph to Gov: Harrison. January 1st "Sir A Letter from Genl: Heath who commands the Army on the North Philadelphia River, dated the 26th ult, informs Congress that an intelligent person from JSTew York had reported to. him, that an embarkation of Troops was taking place there, that he saw a part of them going on board, and a number of dragoon horses hoisted into the Vessels, that he was told by a Captain with whom he was well acquainted, that Genl: Leslie had written to Genl: Clinton, that unless he was reinforced with nine hundred men, he could not defend Charles Town, that a much larger number than that were to embark, that besides Charles Town, they were destined to Georgia and Augustine. The person did not know all the Corps that were to embark, but was informed there were to be some British, some Hessians, & the new raised Corps, of which Robinsons & the itf. York volunteers were particularly mentioned. They appeared to be bringing down much baggage to the wharves. It was said, they expected to have the whole on board by the Sunday preceding the date of the letter. Although the general plan of our Official Correspondence excludes unauthenticated intelligence, the successful enterprise of the Marquis de Builli ag'st the Island of Eustatius, is attended with so many marks 1

Richmond Begging for Clothing for the Artificers at his Laboratory—Laments the present condition of things, which requires an Order from him for the most trifling things—In consequence of this his workmen are often idle, when if he had the power to call upon the other departments for aid without first having to get authority from the Com: of War, his own department would be much more efficient—adds "whatever must be done for Forage, my Waggon and riding horses are on the eve of perishg: and no prospect that I see of relief: the State of our public affairs are in so exhausted & lamentable a situation, that I almost despond of effecting any thing either honorable to myself or salutary to the Public by any exertion that I may be able to make—The arms from York now lay on the ships at Ozborns, and when I shall be able to get them up, I have not the most distant view—I did propose the vessel that was intended for the bringing up the cannon, for that pur- pose, but she is now without hands, should embezzlements be the con- sequence of such delays, I hope I may stand acquitted of being the cause, &c— January 1st J AS: Holt, Lieut: 11th Ya.

January 2nd "Sir We were yesterday honored with your letter of the 21st ulto. and Annapolis shall give directions that the line of Posts be continued from Alexan- dria through this State—We have written to the Count de Rochambeau to this effect: and we hope his apprehensions of unnecessary delay of his dispatches will be removed—We are greatly obliged to your Excel- lency's communication respecting Joseph Shoemaker—from the infor- mation that can be obtained, we are induced to believe he originally resided in Pennsylvania, and removed from thence to Virginia, and was an Inhabitant of your State when the Depredations alluded to by you, were committed." ****** We have the Honor to be &c Lieut: Nathl: Price, sends to War Office list of five Soldiers, enlisted January 2nd for six months, and recommends the abandonment of the Post at that Prince place, there being no probability of any more soldiers being received EdHouseCt there. Col: Davies informs the Executive, that a suit for damages to the January 2nd amont of £100,000 is about to be brought by Col: Adams against Capt: War Office Anderson "of the Corps of Artificers," for cutting timber "necessary for the Shops"—The Executive agrees to submit the demand to the decision of Arbitrators— Ensign Strother Settle applying to Col: Davies for authority to order January 2nd from Capt: Young clothing and shoes for some Soldiers he has to send Fredericks- to Cumberland Old Ct. House to Col: Febiger—They are naked and burg bare-foot, and Capt Young will not issue an article without orders from the War Office &c. Col: Ed: Carrington informs the Governor of the necessity of a guard January 3rd over the Stores removed to the other side of the River, and suggests Richmond that the Chesterfield Militia be ordered at once to take charge of them, in place of the Henrico Militia just releived, in as much as "the men now on duty cannot be ordered out of their own County"—A "subaltern and fifteen men will be sufficient" and will report to Mr. Rob't Jones, Dep: Eield Com: Genl: of Military Stores, in Manchester.

January 3rd "Sir, Washington By recent intelligence from the Cherokee Country, it appears that County a kocjy Qf Indians and Tories. What may he in the power of Govern- ment to do for us, 1 am at a loss to determine: however I am strongly pressed to made application, as the danger apprehended seems great. During the time of the late negociation and Treaty with the Indians at the Great Island, a total cessation of hostilities happened, and there was professions and a seeming disposition for a lasting peace, but on our recovering the upper parts of the Southern States, a number of the vilest of the Tories sought an Asylum among the Indians: of these was a Mr. Scott who now Acts a British Agent: he having some influ- ence and by means of supplies carried in by the Tories from Savannah and East-Florida, he strengthened his Party and became in a condition to act against us. The longer he is let to rest in Safety, the more for- midable he may become, and probably will in a short time, be able to draw a part of the Creek and Chicasa Tribes into his Confederacy. Collo. Martin's scheme for to surprise Scott with a small force is a project of very doubtfull success. The distance he would have to march would be above two hundred mile's, having three large rivers to pass, the force of the enemy when collected amounts to several hundreds, and he would have the supposed friendly Tories in his rear, which might prove his worst enemies in case of a disaster. For which reasons I have recommended his giving out the attempt, until the sense of your Excellency and the Council are known—In order to do the business more effectually, I would propose that tbe enterprize be car- ried on under the immediate direction of the Executives of Virginia and North Carolina, with a force not less than five hundred good men. The Governors of each State could give orders concerning the general and most weighty matters: a Council of the Field Officers from the Coun- ties which are to furnish the men might meet, adjust and order every thing else, by virtue of powers from their respective Executives. Some money would be wanted in advance to procure canves and provisions: I think a few hundred pounds sent with secrecy, and managed with address and econemy, would revive the public credit, and the balance of the expence would readily be trusted to some future day. A supply of Ammunition and Flints would be wanted, and if to be had, fifty Dragoon Swords for each State: as the Tories with the Enemy are equipt as Cavalry— If the Expedition proves successful, a Garrison ought to be left some- where on the Tenasee, to awe and regulate the remaining part of the Cherokees, and to prevent Tories or other disorderly persons, taking up their residence amongst the Indians. The advantages that may redound to the United States, by this undertaking will be great. For besides securing tranquility to the Southern frontiers, that is from the

Our mismanagement to the Westward, and the enemies late successes on the Ohio, will no doubt, induce a general war with the Northward Tribes the ensuing Summer. I am Honourable Sir, with much esteem Your most Obet & very Humble Servf Col: Ed: Carrington to Col: Davies. 'January 3rd Calling his attention to the orders given by Genl: Washington, thro' ftichmond letter to Gov: Harrison, in regard to the necessity of keeping a suffi- cient number of boats in readiness at Westham, to remove the public Stores established at Manchester, up James River, in case of the approach of the Enemy. On his return from Roanoke, the Governor had informed him, directions had been given to the Com: of War on this head—He desires now to know how the matter stands, and takes the liberty to suggest that the number of boats should be sufficient to carry off at "one trip" all the public stores, and for this purpose at least sixty will be needed—Boats commonly used in this kind of navigation, and always kept well manned so as to avoid surprise or delay will be best. For want of buildings at Westham, the Stores have been put at Manchester, six miles from the nearest point of navigation for these boats. This, in case of Danger will require the aid of waggons—Asks what the Government can do towards furnishing this transportation. Rob't Morris to Governor of Virginia. January 3rd "Sir I enclose the Copy of a Letter written this day to the States of Office Massachusetts, Rhode Island and Maryland. It is unnecessary to say of ^inance anything on the Subject to your Excellency, as you will see and feel with me the Urgency of the occasion. It gives me great pain to make such a Representation and especially as those States deserve applause for their former Exertions— I have the Honor to be with great Respect Sir, Your Excellency's most ob't.& humb Sevt"

6 CALENDAE OF STATE PAPEES. 1782. "Sir January 3rd Altho' it is nw eleven months sine Congress recommended an Impost of five per Cent on goods imported ©n Prizes and Prize Goods, the States of Massachusetts, Ehode Island and Maryland have not yet complyed with that recommendation— I will not repeat the Arguments to induce a Compliance, which are sustained either in my letter of the twenty-seventh of July or else- where, that is unnecessary. The Object of this letter is to make a Eepresentation, which can no longer be delayed consistently with the Duties I owe, either to myself or to my Country. And altho' it is prin- cipally designed for those three States, just mentioned, yet I transmit it to the other States (in a letter of which the Copy is enclosed) because all ought to know what is equally interested to all— Convinced that the Impost recommended, was not sufficient, I had devised some additional Funds for payment of our Debts and support of our Credit—These I should have submitted to the consideration of Congress, had the States complyed with their former Eecommendations. In a Circular letter dated the nineteenth of October last, I had the Honor to mention an Order prohibiting Loan Officers from issuing Cer- tificates in payment of Interest, together with the Eeasons for which it was made. That order has already produced much clamor among Pub- lic Creditors—This I expected, and I still expect, that it will occasion much more. The Public Debt is considerable, and the Public Credit must be lost, if the Interest of it be not provided for—Congress have done their duty in requesting a Eevenue, and I have done mine in Soliciting a Compli- ance with their Eequest. It only remains for me to bear Testimony against those who oppose that compliance, and to declare that they and they only, must be responsible for the consequences—They are answer- able to the other States, to their fellow Citizens, to the Public Creditors and to the whole World— I must speak plainly on this subject. I must point out from Time to Time the Eeasons of those things which have produced murmurs and Complaints against the Representative Body of America. I must direct those who suffer to those who occasion their sufferings: and those who are injured, to those who have done them wrong. Let me then, once more intreat that this great Object be seriously considered. Let me repeat that the Hope of our. Enemy is in the Derangement of our Finances; and let me add that when Eevenue is given, that Hope must cease. He therefore who approves the Grant of such Eevenue, not only opposes himself to the Dictates of Justice, but he labors to continue the War, and of Consequence to Shed more Blood, to Produce more Devas- tation, and to extend and Prolong the miseries of Mankind—" "Addressed To the Governors of the States of Massachusetts, Ehode Island & Maryland"

He January 4th had hoped for an abundant quantity of flour and pork from Cumberland Cumberland Co. but through Mr. Wilson's entire neglect, and total incapacity for his Ct ^jj^usq position as County Commissioner, he has been disappointed—In Amelia Co. there were numbers of beef cattle "stalling" for the troops, but as soon as the people supposed the Provision Law to be repealed, they withheld their supplies—As a last resort he has again written to Mr. Pearce, who sends uncertain instructions to the County Commissioners, and altho' there is plenty of beef in Amelia, Bedford and Prince Edward Cos., it cannot be gotten except by impressment. He now writes once more to Mr. Pearce, and begs the letter may be forwarded to him, for unless Government interposes, the troops must starve. He has also been disappointed in Buckingham Co., but with the aid of Mr. Smith and Col: Booker the post can be supplyed without the assistance of Cumberland Co.. "excepting Skipwith's Mill"—He anxiously awaits the return of the Express with answer to this— John Smith Co. Lieut: to Gov: Harrison.

Co- He did not consider his authority as County Lieutenant enables him to comply with this requisition, and therefore referred the matter to Colo: Holmes in charge of the guard, who reports, he cannot furnish an escort from his Command. For these reasons, at the request of the Inhabitants of the County he writes to the Governor, adding "The great hardships which the people have suffered for some time past by the impressing law, for the maintainance of prisoners they humbly conceive entitle them to hope for their continuance at this post, now that a prospect of advan- tage appears to attend their presence—Whatever Congress may demand for their safe-keeping, whatever quantity of provisions may be demanded for their support, I am authorized to say shall be complyed with in the best and cheapest manner—a Provost shall be built & every attention paid to the usual demands. The people Sir, look up to your Excellency upon this occasion & wish thro: your means to obtain this indul- gence." ******* "I must request your Excellency to give me instructions how far I am to comply with Genl: Lincoln's demand, as I hold myself under no command of Congress; but thro' means of the sanction of your Orders"

January 5th When he left Richmond he had Orders to march Major Nelsons Corps Winchester of Cavalry to New London in Bedford Co., but on his arrival, he found them ill with inoculation and Small pox. They are now recovering and will soon be able to move, but he knows not how he is to provide for their support either at Winchester or on the march to Bedford—The people absolutely refuse to furnish food for the men or forage for the horses, since they have heard the "Impress Act" is repealed, and the Quarter Master refuses him any aid, because the Corps is a State Organ- ization and he has neither orders or money with which to procure sup- plies. If he had not continued impressing, the men and horses "must have dyed"—But the inhabitants of Winchester will no longer submit to impressment. It will be necessary to give some special Order for impressment both there, and along the march, in order to relieve him from the situation in which he finds himself: he therefore urges an early reply to this, by the returning Dragoon— January 6th LuT: COLO.

Winchester On his Arrival at this place, in accordance with instructions from the Secy: of War, he made application to the Co: Lieut: Col: Smith for a guard of Militia to conduct the prisoners to Frederick Town, Maryland, who referred the matter to Col: Holmes, who gives assurances that they should be furnished; and Col: Wood had already procured the necessary transportation for the Officers Baggage, But when all seemed ready Col: Smith would not order the guard needed. The propriety of this request will be seen by the following extract from his Orders : "After fixing the arrangements at Lancaster, York, & Frederick, you will pro- ceed on to Winchester, and then make application to the County Lieu- tenant, to whom I have likewise written, for a sufficient Guard to escort all tbe prisoners now there to Frederick Town, where you are to lodge the Germans, and march on the British, under a guard that will be furnished you hy the State of Maryland to York Town and Lancaster in the State of Pennsylvania— He conceives it his duty to say, that a "very great number of the prisoners have already escaped, and it will be impossible to prevent it in the future without some "Works": but this will be unnecessary as they are to be removed to places where contracts are already made for taking care of them; being badly supplied where they now are, having been twenty days on short rations of flour and beef—He therefore requests that some one may be invested with authority to comply with the requisition of the Secy: of War.

Armand's Corps, and asking Executive interference—Con- cludes—"Considering them a body entirely unconnected with this State, it is justly considered as an hardship to have our property taken from us, when the rest of the County is free from exactions of this kind" Col: Jo: Holmes to Col: Wm. Davies. January6th Immediately on his reaching home, he had sent out the Orders to the Winchester different Co. Lieutenants—Only the quota of men from Frederick have come in, but those from Shenandoah and Hampshire he learns are on the way to Winchester. Col: John Smith has received request to fur- nish a guard for the prisoners to Fred: Town in Maryland, but refuses to comply, having no right to order the militia out of the State, except by authority of the Governor and Council. The prisoners therefore still remain; but he adds, "the truth of the matter is thus, the inhab- itants of this place & in its Yicinity are backward in parting with the pris'rs since they find that Speeia is procured to supply them, and the State of Pennsylvania Are equally desirous of having them for the same reason—A considerable sum of money is coming from ISTew York for both Officers & Soldiers, this with the money that is to be put into the hands of the Contractors, have put the Pennsylvanians in motion. I understand the people here have Sent a Memorial to Congress, seting forth the hardships they have laboured under for two years past, in hav- ing their property taken from them without any consideration for the support of Pris'rs. And now, when there is any advantage arising from having them amongst us, they should be ordered off to another State. I have not seen what they have wrote to our Executive, but beleive that its to use their Influence with Congress to permit the Pris'rs to remain here & be furnished in the same manner as those in other States, this being done I must Confess will be of great advantage to this part of the Country. Yet as to my own private Interest, I should wish to be clear of them—" ****** "The Light Dragoons under Capt: Eead keep up the Spirit of impressment, the people are much dissatisfied with them, but no kind of supplies are laid in by the Quarter Master at this Post, therefore they might either impress or starve "— Benj: Green, A.

CALENDAR OF STATE PAPEES. 11 Edm: Randolph, J. Madison Ju: and Jos: Jones, to the Goven. of Ya. 1782. January 8th. "Sir Your Excellency's favor of the 28th ulto: not having acknowledged Philadelphia the receipt of our dispatches by Capt: Irish, we shall repeat them, unless the next post shall announce his arrival. We cannot but lament the distressing and degrading situation in which we are placed, from the scantiness and uncertainty of our supplies, in which our own private credit can avail us nothing, and prices are immoderate and ruinous. We beg the attention of the Executive to this point important to ourse]ves, and perhaps important to our Country. The inclosures* (no 1 & 2), were received from a Mr. Murray. He has painted his services to Yirginia at the Illinois, in strong terms, and his sufferings on her account in stronger. We have therefore undertaken to transmit to your Board, his State of both, requesting that some answer may be given to his application. Being disposed to advance, on every proper occasion, the views of our Ally, and to demonstrate to Great Britain how practicable it is to renounce her manufactures and produce, we rendered every aid in our -power to the resolution which the president has sent on, recommending more effectual provision against the introduction of British Merchan- dizes. As these Considerations were the grounds of the resolution, we cannot doubt that our Legislature will execute the recommendation. It will be remembered that the late ordinance respecting captures, which has been fowarded to the judges of the Court of Admiralty thro' your Excellency, relates to this species of commodities when found on water only. The Superintendant of Finance is instructed to transmit to the several States copies of the Act, incorporating the National Bank. He probably will be explicit in the benefits to be expected from such an institution. To him we will consign this part of the Subject. But some Scruples having been entertained as to the Authority of Congress to grant a Charter of incorporation, we cannot forbear to mention the predicament in which this body stood. When the establishment of a bank was proposed to Congress on the 26th day of May last, its utility was immediately seen. They accord- ingly approved the plan, and promised to support it in the most effectual manner. Among other things, they stipulated to pass an act of incorpor- ation: altho' objections were suggested against such an engagement. After a vote to this effect, subscriptions were made upon the expectation of a Charter from Congress, the president and directors chosen, and we were required to fulfil our Contract. The same doubts upon Congres- sional power were again urged; but nothing decisive was done, until a committee appointed to confer with the bank, reported the result of the * Not found.

They informed Congress that they had communicated to January 8th the bank the difficulties which occurred in granting a charter; but that they were answered, that the promise of a preceding Congress was binding on a subsequent one: that the subscribers would be free to with- draw their subscriptions, unless a charter should pass from Congress, and that tedious and expensive arrangements had been made for com- mencing the operations of the bank. The financier added, that a delay in these operations would injure him in his attempt towards a payment to the Army. Pressed as they were by these representations, Congress did incorporate the bank,- some of those who voted in the affirmative, thinking themselves obliged by the engagement in May, others contending for a constitutional power in these cases, and others assenting to it from absolute necessity. The resolution subjoined to the act, will therefore we hope, be complied with by the several legislatures— We have the honor, Sir, to be with great respect yr: Excellency's mo: ob't Servts."

A small schooner, the property of Mr. Peter Lafargue a french Gentleman, & Mr. John Michael, an Inhabitant of this County, inward bound, laden with Sugar, Earn and Dry goods, was unluckily taken by a New York Privateer at the Inlet near Hog island, the -owners applyed to me for a Flag in order to bring of the prisoners who ware taken in the said schooner. I haveing attained permission for a flag and proceeded on board the said privateer, they found that they could Eansom the said schooner on terms which they supposed advan- tageous, and accordingly applyed to me for permission, they Repre- sented to me that government having early in the fall impressed a Val- luable Vessel and Cargo of their's and they haveing yet Receiv'd no part of the valuation thereof, it was not in their power to pay the whole of ransom in money, but that they had on hand about thirty Hodgeheads Tobacco which if they might be allowed to pay as part of the Ransom they could procure the rest in Cash about 200£ & Effect the Ransom. Upon considering that Gov't hath never discovered any Jealousy in sup- plying the Enemy with Tobacco as I had understood that in several Ocations it had been sent to New York and Charleston, and that it never Cold be considered as furnishing the Enemy with the supplying either of a necessary of Life or War, Considering also that a Valuable Cargo of Necessaries for the use of this Countiy, as well as the enlarge- ment of 13 Prisoners wold be obtained by the Ransom, and that Mr. Lafargue, a gentleman who hath Left his native Country to releive the present distress of America, and hath manifested on every ocation, as well as his partner Mr. Michael, the greatest readiness to defend the cause of Liberty with his life and fortune, that Mr. Lafargue was at Lest entitled to Every advantage consistent with Law and the Customs of Nations and not inconsistent with the real Interest of America, to regain some small part of his property, having made so large a Sacrifice in the American Cause, I therefore permitted the Ransom to go on. the

Capt: Parker and the men with him, without doing more mischeif wantonly, Destroying a Hogshead of tobacco the property of the said Lafargue and Michael Returned to Accomac—About ten Days after, Capt: parker Returned with twenty men and seized the said Ransomed Schooner and Left the men on board as a guard, who are now without Commissioned Officers, in the most Disorderly manner, making waste of the Cargo." * * * ***** I have the honour to be your Excellency's most ob: Humble Servant" Jan'y 10th Jos: Jones to Gov: Harrison.

As Mr. Richmond Morris, the Superintendant of Finance has not as yet extended his con- tracts to Virginia or any other Southern State, the Continental Agents are left without any other means of obtaining forage or grain, except thro' the assistance of this State—This can only be done, by negotiating with the people through the County Commissioners and the Continental Agents, for part of the "Specifics" not due until next Spring, but which they may be induced to bring in now.

I have been particular in my enquiry in this matter before I ree'd your letter, the more especially as I was informed ill nature had said much on this and similar cases: the Quarter Master General recommended every assistance given the French, and throughout their whole march from the north ward, where they had no Agents, the Continental Agents furnish'd them, and with their money replac'd the goods again—I did so myself—I gave their Agent a quan- tity of Corn, and with their money replac'd it, and if any injury was committed, it was giving them old, Fly-eaten corn and receiving mer- chantable in its stead, and at that time it was the duty of every person to facilitate their march, the People being sore with their goods taken from them under the seizing Law, a law, my friend which I hope will 1 never again be reviv'd, took umbrage at their goods being taken from them and sold to the French, not considering, and perjiaps not knowing, that whenever it came to the continental agents' hands, it could not be restored to them again, and that he must account to his Superior for the disposal of everything received from the State or Bought by him.

These might be incorporated into a legion, to consist of five companies of Infantry, two of cavalry and oue of Artillery, the whole under command of a Lieutenant Colonel and a Major. The officers of infantry cavalry & artillery may rise in their respective lines, to the rank of Captain, and the Captains succeed to the rank of field officers according to the seniority of their commissions indiscriminately. The Officers of each corps (according to their present lines of service) might be directed to meet, and upou the principles of accommodation and mutual convenience, determine who of them should retire and who should continue; and if they cannot agree, the youngest should then give place, unless your Excellency should choose to nominate them yourself. Notwithstanding this incorporation, the two Western Companies might continue where they are, and if Government should think it best to detain the remainder on this side the mountains, the principal part of the cavalry might then be stationed in the Counties of Norfolk, Princess Anne, and Elizabeth City, and about 12 at Richmond for Expresses. Two companies of infantry might perhaps, with propriety be fixed at Portsmouth, especially while there are such numbers of dis- affected persons in that part of the Country. The other company of infantry might be stationed, one-half in Richmond and the other at the Point of Fork, as guards to the jail, and to the Continental and State magazines. The Artillery Company might be either ordered down the Ohio to General Clarke, with the pieces of Artillery your Excellency directed should be sent to him, or they might be stationed at Ports- mouth with the others. * Not found.

22 CALEKDAE OF STATE PAPEES. 1782. The Posts necessary therefore, to be attended to are, Jan'y 15th 1st. Portsmouth, where, if the before mentioned Troops are sent, there will be wanting about 150 rations of provisions a day, and about 70 forages a day for the horses— 2dly. At Hampton, 25 rations of provisions, and 30 forages a day, would be sufficient for the detachments to be stationed there. 3dly. At Eichmond, about 130 rations of provisions a day, will not be more than a sufficiency for the guards, expresses, and artificers, and for the express and wagon horses about 60 forages a day. 4thly. At the Point of Fork about 100 rations and 20 forages a day, will be necessary for the guard, the laboratory, the workmen now employed there, and the Artificers from Albemarle Barracks, who will move thither as soon as the buildings are prepared for them— 5thly. At Fredericksburg, tho' I confess I am not well acquainted with the arrangements made by Mr. Dick: but from his letters I think it will be necessary to provide for at least 50 men for the various purposes, at the gun factory, perhaps a few forages may be also wanting, as no doubt some waggons are necessary— When the buildings at the point of Fork are finished, there will be alterations in the quantity required at some of the posts, and a consid- erable diminution in the total. To superintend the issues of every kind, the quarter masters' depart- ment will be sufficient, as long as the posts are supplied by contract. At Portsmouth, the quarter master for this new legion would be fully sufficient, with the assistance of two or three sergeants, who may be always spared to execute the whole business of issues, both of provis- ions and forage. This charge, any captain or subaltern may be found to undertake, with only the common additional allowance to a quarter master in the army. At Fredericksburg, the same persons who have hitherto issued might still continue to do it, unless upon a more particular enquiry, there should appear to be some alterations necessary. At the point of Fork, a deputy quarter master and a storekeeper, with the assistance of a sergeant from the guard, will be sufficient for all the staff purposes of the post. At Eichmond, it will be necessary to have an assistant quarter mas- ter, a store-keeper, and waggon master, who should discharge all the business of feeding, foraging and transportation— Besides these it will be neeessary that the Quarter Master General should still be continued. To him should be made monthly returns of issues of every kind, at all the posts; and the different Agents before mentioned should be immediately accountable to him: indeed if they are not, there will be nothing to prevent the most shameful misapplica- tion of the public Stores. This business will make it necessary that he be allowed a clerk.
Page 23
CALENDAK OF STATE PAPBES. 23 with this arrangement, the whole business of the quarter-masters, 1782. commissarys' and forge masters departments, maybe executed with an Jan'y 15th amazing reduction of expence, as the persons I have before mentioned will be sufficient for all these purposes in our present circumstances— As to the Military Stores department, Capt: Pryor has been of such eminent utility, that if continued, much advantage might be expected from his services—Should government however, think fit to reduce that department, the duties of it may be done in this office, with the aid of the quarter master's department, and the liberty of occasionally employ- ing an officer from the state troops with a small additional allowance, to act as conductor, when necessary. The superintendent of the labora- tory may be also, keeper of the magazines, and invalid soldiers are very proper to be employed under him. as the clothing of the continental troops, raised by this state, is by an official letter from the minister of war, no longer to be provided for by this state, and as many articles formerly purchased by this state are now to be furnished by contract, the whole department of commissary of stores may be abolished & if necessary the whole business, which is no more than to receive and issue the stores to the different departments, may be executed by a common store-keeper. Indeed I do not see the inconveniency of the different departments, drawing what they want, . immediately from the commercial agent, as there will not be much trouble in doing this business, reduced as it will be by the new arrange- ment. There will be some difficulty perhaps in providing for the sick. I am convinced it will be unnecessary to keep up a hospital department, unless the person acting as the physician will keep a large apothecary shop on public account, as Doctor Pope proposes. A regimental surgeon and mate, will be necessary for the troops; one may stay at Portsmouth and the other at the point of York. I have thus taken the liberty, agreeable to your Excellencys7 direc- tions in council, to state my sentiments according to the best of my judgment, respecting the reduction and regulation of the different departments, connected with the military establishments of This State. I say nothing of the naval, as it is not within the objects of my office, nor am I competent to judge of it. If in any of the proposed arrange- ments I have calculated upon two small a scale, it is in that for the military stores, I however, submit it for the consideration of Govern- ment, and have the honor to be, Your Excellencys' mo: obed't and most humble servant—

E. Kello to Grov: Harrison. Jan'y 16th Declining the "honour of so distinguished and important an office" as "Judge of Oyer & Terminer at Portsmouth,"—"The very precarious state of his health is his reason for this step. If he could possibly travel so far, "his word of honour is engaged already professionally"— concludes "I always think myself bound to give my services to my country whenever able or equal to the task, but the reasons I have assigned will I hope plead my apology for declining the honour of the present appointment." Daniel Clark Atty: for Oliver Pollock, to Gov: Harrison— Jan'y 17th Enclosing claim of the latter against The State of Virginia, amounting to "139739.li, Dollars, money advanced to the Western Troops—' "Sir ****** "The balance in favour of Mr. Pollock appears great, but as the Kichmond whole has been an expenditure for the purpose of supporting your army to the Westward, which could not possible subsist, or continue in that Service, had not Mr. Pollock generously exerted himself on their behalf, I hope Sir, no difficulty will be made in settling his accounts— I pray your Excellency will be pleased to consider what Troops this State has had to the Westward, how long they were at the Islenois and Iron mines, from whence they were supplied, and by whom, and what orders were given to Col: Clark on going there ?—I beleive Sir, after making these enquiries, you will find that he had little or no supplies from Virginia, and that his orders were to procure all necessaries for the support of his army, and the use of the Service he was upon, and in payment to draw Bills on the Treasury of this Commonwealth. To give value and currency to those Bills, on which depended the subsistence of the Forces in that Quarter, Mr. Pollock did, with more zeal than pru- dence, exert himself—He expended his own fortune which was respect- able, in honouring those Bills, and borrowed money on his own Credit 4
Page 26
26 CALENDAE OF STATE PAPEES. 1782. for the same purpose, to a very considerable amount. To my knowledge Jan'y 17th Mr. Pollock owes at this hour, upwards of eighty thousand dollars, which he borrowed for the service of this State. Permit me Sir, with all immaginable respect, to observe, that to delay Justice to so active and disinterested a Friend to your cause, as he has been, will he thought an ungenerous requital by all the World. Unless your Excellency will be pleased to take Mr. Pollock's case into considera- tion and to order an immediate adjustment of his accounts, his Creditors will no longer forbear with him. As soon as I return to new Orleans, if I should be unsuccessful in my application to your Excellency on his behalf, he will most assuredly be deprived of his liberty. If his accounts are now settled, though payment be deferred a Year or longer, it will in some measure appease his clamorous creditors, and keep him from experiencing the miseries of a loathsome Prison. It has been observed that Mr. Pollock had no authority to act as agent for this commonwealth, because he had not a formal appointment from it for that purpose. On considering that he was agent for the United States, and applied to by this Government to transact business for them, his conduct approved of, and the officers of the State in that Quarter, continuing to draw Bills upon him, your Excellency I hope will be of opinion that these several circumstances amount to a full recognition of his agency. But Sir, any man who chose to have confidence in the State had a right to do what Mr. Pollock has done, viz: to honour the Bills drawn on your Treasury by the Commanding officers of the State in that part of the country. The monies advanced by Mr. Pollock for the Commonwealth of Yirginia, I beleive, have been bona fide, applied to its Service, no abuses could be committed by Pollock unless the officers and he had combined to defraud the State. This I conceive to be impossible, for those kind of collusions can seldom be found, but where a personal acquaintance of the Parties exist. Col: Clark never saw Pollock—they were at least four or five hundred Leagues apart, while that Gentleman commanded to the westwasd; that a scheme of peculation should be brought about, and entered into by them, and carried on by an epistolary correspondence, is impossible. Besides Sir, Col: Clark's conduct during his residence and command in that country was approved of. He was promoted to an honourable rank after he was called from thence, and if I am well informed, was, or is to be rewarded with a large tract of land. This proves Col: Clark to be an officer of merit. It has been also said, that Mr. Pollock had vended goods to your army at an exorbitant advance, was I examined on Oath on this subject, I would say that I do not know whether Mr. Pollock ever did sell any goods to your officers or not; but if he had, he could not practiced any imposition, or commit any fraud, without the concurrence of the com- manding officers, for he has vouchers from them for all his demands against this State. Mr. Pollock when agent for the United States was
Page 27
CALENDAR OF STATE PAPERS. 27 not prohibited from carrying on his business- as a merchant; and while 1782. at liberty to trade I do not see why it should be thought more criminal Jan'y 17th in him to supply your Troops, than any other Trader. It was said, when I had the honour last summer to wait on your Excellency's predecessor, that Col: Montgomery had no authority from the State to draw Bills on your Treasury. This position I cannot deny, not knowing how far the power given Col: Clark in that case extended; but whatever power was given to him by Government, I do, with due submission imagine, would necessarily descend to Col: Montgomery, his successor in command, the instant the command devolved upon him, particularly in devising means for the support of his Troops. It was likewise observed that all Public Bills drawn by the officers of Virginia to the Westward, on the Treasury, were to be paid by a scale of depreciation—a scale that was graduated here by Genl: Clark after his return from the Islenois, and long after he and the other officers had drawn the Bills in question. It is needless to observe to your Excellency, who knows it already, that Bills of Exchange are negociable eveiy where, and fluctuate in their value as well as in any other commercial article or commodity, according to their scarcity or plenty. Bills of Exchange are drawn fair, specifying the sum in the currency of the country when drawn, or if varying from it, particularly mentioning the same, and acknowledging value received. If your officers intended that these Bills, at the time of drawing them should be paid conformable to a scale of depreciation or, in any other currency or coin, than that of the country in which they drew them, the Bills themselves "would have mentioned it, that foreigners or people at a distance, to whom they were afterwards offered for sale, might judge of their real value. This was not done. The Bills are well drawn, expressing not a word of depreciation, and will, on every princi- ple of Law and justice, bind this State to discharge them, according to the expressed Sums in Specie. Bills of Exchange, drawn lately in America, for the support of the Armies of France serving in America, have been sold nearly Sterling for currency; but the Government has not refused to pay them, because they sold under value. This preceded from the exigencies of the Times, and nature of the services; Govern- ment soon saw the disadvantage of raising money to support its army by drawing Bills, and therefore sent money to America for that purpose. But Sir, if France could not have sent money to America, her servants would* continue to draw Bills as usual—So, please your Excellency, it was with Yirginia. The government knew long ago, the enormous expence it was at, in the maintaining an army on the mississippi, but had it not, like France, in their power to prevent it by sending supplies of any kind immediately from hence, nor were they able to pay the Bills drawn by their officers, with punctuality when presented here. This Sir, is the true reason that your western accounts are so large, and in my opinion, that the accounts are so, is not to be ascribed to Frauds

28 CALENDAE OF STATE PAPEES. 1T82. or abuses committed by your Servants, or to any other cause than the Jan'y 17tb deranged State of your Finances, and perhaps some inattention in the directors of your affairs; for example, Keeping People that came fifteen hundred or two thousand miles, at a vast risk and expence, ten or twelve months, before they could obtain a settlement of their accounts, con- tributes greatly to give Yirginia bad credit abroad, and is, with due Submission, what I call inattention in them. I am an instance of this. Had the Executive been pleased to do for me last summer, as the General Assembly have done now, it would have saved me some hundreds of Pounds, much mortification, Fatigue, and Insult, and I would have been some months ago with my family, from whom, I am now nearly twelve months absent. Information and intelligence even from an humble Hand, will always be received by a wise man publickly employed in the Service of his Country, but particularly the Chief magistrate will find it essentially necessary to gain all he can, in order to enable him the more perfectly to discharge the Duties of the Trust reposed in him, and to see justice impartially administered between the Public and the Individual. I shall therefore beg your Excellencys leave to inform you of the nature of our Trade from new Orleans to the Islenois, as it is somewhat connected with the general subject of my Letter, and perhaps not unuseful to you. From new Orleans to the Islenois is 500 Leagues. A very considerable commerce is carried on between these two places—Orleans furnishes them with arms, ammunition, Indian and other Dry Goods, Eum, Wine, Sugar, Coffee, &c. &c. &c. And they, in exchange send us deer-skins, Beaver, otter, and other kind of Furs, with a small quantity of Flour. The Trader at new Orleans purchases his goods from the importer, at an advance in War Time, from two to three hundred pr: Cent: on the Sterling cost. He carries them in large Batteaux to the Islenois, rowed by twenty four Oars, and is from eighty five to ninety Days ascending— On his arrival there, he sells bis cargoes to the Traders of the Country, at an advance of two hundred pr: cent: on the Orleans Invoice; so that every Article of Goods sold them, comes to the purchaser eight or nine hundred per' Cent: on the original Cost. It is from one or other of these People, that your officers have been under the mortifying necessity of purchasing the Goods, with which the necessaries for the subsistence of the Army have been procurred. With these dear bought Goods, they purchased the friendship of the Indians, who are now attached to your Interest; and for these dear-bought Goods, these Bills have been .drawn on the Treasury of Virginia, or on Mr. Pollock at new Orleans— These facts I mention to your Excellency with a view to show you the reasons and circumstances that have combined to make your public Expences so enormous to the Westward; but great as they are, yet greater are the benefits you have and will derive from them—You have Sir, taken possession, and I hope secured the remotest part of your present territorial claim, and perhaps the finest country on Earth. You
Page 29
OALBNDAE OP STATE PAPEKS. 29 have made yourselfs respectable among the Indians of that country; and 1782. secured their friendship—You have prevented the British and their Jan'y 17th Indian Allies from taking possession of that Country; and thereby opened and secured a communication to new Orleans where your back- settlers on the Ohio will always meet with a friendly reception, and a good market for their Produce—And you have Sir, in all human proba- bility prevented the British of Detroit, and their Indians from joining Lord Cornwallis, while he was in the full career of a successful invader, over-running this Country. Such a junction Sir, at that time would have been fatal to Yirginia. I shall conclude this long Letter with a Prayer on behalf of my Con- stituent, that your Excellency will not suffer a faithful servant to fall a sacrifice to his Zeal for the honour and Service of Yirginia; that you will not suffer a Family to be reduced to misery and distress, which, before Mr. Pollock accepted the Agency of the United States, and Virginia employed him, lived in affluence and ease. That you will be pleased to order his accounts to be settled without delay, or that you will be pleased to pass such resolves in Council in his Favour, for such Sums, as you shall believe to be justly due to him; that by assigning the same to his Creditors, they may be for the present appeased, and he at liberty to wait on your Excellency here, with such Proofs as will satisfy you of his probity and integrity in your Service, and prove to you and to mankind that his accounts are fair, just and honest. His character as Agent for the United States entitles him to a respect, which I am sorry to say has not been sufficiently attended to. When the great officers of Government treat the inferior ones with contempt and neglect, they never will be well served. Shall Mr. Pollock be obliged to attend like a common claimant at Kentucky, not to receive his money then," but to supplicate for a settlement of the money he gener- ously and disinterestedly advanced for the public Service of his Country. Richmond, with due submission, Sir, is the Place where the accounts of Mr. Pollock should be proven, and if he has committed Yillianies, then he should be made a public Example in terrorem. In justice to my constituent, and to the honour of Truth, without any self interest or view of Interest, I have dwelt long upon this Subject, and I fear have trespassed on your Excellencys' Patience—I wish for no more than to see Justice take place between Yirginia and her Servant Pollock, who to my knowledge, when the event of ye war was doubtful and the Independence of America uncertain, virtuously, and like a true Whig advanced his Fortune in support of her Cause. Ruin, from a victorious British Enemy, Pollock might reasonably expect, but from a victorious friend, from Virginia, to whose service his Life and Fortune have been devoted, he had reason to expect at least a just, if not general acquital— I have the Honor to be with the most profound Respect, Sir Your Excellency's most obedient and most humble Servant."

Richmond Considering his appointment as having been discontinued by the last G-enl: Assembly, he takes the earliest opportunity, the distressed con- dition of his family will allow, to account for the medical Stores in his charge, and to request that some one be appointed to be responsible for them. The molasses, Wine, Tea, and remnant of oznaburgs are at his house in Powhatan; and he hopes they may be removed as soon as possi- ble. A considerable quantity of stores remain at Wms'burg, which he has just ordered to be brought up to Richmond: an invoice of which will be made out as soon as they arrive—While he is in this part of the Country he will cheerfully render the State any Service he can.

The troops under this last circumstance are to be supplyed by Con- gress. Congress have agents for that purpose, but they are little sup- plyed with means & as the money which they receive is not much more than equal to their wages & commissions, they eassy account for the over- plus for their travels and other expenses, of the kind in which the troops have no part. Their general resource is to give Certificates whose numbers & nominal value increasing in a higher proportion than the taxes which they are received to pay for, has no other effect than to disgust the people & create in them the greatest backwardness to make any advances to the Continent—from this spring the misery of the Soldiers, the difficulty of maintaining the troops already raised, the impossibility of completing the several corps & of course the Army. I am told that other measures will soon be taken to provide the troops. I wishe it may be so, but what is to be done untill that time. my legion is ordered here by the Commander in Chief, with whom the several states represented in Congress have left the disposal of their troops—his orders to me are to fill up the legion with recruits, to clothe, equip & mount them and then to joign the Army and take the field.
Page 32
32 CALENDAR OF STATE PAPEES. 1782. I have already a pretty large number of men—in a short time I expect Jan'y 17th to have all my horses—the greatest part of the equipments & all the cloathing are here because I have payed myself the carry age of them from richmond to this post—the remainder is at richmond—the cloath- ing is in the hands of eighteen taillors—& what repairing is necessary to the sadles &c will be done with the Cloathing— must I leave this post with my men, leave the cloathing here, put to another time the recruiting of men & wait for other circumstances to get them properly mounted & equipped & regulated—should I take those steps for which I could never account for to Congress and the Commander in chief, my men would desert the horses perish, no recruits could be made & the equipments & clothing be destroyed, but on the other hand, what means have I to remain at this post, now, since the power given to the Commissioners for supplying forage & provisions for the Conti- nental troops have been taken from them, & if your excellency does not consider the legion for the benefit of allowance granted to the Virginia troops, as those troops themselves, or order some other measures to be taken, it will be impossible to subsist our men & horses & to keep in our conduct the regularity of proceeding subjected by the late resolution of Assembly, what your excellency had done in our favour in respect to grain taxes has not had any effect till this day & probably will not have more while we are here—the people has taken such an advantage of the last resolution, against impressing, that some who had engaged their waggons & Served the legion for some time have gone back with their waggons. I wishes you would give me directions & assistance for the time we have to stay here by all what has hindered my Cloathing to come sooner will be six weeks—before that time we can not possibly move, without discharging the men & give up the horses & cloathing. I am with the highest respect Sir, your mst obt Sevt. Should it be necessary to have served the state in which we are stationed, to draw of him the same advantages that his own troops. I could say that my legion has been destroyed in the province of Virginia during last Campaign, men & horses killed, others taken, three officers taken which are not exchanged yet, but are much wanted—I could to this add an uncommon instence, which is the Service of my officers of the horse in the beseiging of York—Cavallery had no occasion to serve there & those officers offered often time the sacrifice of their lives to the good example which an enterprise required."

Sir, with very sincere respect, yr: obt. Servt" Jan'y 18th MAJOR CLAIBORNE TO THE GOVERNOR. Kichmond He is very sorry that the executive disapprove of his moving his office to Fredericksburg; and although he is "very much disposed" to oblige the Executive, the duty he owes to his creditors, to the United States and to himself oblige him to this step. The State having with- drawn "every Kind of supply" from his department, except upon special occasions, but little business intercourse can exist between them. In addition to this, he has not a house in which to hold his office, the one now occupied by him being sold and possession demanded—The two clerks he had have left him and he finds it impossible to supply their places "in this time." By removing he will have power to remedy these and other evils. Therefore for these and other reasons heretofore as- signed, and being conviced the affairs of his office can be better conducted by the change, he trusts the Executive will not only be put to no inconve- nience by it, but will themselves see the propriety of the move—■

Jan'y 18 th When Col: Dabneys troops arrived at that place, the Small pox Portsmouth "raged not only in Town, but in all the neighbouring country—Some of them took it and died, and he was applied to, in the absence of their surgeon, to innoculate them. This he did, at great inconvenience to the Country people who needed his services for the same purpose. He hopes the State will pay his account £100.16s.—He is not so unreason- able as to expect instant payment, but only wants some official recog- nition of his claim. Concludes "did I not know that men of discern- ment, of steadiness & of integrity were much wanted in the manage- ment of our, unweildy political machine, I should, as once before, intreat you to return and follow your profession, which would yield you in ye course of a few years an independent fortune, this is paying you no compliment, for its impossible to do Justice to the ignorance of our Lawyers or Magistrates." Major Claiborne to the Governor Jan'y 18th Informing him of an arrangement entered into between himself and Richmond Major Carrington, in order to furnish forage for the three Continental Stations in Yirginia, the cavalry, waggon horses &c. His Agents are to contract for corn, oats, hay and "corn fother" at the current prices, payable in six months. If payment should not be made at the expira- tion of that time, "four shillings specie pr: bushel is to be allowed for Corn; three shillings specie for Oats, and four pounds ten shillings pr: Ton for Hay or Corn fother"—He has extended this principle to contracts for wood, "allowing one fourth of the first price" to be added if not paid for as above—He again informs his Excellency of his determination to move his office to Fredericksburg and gives the reasons therefor.

"You will also apply to the Governor to have 2,000 Head of Cattle put up to stall feed, without loss of time, as cattle here will soon be unfit for use, and besides which they begin to be exceeding difficult to be got—Should the Cattle be generally small, I would wish not less than 3,000 head he put up—You will also represent our deplorable situation

These Articles may be forwarded to G-eorgetown from Chesapeake in swift sailing small craft. It would be infinitely the Cheapest, least difficult, and by far the most expeditious mode of forwarding supplies; nor do I think the vessells, if they keep close in shore, will run any great risque. This business should be mentioned to Major Forsyth, if he is in Virginia, as well as to the Governor of the state—you know our necessities, and you will press our wants." Jan'y 19th Col: DAVIES TO THE GOVERNOR. Sir War Office In obedience to your Excellency's directions, I have the honor to enclose to you, a return of the persons employed in the different depart- ments expressed in the order of Council of yesterday. The whole of the Deputy Commissioners in the State are now out of office, in conse- quence of the expiration of the law. There was one in each County, except two or three beyond the mountains. There were no Commis- sioners of the provision law last year, except in some of the Counties where there was no Deputy Commissioners Appointed, and in them the Commissioners of the provision law for the year So undertook to act. I have not yet obtained any return from Dr. Pope, but I believe he has no more than one shop-keeper and three attendants a nurses at the hospital. The department of military stores is certainly too large for the present circumstances of the State. I have therefore mentioned it to Capt: Pryor, who tells me the collection of the Arms has made it necessary hitherto, but that in future, a very considerable reduction may be made unless another invasion should take place— I beg leave to enclose to your Excellency a resolution of Congress of an old date, lately sent me from General Green. I find it entirely con- trary to the Continental regulations to furnish their troops with Cloath- ing; but as I have never been able to get the sight of their Journals for more than a year past, I had it not in my power, to know what was right or wrong. I hope however the distress of our Soldiers will be a justification for our issues— I have the honor to be your Excellency's most obt hbl Servt."

Jan'y 19th "Sir Your letter of the 12th present was handed to me this day—nothing Charlottes- can surprise me more than the complaints mentioned in it of my laying ville the inhabitants under the oppression of the impressments of their waggons & forrage. I can not qualify this rapport made to you by other words than impossition & untruth—as I am sensible the governor & senat of Virginia does not fix their Ideas, Judgements of things & determinations upon insignificant proofs, which are endeavoured to be given by way of complaints. I am anxious to preserve their esteem & therefore request them to take all the measures that can openly & pub- lickly explain my conduct, which means of proceeding I dare say your Excellency is sensible of, are proper to me to insist upon. I submit voluntarily to the determinations of any persons which the executive shall plejise to send here & apprise themselves with the particulars of my conduct—even of those who brought the complaints against me, provided an honest man is sent along with them—I would wish & give my utmost consent to be trayed on my impressing waggons & forrage^ by the inhabitants of this neighborhood, which if oppression on those heads has taken place in my conduct, must as the nearest at hand have sufferd the most under it—I do not wishe to have a single witness in my side, what I ask for is all the witness that can be found against me. I can not help answering the assertion contained in your letter—that your country contend in vain with her enemy\ if she suffer those who are to be her friends to treat her with the same inhumanity that the former would do—& my answer to it is contained in those few words—which is the american boon, or any other that has made greater sacrifices to the liberty of america & given her more proof of friendship than Colonel Armand— the answer to this will be the answer to the assertion—I had the honour to wraite to your excellency the day before yesterday & gave you an account of the present situation of the legion, that corps cannot move from here unless he is disbanded—the men & horses cannot subsist without they are provided with rations by the country, this part affoard a plainty of grain & forrage—the means to get it are not in my power & I am entirely ready to leave the whole at your disposal & to retire myself.

I do not mean by this, thier orders to impress, or their calling back their act against impressing which I dare say is very proper & agreeable to the times—but by permitting some exchange of flour which is far of this place against flour which some of the inhabi- tants around here would deliver to the legion on those terms. I am sorry Capt: Sharp has not keapt his temper in the bounds of his respect for the Council & your Excellency dictated to him. he is born in this country & a man of a reputable conduct & bearing before the enemy. I have reprimanded him & as your complaints of him make me entirely conscious of the great impropriety of his conduct, I beg leave to refer wholy to you to dictate the mode of separation which his offence & true repentance of it will suggest to your excellency, until your com- mands on that head that officer will remain at Charlottesville, which place he was to quit to morrow, to go recruiting. I am obliged by the confidence you are pleased to have in my way of thinking & I shall be always happy to maintain your esteem by my way of acting. Col: Carrington had wrote to me that previous to his going to the north, he would take some measures with the executive for supplying the legion &that he would wraite to me accordingly. I have not received any letter since, but as he could not act without the execu- tive, I continue to rely on what this last will do for the legion.

Wm. Eonald to Gov. Harrison. Jan'y 20th "Sir Col: Febiger who commands at Cumberland Old Ch: House informs Powhatan me the troops at that station suffer very much from want of provisions, Co* they have not had any kind of meat for about fourteen days, and very little expectations of procuring any. in this Situation, Col: Febiger has sollicited several of the inhabitants to contribute to their temporary relief, and has requested their influence in procuring a proper supply— for this reason I take the liberty of addressing your excellency on the subject, making you a tender of any services it may be in my power to render the troops—I cannot command ready money, but if my private Credit can be of service in procuring an immediate supply I shall not scruple to pledge it for a moderate sum, provided I have your Excellency's approbation, and you will be pleased to direct the officers of Govern- ment to take such steps as the Law will warrant to indemnify the Inhabitants who may exert themselves on this occasion. The Court of Powhatan have appointed Commissioners to collect the tax of 2 lbs Bacon pr: poll, many of the people seem disposed to pay it immediately, and are willing to pay three pounds of Salted pork in lieu of two pounds of Bacon—The Commissioners only wait your Excellency's orders for the application of this meat, which I presume you will direct to be delivered to those troops— This tax on the County of Powhatan will only yield meat for Eight or Ten days"—He recommends the course adapted by Powhatan, be recommended by his Excellency to Amelia, Cumberland and Goochland, giving Col: Febiger authority to receive the provisions supplied by them—He has already authorized the Commissioner who usually supplies those troops, to purchase to the amount of "one hundred pounds" on his own private credit, payable in six months—This however will not go very far, as the "pork season is now over" and the "cattle not fit for Slaughter." But if a much larger amount can be made up, considerable purchases may be made in the lower Counties on the credit of the

Recommends that a person be appointed to make such purchases, Jan'y 20th the money thus expended to be regarded as lent to the Treasury of the State, and the receipts given by him receivable by the sheriffs for taxes from the holders. 'In this way, he thinks "many of the principal people" will pledge their private credit to procure provisions for the troops, but adds, "from the people at large I fear no advances can be immediately expected, as they are a good deal disappointed on finding that the certifi- cates obtained for provisions formerly supplied will not pay any of their taxes, and it will require considerable time to reconcile them to that measure." Jan'y 20th J AMES PATILLO TO Col: DAVIES. Cumberland Fourteen months have passed since he was under command of the Old Col: at Chesterfield Ct: House, since which time he has been doing severe duty in the Quarter Master and Commissary's Depts: and in the line without one shilling of pay, and not one article of clothing but one pair of shoes and one pair of Stockings—He has resigned the service entirely, not being able to find himself in Clothing, and pocket money, and must starve if he continues. Begs to know how he can obtain his "pay a deficiencys in clothing" or a certificate which will enable him to "demand it when money is to be had." January 21st COL. DAVIES TO THE GOVERNOR. War Office He has been applied to by several of the Counties to know whether the recruiting service under the Act passed at Staunton should go on. What law has expired? and as it requires a Proclamation from the Executive to resume the draft, it is contended that no authority exists to do this, until such proclamation be issued—Chesterfield County among others, on this account refuses to furnish any men. Being at a loss on this Subject, and not having a copy of the Acts of Assembly, he requests instructions—Calls attention of the Governor to the fact, that "a considerable portion of our infantry engaged for the war" are now at Fort Pitt, and adds "For those men the State gets little Credit, and the attention of every body that wishes to know the force Virginia keeps in the field is turned, not to Fort Pitt, but to General Green's Army—They see nothing of these men on his Keturns, and of course the State appears, in a more difficult point of view than she ought to, and exposed to an additional load of obloquy. I have been told that there are at least 120 men there of the Yirginia Line enlisted for the war, most of the officers are desirous to leave that Post and to join the rest of the line, but the Colonel lives there, and would probably be much averse to leaving it."

Irwin of Pensyva: has authority to reorganize the troops at Fort Pitt, January 21st and as Col: Broadhead of the Pensylvania Egt. there, is the senior officer to the Yirginia Colonel, it may be that the whole of the Vir- ginians have been incorporated with the Batallion with the Pensylvanians under Broadhead. In as much as he has never giving instructions that the Militia of the Counties in Yirginia adjacent to that Post, should be under the orders of Genl: Irwin, not having authority from the Execu- tive to do so, he shall await their action in the matter.

Hopes soon to have Eussia sheeting out of which to make some; but as nearly all his tailors are about to leave him, for want of the Specie to pay them, he cannot promise much work in the future. Thinks it would be proper to order the Soldiers at Cumberland Old Ct: House who are good tailors to report to him; more good to be done by this step, as he could then have shirts made for the army. The few tailors he has are at work for Col: Armand; but should rather be employed making over-alls & vests for the Yirginia Line. He is determined not to allow his Shoe-makers to make Boots &c for his Legion. Eeturns thanks for his efforts to procure him his pay, and adds "I wish I may be D d if I have had one Shilling my own proporty for near Two Months, & what is nearly as bad I am almost naked for want of Cloaths"—Begs to be allowed to draw from Mr. Dyer Some "thin French Cloth in the State," not fit for the Soldiers; for which he will pay Mr. Eoss in Tobacco.

This Sir, I am constrained to do, from the many and heavy losses I have suffered already by serving them, and not receiving a single shilling, for my last six months expensive services renders it out of my power to continue longer without being totally ruined. I have not a single ounce of provision laid in for the support of my Family for the ensuing Tear, nor is it in my power to purchase any; consequently I can no longer support my Family together. So far from engaging in the Service of the Public again, my whole time and thoughts are employed in collecting the Scattered and tattered remains of the little all I have left, before it be too late, in order to dispose of, to save myself and those dependent on me from starving; reasons sufficient I natter myself for declining the appointment, you will therefore as speedily as possible appoint another to act in my stead, as the sick are suffering for want of proper attendance and necessaryS.

Perhaps some of the Medical Gentlemen of the town, "will undertake this business" at the rate of "twenty shillings a day, without forage or rations," which will save expence to the State.

I had previous to the rec't of the Commission directed the Clerk to write to the magistrates to desire their attendance, four of which with the gentleman who was to qualifie as sheriff did attend. It was their opinion that we could not set, to do business in any other House but the Court house, which at present is used by the French as an Hospital, the variety of disorders therein, and the disagreeable smell of the House deter'd the Gentlemen from going in. I thought it proper to acquaint yr: Excellency, as perhaps by an application from you the House may be given up—the necessity for a Sheriff and Court in this County was perhaps never greater than at present, the situation of the inhabitants of this Town is peculearly hard. If the French army are to stay any time, we hope Barracks will be built to the chimneys of the former. There is I suppose upwards of a hundred negroes in this Town & York, they are really a great nuisance—I wish something could be done with them, it would be useless for me to have them taken up, as we have no prison to confine them in, nor no guard to escort them else- where. I am with great respect yr: Excellency's mo: obt. Servant— January 23d Maj: K. CLAIBORNE TO Gov: HARRISON. Richmond Mr. Jameson has just informed him of his Excellency's great objec- tion to the removal of his office to Fredericksburg—This induces him to refer to the matter once more, to prove that the measure is rendered absolutely necessary for the reasons heretofore given. But he assures his Excellency, that if he will enable him to remedy the evils now in the way of the discharge of the duties of his Office, he will cheerfully remain at the Seat of Government; in as much as the proposed move is of necessity, and not of his choice.

But when the Beef, or rather Carrion, that came from Rich- 1782. mond is to be issued, there will be a greater cause of Complaint, it will January 23d be to morrow. I shall attend the issue myself—Although 1 assure you from the stench of the meat it's dangerous to be near it. The Resolves of council is very good. But unless it is communicated to the Commissioners of Countys from your Authority, I fear it will have but little Effect. I have wrote Major Forsyth, he has no Resource in the world but the Carrion from Richmond or Manchester. I am informed all the Troops to the Northward of us, as also the different stations, is supplied entirely by contract, was this to be the case here we would fare much better as several gentlemen would undertake to supply the Post. Yours of the 21st by Mr. Logwood came to hand last night. I had received a Letter from Genl: Greene, of the 29th ultimo: by Capt: Rags- dell, in which he pres'd the marching of the Troops at this Station. In Consequence of which I have issued orders for the Detachment to be in Readiness to march at a moment's warning—Notwithstanding my repeated applications to the Q. Master's Department, I have yett obtained but very few Articles of those wanted. I have long since sent my Esti- mate. I sent my Quarter Master in person, all I received was 400 Knapsacks, I Rheam of paper, and an order on Ross' Works for one Ton of Iron. Upwards of a month ago, I obtained an order on Major Magill for some canteens. I sent the order but received none, neither have we a single order book or a sheet of paper. I also obtained an Order from Carington for Arms and Accoutrements compleat. I sent for them, but could obtain none better than those we have, however in this Article I can manage so as not to detain the Troops a moment on that account. I shall write Genl: Greene, and state matters to him. I am extreamly uneasy about his situation, and shall exert every nerve to gett the Detachment off. A Scene of Villiany has been carried on, between the Inhabitants and Soldiery, that would astonish you, although every precaution has been taken to prevent such an Intercourse—Major Finley will inform you of the particulars. I am extreamly sorry it is out of the power of Government to furnish us money, if it was ever so little, it would have a happy effect. The Officers I am in hopes can manage so as to assist each other. I would therefore propose (as the old Soldiers' year ended the whole grumble exceedingly) that £4 or 500, say 14 or 1500, which I am sure Government might borrow, should be imme- diately put in the hands of the Continental Paymaster, from him to Lut: Storkley or myself, and then proportion it to each non comis'd Officer and Soldier who marches with the Detachment. I beg you to make use of every means in your power to effect this purpose, and inform me of your prospects by Scott or Finley, whoever comes up first, when the money is paid an Account might be lodged with the Auditors. By these means and my marching the Troops out of the State myself, I could gett them off very well contented. As I have but a very super-

I have spoke with a number of the Officers on the ill conse- quences it would be productive of, to dispose of their Certificates at less than their real value, and shall as you propose advise some of them to dispose of theirs for the benefit of the whole, in such manner as not to give a stab to their future Credit. I wish the next Session of Assembly may act decisively in this Matter: we must depend on you to procure from John Pierce Esqr. Paymaster G-enl: in Philadelphia an Account of the Time the Different Corps has been paid off up to the last day of November 1779, as also an Account of what money the Officers respec- tively have drawn.

We are confi- dent that every measure tending to the secure transportation of these Stores will be adopted, and particularly that they will be sent under a convoy of a convenient force, if it be practicable. We shall inform the Governor of Virginia of the Steps which we have now taken, and doubt not that they will prove acceptable. Altho' Mr. Harrison, who negociated these supplies with you, men- tions in his Letter of the 29th of May last, the propriety of sending them to the Delaware, yet we beg leave to refer you to his preceding Letter of the 17th Feb'y, in which he observes, "that it would add greatly to the obligation if the Stores could be transported in a Frigate to York Town in Virginia." The latter Letter having been written at a season when our posts were infested by British vessels. We conceive that the former suggests for our present circumstances, the most con- venient & advantageous plan. But should the position of the enemy make it unsafe to enter Chesapeake Bay, we are convinced that due precaution will be taken." In reply to a letter from the Count de Vergennes in France, dated Oct: 8th 1781 to the Chevalier de la Luzerne at Philadelphia, informing him that the "Articles to be furnished to the State of Virginia" would soon be ready for delivery, and enquiring whether they should be sent iu vessels despatched for that purpose, or be transported in French vessels, the Genl: Assembly of Va upon this being communicated to them, through their Committee, resolved that the Governor be desired to inform the Chev: de la Luzerne French minister at Philadelphia, that they preferred these goods should be "transmitted in ships of France "as suggested by the Count de Vergennes, in his letter of the 8th Oct: 1781. Col: Davies to Gov: Harrison. Jan'y 24th Expresses regret to find that this Council are still averse to his mov- Richmond ing his office to Fredericksburg.

As soon as he was informed that "two horsemen would be stationed as Express-riders" at Bowling Green, he gave orders to the A. D. Quarter M. at Fredericksburg to have them supplied with forage &c— Jan'y 25th STEPHEN SOUTHALL, Lt: OF ARTILLERY TO CoL: DaVIES. Cumberland By the late Eesolution of the Genl: Assembly, Continental officers 01<Ct House can ^raw a year's Pay in Certificates: he therefore begs his assistance, in procuring one for him, as he will soon have to march Southward and is without money or credit to pay his necessary expenses.

Eandolph, Auditors, certify to the impossibility of Auditor's complyhig with the requirements of the Executive, "respecting the expenditures on the western waters," unless a competent clerk can be employed to investigate the accounts, which are so "complex and intricate" that an accurate statement is almost impracticable— February 1st Col: Davies to the Governor. War Office Kepresenting in urgent terms the necessities of Mr. Anderson, the superintendent of the public shops, who cannot longer continue in the Service of the State, unless supplied with funds for his own personal releif; and whose workmen are idle for want of material—He is fully aware of "the embarassment of Gov'rnment." but his duty requires he should make this representation.

CALENDAB OP STATE PAPEES. 49 Major J. Poulson, Com'd'g E. Shore of Va. to Col: Davies. 1782. February 1st He has made no report since his arrival on that shore, because thiere Pungoteague were no arms or anything else to equip the men drafted by Accomac -A-ccomack- and Northampton Go's. There are thirty or forty substitutes in Acco- mac, furnished when the draft was opposed in that County, and a few deserters. As soon as he got over, he notified the County Lieutenants, and there was no delay in their action. The men are coming in and he sends Capt. Parker for Arms and clothing for them. The men who opposed the draft all expect to furnish substitutes, for the war. North- ampton Co., who first set the example, "held a Court and Condemned the men" but have never had instructions how to dispose of them. It will be a great hardship "to pass over" these offenders and punish others. But he hopes none of them will be dealt with, and wishes instructions on the subject. He sends Capt: Parker with the hope, that he may be enabled to equip the men in a Soldier like manner, and get a vessel to bring them over. The troops have been supplied by the "class beef of the County" but that is now exhausted—Northampton has sent none, because it was by order, carried on board the French Fleet. Concludes, "The People here are much suprised at the return of Mr. Lion, as he has taken the Pulpit again, without Satisfying the Publick, by whos Authority he came here." Ed: Eandolph, "in behalf of the Yirginia Delegation," to Gov: February 1st Harrison. "Sir The post of the present week having failed to arrive in this city on Philadelphia its usual day (Tuesday) and our letters not coming to hand until this morning (Friday) we can answer your Excellency's favor of the 17th instant, only by acknowledging the receipt of it. We have the hon'r Sir, to be with great respect yr: Excellencys mo: ob: Servts." Col: George Mathews to Col: Davies. February 1st His letter of the 19th January, also one from Genl: Greene of the 27th An^taCo. December last, are just received—It gives him great pain that he can-' ^^g^,, not comply immediately with Gen 1: Greene's orders,—Since he left Ches- terfield last spring he has been "with care and rigid economy endaver- ing to presarve from rail want a wife and Eight helpiis children" left in easy circumstances when he went into the service. Last summer he was attacked "with the appearence of a fistilo which have sence termi- 7

He has written to Genl: Greene to expect him in April next if his health will permit; in the mean time Col: Posey whose ability will amply repay his absence and be agreeable to Genl: Greene, will march with the Troops. Concludes, "nothing but a desire to Justify my self to a man I esteem my rail friend for not marching immediately, could have drawn from me so teadious relation of family afears which I know will give you pein." February 1st 1ST. B. BuRWELL Co. LlETTT., TO COL. DAVIES. James City He has not been able to make the returns required by his letter of Oo* the 25th Sept: 1781, on account of the confused State of affairs in that County and his long absence from home. He regrets to find upon investigation, that "most all our recruits have absconded,* owing in a great measure to the following circumstance "our draft took place on Tuesday the 17th of April last, & on Friday in the same week Gen'ls Philips & Arnold entered Williamsburg & York & carried off with them some of the recruits & others of them through choice joined the British." The cloathing required have been delivered—A "strict enquiry shall be made after the recruits that have absconded." February 2d ^AJ: ^- CLAIBORNE* TO COL: DAVIES. Fredericks- Eequesting him to procure and send to him his Commission "properly burg filled up." He thinks he "cannot be far from a Captain Lieutenancy." February 2d CoL: DAVIES TO THE GOVERNOR— War Office Drawing attention to the condition of the "Public Works at Warwick." Little or nothing is done there at present, and yet there are "ten hands kept there" belonging to the State, who could be hired out to advantage, most of them are Kope-Makers, but as the Public rope-walk is burnt, the proprietors of the private rope-walks near Eichmond are very anxious to hire these negroes and will give high wages for them. Capt: Young informs him also, there are several houses in town, belonging to the Public, either unoccupied or used by persons who have no right to them. They might be rented out to advantage—Desires instructions on these two subjects. *His rank as Major, was in the Continental Q. M. Department; but was an officer also in the Artillery of the Va.

Eobert Smyth, Surgeon Gloucester & Director of British Hospitals in Virginia, having received intelligence that some medicines, sometime since forwarded from Gloucester, for the use of the British Prisoners in Cantonments, have been lost, the want of which throws them into great Distress—Your memorialist having been asked for a fresh supply to be forward, hopes your Excellency and Council will Order such conveyance for the medicines for each Eegiment, as you may think necessary for the relief of the British Prisoners—" —also, inclosing copy of letter from John Story, acting purveyor at Gloucester to Dr. Eob't Smyth &c—as follows— "Sir Notwithstanding repeated & pressing Applications have been made to the American Commissaries for a regular supply of Provisions for the Sick in the British Hospital at this Place, yet it has produced noth- ing but promises— For the last month they have not furnished us with any thing, and I have reason, to believe it will be a long time, before our necessities are attended to unless a proper representation is made—We have Subsisted by Purchase, but as there is a great difficulty in procuring money, a few days more will exhaust our Resourses, I have informed you of these cir- cumstances that your superior Judgement might point out what is necessary— I have the honor to be your humble Servant." Jno. Robertson, Sup: Com: Issues, State of Va. to the Governor. February 3d Enclosing "General Return" of all Provisions received by him and his Richmond Assistants from this State "for Continental use, in the last year" except- ing those rec'd at the different Ports by the ass: Deputy Q. master, who make their returns to Maj: Fosyth.—A copy of those latter shall be gotten, when a full return can be forwarded to his Excellency. Begs to be advised how he is to procure "a necessary supply of wood and forage from the continent." It is impossible he can continue his Office in Richmond, unless he can get "something to live upon."—He has not drawn a stick of wood or "one grain of Forage" since he left York the 17th December last, but pays ready money for both. He does not wish to leave the place, without the permission of the Executive, but it

Concludes "I hope you will pardon my presumption in troubling you with this affair, as it don't in the least concern you, but the former Eepeated testimonies of your friendship always induces me to apply to you when in distress. February4th Col: Davies informs the Governor of the irregular conduct of the War Office people in taking up and slaughtering cattle belonging to the Govern- ment.

The Clothier General, being about to send fo'ward one thousand additional comple Suits: Congress has ordered the Commissioners, appointed to settle the accounts of the U.

"Sir Dumfries Your favor of the 18th ult: covering an extract of a Letter from Col: Hendricks, came to hand a few days ago— When the French Troops came to the Southward, I was in Philadel- phia, & before I got home, part of them had passed this place. I was informed that Mr. Conn was furnishing the whole of them with our Specific Tax Corn, drawing from them cash at 10. S. pr: Bl: And that he was supplying them also with Hay, that had been impressed from the Gentlemen in the neighborhood for the use of the Continental Army. I stept over to Mr. McDaniel's where Mr. Conn Lodged to tell him that he ought in my opinion to return the money rec'd for the Corn, into the Treasury & that the people who he rec'd the Hay from
Page 53
CALENDAE op state papbes. 63 ought to have the money arising from it, but he was gone to Alexandria, 1782. & tho' he was from time to time in Town for ab't two or three weeks February 5th after this, I did not see him. I did not know his person, but in the meantime Mr. McDaniel had told me he was taking up the cash he rec'd from time to time, to Col: Hendricks. I made no doubt but the Col: had particular directions regarding the disbursement of the money, and therefore gave myself no further trouble about the matter. Only when I made the return of our Specific Tax, I thought it necessary to note that a quantity of the Corn had been delivered to the French. Since the receipt of your Letter, I have made particular enquiry into the matter, and notwithstanding Mr. Conn's return of only Three Ton of Hay & nineteen bushells of Corn, he has, from the best information I can obtain, furnished the French Troops & rec'd the money for upwards of Twenty Ton of Hay & eight hundred or a thousand bushells of Corn, for which I cannot find that he ever replaced one pound of Hay or a single bushell of Com at this post. Mr. McDaniel tells me that Conn set out three different times from his House, with large sums of money, which he told him he was taking up to Col: Hendricks—And that he has seen him receive at one time upwards of one hundred Guineas from the French, & he was receiving almost every day for three or four weeks. One Gentleman, Mr. Gwadkins, had Twelve Ton of Hay taken from him and Sold to the French. Conn rec'd the money in the presence of Mr. Gwadkins, but would not pay him one Shilling of it—Every Drove of French beeves was fed here with Corn & hay or both. The American Beeves were furnished with neither. A Court of Enquiry may bring all these matters to light. Conn has certainly inposed upon Col: Hen- dricks most grosly—but I think the Col: is mistaken in some of his observations. "That if the grain was replaced, there could be no harm done & that if the peoples' goods were once taken from them & got into the Agent's hands, as they never could go back to them, it could make no difference who consumed them"—in the first case as the corn was sold at 10. S. pr: Bl: to the French & could be spared, the money ought to have been sent to the Treasury—because if more corn had been wanted at this post, it could be laid in again at a dollar pr: Bl. Mr Conn could have no right to make 60 pr Ct: by trading with the Country's property, in the Second, The people conceived, and indeed knew, that one third or one fourth of the Hay impressed for this Post would have served the Continental Troops. & that they could have sold the remaining two thirds or three fourths to the French, themselves for cash, therefore the People have no doubt, just cause of complaint. I have the honor to be with the greatest regard, Dear Sir, your most obedt Sevnt."

February 6th Chatham In reply to his, requesting information in regard to the Counties that JaCo6untyty kave failed to furnish "the district Beeves"—As they were to have been delivered when Mr. Browne was in office, he knows little about the matter except that his own County had supplied some—New Kent and Charles City had given "not a single beef"—Indeed so few- counties have furnished their full quota, that were they collected, Genl: Green's Army might be fed for some months. It gives him great concern that Genl: Green is in such need of provisions, and alltho' he considers him- self out of office, and if the condition of his family will allow it, he will be in Eichmond by the 15th Feb'y and will perform any service required of him.

MASTER TO GOV: HARRISON. Manchester The Continental horses are starving; they have been supported for the last ten days on what forage he "could purchase for two old Conti- nental waggons sold for that article." The only mode of supplying them, will be by collecting the grain, the inhabitants of the adjacent counties have to pay "for each poll." By a letter reed: from Mr. Eonald of Powhatan, he finds there will be no chance of collecting anything in that part of the Country, in as much as the wants of five or six hundred Starving men at Cumberland old Ct. House, have consumed all the people can spare. Mr. Eonald recommends however, that the Law of the last Session of the Assembly "laying a tax of half a Bushel of Wheat or one Bushel of Corn pr: poll" passed at the urgent request of Colo. Carrington, may yield a large quantity of forage, should the Gov: & Council issue an order for its immediate execution, especially as it was the intention of the Legis- lature, by this act, to supply the Quarter master's Department. He therefore recommends this step; but if this plan should fail, Mr. Eonald

Capt: Edmund Eead, V. L. Dragoons to Gov: Harrison. February7th In accordance with the Orders of november last, he, as soon as the Bedford Co. men had recovered from the Small pox at Winchester, had marched the New London Corps to this place, where he arrived two days before. He found no supplies of any sort for the men or horses laid up, and but for the aid of "some of the principal gentlemen" in the county they should have starved. Begs that orders, be given to the Commissioners of the Counties, as soon as they are appointed, to collect the grain. Unless this is done or some other aid given, his men must be disbanded. Their "extreme nakedness and want of accoutrements" make it impossible for them to take the field if called upon. He again appeals to his Excellency for aid, being "without one Shilling to purchis necessarys for the Coar or no power to Impress"—also enclosed, «a letter from Capt: Eead to Col Davies, repeating the substance of the above, but adding "I'm inf'd there is some Bugel Horns, stored with the Q. M. taken at York, we are much in want of them for the use of the Coar, please give an order for them to the Dragoon &c." Col: Christian Febiger to Gov: Harrison. February7th "Sir being well convinc'd that in the present distracted state of our pub- lic Affairs, your Excellency's whole Attention must be taken up in pub- lick Business, has induced me hitherto to make my several Applications to Government through the Commissioner of War, and have to return my Thanks to your Excellency for your attention to the Distresses of the troops. As soon as a few stores which Col: Posey has procured in Eichmond arrive here, the Detachment now here will march to join General Greene." He is requested by the Officers at the Station, or of the Line, to ask his Excellency to appoint some one to proceed to Philadelphia to pro- cure "Copys of the different Pay, and other Accounts of the Officers," it being impossible for them to make a final settlement with the Audi- tors, as required by Act of the last Assembly, without them. For want of money and other reasons, they cannot procure them themselves. Some Officer of the Line would be the proper person, and he recommends therefore Capt: Mayo Carrington of the 5th Ya. Rgt: now a prisoner on parole as a fit person, unless it be inconsistent with his duty. As soon as the Detachment has marched, he will foward a full return of its strength &c.

The articles taken embraced all her household furniture including feather beds, rug, cotton, wool, Dutch-oven, pewter plates, Scales, Grid- Iron, spinning wheel, Iron Pot-racks, flag chairs, Iron Hominy Pestle, candle mould, narrow Ax, Hour-Glass &c &c—amounting in value, to £21. 10s. 3d. allowed by the Count de Eochambeau. Mr. Digges has at last collected almost all the accounts from Individ- uals, of damages done by the French and .Continental troops, and will in a few days, with the "French Intendant" enter upon their examina- tion. The extreme ignorance of the people in regard to their losses will prevent their getting satisfaction; tho' they are better*off than the holders of certificates who are put off by the French, under the false impression that his duty will require of him the settlement or payment of them.

They are so confused, and intermingled with others, that the difficulty of stating them correctly is almost inexpressible. He had made this report to the Hon: Messrs Jamerson and Ambler, in his answer to the order of the Council when Genl: Nelson was Governor. But he will undertake to perform the duty, especially as he knows that the Auditors being strangers to the transactions with "the most Expert Clerk," would meet with insurmountable difficulties. He will be in Eichmond as soon as his son recovers from the Small pox, and endeavor to give the Coun- cil the requisite information.

I never saw the man, but have inform myself of his former character as well as of his conduct since his resig- nation to the Laws of his Country, which in both cases have been uni- form and good. And altho' he is condemn'd in his County for a further trial, his crimes are only similar to those men in Augusta county who opposed the laws and prevented the draught, except his being a leading man in the Section. I can truly say this is the first time I ever spoke in favour of a Tory, or ever wished their lives spared them—but Humanity as well as policy urges me to say something in favour of Clapool, and wish he may obtain forgiveness. In the first place he has a wife and fourteen children chiefly small, and dependent on him for subsistence. In the next place I think he may be depended on, and sure to prevent another revolt, which the people of that place for many years will incline to, as they are ignorant of their duty, fond of changes and withal encouraged & favoured by the situation of the place They live in, which is composed of deep valies and inaccessible mountains, which serves to favour their escape when pursued, in the third place his being forgiven would be a means of bringing in numbers of out Lyers, who are afraid to come, for fear of being punished—numbers of deserters from the Army with them. I have the Honor to be your obt. & hbl Servt Feb'y llth Col: James Innis to Gov: Harrison. "Sir, Kichmond During the late Campaign in this State, while the british Army was in possession of Williamsburg I was sollicited by the Major-General Marquis La Fayette, on acc't of my acquaintance with the Inhabitants of that City and its vicinage, to use my efforts to establish a line of Intelligence with the british Army, both on the North and South sides of York Eiver. To enable me to Effectuate This object with the more certainty, the Marquis directed me to promise a premium of ten guineas to those persons, whom I might employ, provided they could give indubitable proofs of their having been in the british Encampment, and greater rewards, should they bring material Information. I was happy enough to make such arrangements as answered the General's wishes. The persons whom I engaged as Intelligencers on the South side of York Eiver were, I have been told, compensated by the Marquis for their toils and Hazards. But those on the Gloster side, from whom very material service were derived, having no access to the "Marquis, demand of me a performance of my promises—to which as the Marquis has now left the Continent, I shall be compelled, unless yr: Excellency may suppose that I ought to be releived by the Interference of the State. The sum for which I stand liable, does not exceed twenty five 1782. Feb'y 10th

On this account he had made every possible exertion—had under instructions from Col: Banister bor- rowed large amounts.—These are now due, on this account eight hun- dred bushels of corn, for want of which the lenders are this moment suffering greatly, and he prays for an Order from the Executive, to enable him to replace it. In addition to this he desires to receive his pay for extra services arranged—From September, he supplied from that County "368 Beeves, 145798 pounds four 21100- lbs. of bread, 7364 Bushels of Corn, 826 Bush: Oats, 635 lb Bacon, 3712 gallons 382 bushels Salt, & 20324 lbs Seconds" chiefly at the most critical time, as Mr. Pierce can testify—He was also Mr. Pierce's assistant in Amelia & Prince George Cos. and indeed used every exertion in his power to , procure supplies for the army, knowing that a failure in this respect would be fatal in its consequences. Lastly he was directed by the Com'r of War under order of Council, to collect all estray horses and Cattle left by the British &c, and he sent to Capt: Young at Richmond, about sixty horses, some of which were very valuable. Under these circum- stances he trusts such allowance may be made, as will reward him for his Services. Robert Porterfield encloses to the Governor "various Certificates" of Feb'y nth money due the estate of his deceased brother the late Lieut: Col: Charles Henrico Co. Poterfield, requesting his Excellency to inform him how they are to be settled. Begs leave to mention also, that previous to his brother's death and while he was a prisoner at Camden, "considerable sums of money" were advanced to him by gentlemen, for which he is now responsible, and he therefore requests, that in order to enable him to pay these amounts, a "Certificate for pay," due his brother's Estate, as an officer, may be issued, similar to those granted to officers allowing two years pay, under a late Act of assembly.

Finding it impossible to recruit any more men into the State Legion, raised by authority of the Assembly, in March 1781, unless the bounty is paid up, he has ordered the Commanders of the several corps to "ren- dezvous their Eecruits" in Eichmond on the 20th April, when their ser- vice begins. From the returns of the 1st Legion, it consists of "270 Infantry & 16 Cavalry." He has had no official return from Col: Mead, in regard to the strength of his Corps, but from verbal reports of the Officers, they have between three and four hundred. He gives this in- formation, in order that provisions may be supplied for them. Feb'y 12th John Harmanson to Col: Davies. Northamp- The Yolunteer Troop of the County has been of great expence to the ton Co. people on account of the rapid depreciation of the paper money, and those who have boarded them must lose greatly thereby unless their acc't be allowed to be paid out of the Specific Taxes, at specie rates. The cost of the gun-powder used may appear great, but "when I inform you it was necessary to keep 2 cannon at the Court house (the center of the County) for the purpose of alarming the Inhabit's to join the Troop upon the approach of the Enemy, which happen'd alm'st daily) it will not be thought surprising, even had they have used more."

Such Conduct in our young men merits public applause. I therefore could wish they cou'd be allowed the accustomary pay & Eations and be exempt from future Draughts.

Duty as a member of the Federal Union, and interest as more intimately involved in the fate of the Southern States, cannot fail to operate as powerful incentives to Yirginia, to use .every means in her power to recruit her Continental line and afford every other reasonable support to the Southern Army, As we are unac- quainted with the supplies of Beef furnished by the State upon former requisitions, we are at a loss to know how far it would be necessary to ascertain the terms of the supply now called for, to enable the State to charge it in acct. with the United States, in part of the quota of the present year." ****** The success "The Chev: Luzerne has received intelligence from the W.

At present the public Store is almost destitute of every necessary supply for the army, without even a pros- pect of being replenished from any quarter that I know of. the expense to the State, of keeping up such an establishment is very considerable & perhaps affords but little conveniency, as there are Clothiers & subr clothiers besides, to whom the materials for clothing the Army, should

I find by another Act of assembly that the Accts of all officers of the Virginia Line are imme- diately, finally, to be settled by the Auditors, in which all the clothing supplied them during the war by the State, is to be accounted for: it is extremely necessary therefore that a Collection of all issues made by myself or Others should be made in order to Enable the Auditors to ex- hibit proper Accounts against the Officers who apply to settle, this is a business which will require very particular attention, together with the variety of business which has fallen to my share for some years past & is equally necessary should be fully settled: to "do which some addi- tional leisure & opportunity is requisite, for these reasons it is, that I have taken this liberty (which I hope your Excellency will pardon) of submitting to your Excellency's better determination, whether the dis- continuance of a Commissary of Stores for the State, is not at present necessary. I have the honor of being with great deference, Your Excellency's Most obedt. Servant" Maj: E. Claiborne to Gov: Harrison. Feb'y 16th Enclosing several extracts of a letter received from the Quarter Fredericks- Master General, upon the subject of supplies &c, and enquiring what ^urg Va effect they will have in raising them. The letter is dated at New Windsor, and says "It is true you have represented the distressed situa- tion of the Department in your district, and it is true that it has never been in my power to assist you. It is also true (as I have told you) that the distresses of Virginia and the public officers therein are by no means Singular. Divers States have suffered as well as Yirginia by the ravages of the Enemy, and some much more. In these some of the public Creditors pointedly complain & talk of seizing the public property, or commencing suits against the public officers. I was myself threatened with such a suit since my return from Yirginia. Yet in general there appears among the people (and in this State in particular you will hardly meet a man to whom the public is not two or three years in arrears for Services and supplies) much less impatience than your letter indicates to be discovered by the inhabitants of Yirginia. That your Government too should complain (as you suggest) is to me a matter of astonishment. Good God! from what sources are public monies to be derived? Is it imagined that the financier has the power of Creation? that the appointment of that officer was to rid the State of all further trouble & expence? that it was to receive monies from, instead of sup- plying the public treasury?

64 CALENDAE OF STATE PAPEES. 1782. Compared with our immence expenses, of what moment is the pittance Feb'j 16th of hard money received from France? And what will suffice to defray these expenses, but heavy taxes promptly levied & faithfully collected by the Several States? Yet how Slack are all the Governments in levy- ing & enforcing the collection of the public taxes. I am this day informed by a letter from Philadelphia that (Pennsylvania excepted) the Financier has received no aid of cash from any State in the Union!" You are rightly informed (I myself mentioned it to you) that prompt paiments are made for some services & supplies in Pennsylvania and other States at the northward; but the monies or Government securi- ties requisite for this purpose have been furnished by the individual States, when such payments have been made, Pennsylvania excepted, which has (as I understand,) committed to Mr. Morris the direction of its finances. But the monies thus furnished by individual States have been very inadequate to the paiment of the debts contracted by my Deputies, all of whom are largely in arrears. Knowing how very little money came into the Continental Treasury, I have not expected to sup- ply Deputies from thence, but that the individual States would generally furnish the means of supplying the business of the department within them respectively. How could I expect it, when I have been so ill sup- plied myself, that for some months together, I have not had public money enough to send off an Express. Even if the money promptly paid in Pennsylvania a very large proportion was expended in the pur- chase & transportation of Stores for the Southern Service." "After describing your other embarrassments, you ask me to advise you in what manner to proceed—If Sir, your Government is determined no longer to yield its Aid for the support of the Public business in the* State, the consequence is very obvious—it must fail, and the Quarter masters Department then be disolved: for I cannot encourage you to expect relief from the Continental Treasury. The evils you describe, and seem to think peculiar to your State, exist everywhere; except that of the Government's refusing to yield any assistance to enable the public Officers acting within its own limits to accomplish the most essential duties required of them—you indeed. appear suspicious that I am insensible to your distresses, notwithstanding your repeated representations of them: but Sir, the suspicion is inju- rious. It has never been possible to obtain from the public Treasury the means of relieving you. The business of my department at all the Posts in this State (New York) and in Jersey, when the Enemy has been there, has been effected almost wholly by persuation & impresses. The monies that have been paid for such extensive services and supplies are comparatively but as the9 dust of the ballance: nor have I now the least prospect of paying for them. The scantiness of the public funds render it impossible for the financier to look back; if he shall struggle through current difficulties he will deserve great applause: but this he

Feb'y 16th "Sir The Frontier situation of this County has hitherto made it neces- Greenbrier sary to keep some men imbodyed to oppose the Indians during the County summer Season, which is now approaching, and the people begin to grow apprehensive of Danger. Should you think proper to admit of the usual gard for the Insuing Season, I would be glad of your approba- tion to post some at Elk Eiver on the Kenaway, as they will more effectually cover the frontier of this County at that place, than they can posably do at the former posts, as it lys at the Distance of eighty miles from this place & Eight in the Eoad of the Indians. 1 am satisfied twenty men will Eender more service there, than fifty has formerly done at different posts in the Internal parts; and with less expence.

Kichmond The Assembly at its last session having ordered the dismission of all Quarter masters and Commissaries, he has been expecting his discharge by the Council, from whom he derived his appointment of "Commissary of Stores." At present the Public Store is "almost ^destitute of every necessary Supply for the Army," and he sees therefore no reason why the State should be put to the expense of keeping it up. The Clothiers can as well attend to this business. In addition to this, all the accounts of the Officers of the Virginia Line are to be "finally settled by the Auditors." In this, all the Clothing issued by himself and others during the war must be accounted for, in order that the Auditors may exhibit proper accounts against those Officers who apply for a settlement. Under these circumstances he takes the liberty to suggest that his Office be at once discontinued, so that he may have time to give attention to the settlement of his accounts, running through so many years, and em- bracing such varity of business as has fallen to his lot— Feb'y 17th ^M.

The repeated disappointments I have met with from Government Quarters occasion me to Enter on the business you propose with some Regret, MHouse S sna^ aside every Reflection and commence anew. But in what manner to conduct myself I am Realy at a loss to determine, without either money or credit. And the sailable public property I have on hand such, that I cannot spare without a probability of geting it Re- placed, which I do not yet discover. We are Reduced to the necessity of a defensive war, and wish to be able to Repel those I expect we shall have to contend with. If we are fortunate this spring, a Small Rein- forcement and a few supplies may Enable us perhaps to turn the scale on them after harvest—The Post of Licking will be Immediately Estab- lish'd, and the others as soon as circumstances will admit—The plan of Gun-Boats is Excellent. They may be built, But cannot be put in motion until we Receive Cannon Riging &c. I have wrote to Col: Davis (Davies) on the subject, and think they may Come to hand early in the spring. Pray give me all the Immediate assistance in your power. Hostilities have already commenced, and I wish the predictions in my last to you, may not come to pass. This year you may Rely on it that Every Exertion will be made, and hope such as will answer the purpose, but our Circumstances at present are such that its Impossible to give a Just Idea of what will be done. By a continual correspondence with some nations of the Oubash Indians, and from them to others, circula- ting such Intelligence through them, we thought most advisable to keep the whole silent until lately. But I doubt no attempts for the future will be of any service. The Garrison of St. Vincent is Evacuated, except a few spys, Residing at that post, Kaskaskas, Cohas &c, for the purpose of Intelligence, perhaps they ma}T answer a good purpose, as I learn Ham- ilton & Connely is at Detroit, and make no doubt but they will attempt something of Importance. Colo: Davis (Davies) flaters me with the hopes of all the State Infantry. I don't think they could be beter em- ploy'd than in this Departm't. I am satisfy'd concerning the Verbal message alluded to in yours, finding that it was aimed at me. I wish those who see the Resolution may not think so, as its known that most publick transactions in the Western Departm't pas'd thro' my hands. Such an idea must be pain- ful to me well knowing the Exertions I have us'd to save the publick monies. Abuses have taken place. And I ardently wish for the arrival of Auditors to adjust the accounts. It may be of great advantage to us in our future operations. Examples are much wanting—which would have taken place before this time had I not put the Construction I did on the Resolution. What hurt me was the idea I had of its being so pointed. Not but what I think it the duty of government to call all

Your assurities of the publick Creditors having Justice has given Infinite Satisfaction to many, but I doubt will hardly Eaise the publick Credit. If I knew it would be agreeable to you, I could get a considerable sum of money from Orleans by sending flower to that post, which sell for an uncommon price. Such a step is in contemplation. In short, confidant that any measures aim'd for the publick good will meet with your approbation when Judiciously plan'd, I shall make such my study, hoping frequently to Eeceive Instructions from you, and such assistance as in your power.

My men's feet being very sore, I intend making a halt here until to-morrow twelve or one o'clock, which will be a means.of healing their feet a little and haveing their cloaths washed. What would you think if I was to tell you that not a man has deserted me since I set out from Prince Edward Court House; how- ever, the industry and vigilence of the officers is so strictly adhered to by them, that I think it almost sufficient to prevent any Set of men from desertion, except some of the grandest rascals in the world! and I beleive we have a few of that kind too.

I wish some plan could be adopted for the Draft to take place in all or as many Counties as possible at once and the same time." ****** "The men that drops in now and then are naked in the literal Sense of the word, and I have nothing to give them nor any visible Prospects, untill Supplies can be brought from the Southward—neither shall I be able to feed many more, unless other Measures are taken to supply the Post, than are now in Force. Was it not for the few Specifics we gett, the men must starve. The Continental Commissaries have nothing for us, neither do I know how the State would pay the Bountys stipulated in said Law." ****** "The Route for Expresses to go to the Southward is altered—the Express goes now from Manchester to this place, from hence to Prince Edward Courthouse, from thence by Charlotte Court House to Coles Ferry, from thence to Peytonsburg—of this I thought it necessary to inform you as it will much facilitate my communications with Govern- ment—the Post at Carters Ferry was of so little use to me that I could not oppose its being broke up, and with a waggon I would much rather go from here through Richmond to Fredericksburgh, than through Goochland, Louisa and Spotsylvania on account of the Badness of the Koads." * * * * * * "If you have any news, pray write me, for I am extreamly dull and lonesome. jNTo body but my little Girl & two or three officers, as dull as myself—the french pester'd me amazingly, but went off highly pleas'd they received my Barracks &c, clean, neat & in good order, my house as clean and neat as it could be made.

Feb'y 23d The march of the French Troops has been the cause of his not reply- Cumberland ing to his of the 11th inst. He is extremely sorry, a person cannot be Old Ct: sent to Philadelphia by the State to procure "the Accounts of the Vir- ginia Line, and fears no one there will do it as well as an officer of the Line. The Detachment under Lt: Col: Posey marched on the 14th inst: the men leaving with considerable reluctance, for want of money and clothing; the latter of "exceeding bad Quality especially the 10

Linnen over-alls" He observes in the Gazette an "Order of Govern- Feb'y 23d ment" for executing the Draft Law in the delinquent Counties, a few Substitutes have been brought in, and some men raised by individuals under an "Act pass'd the last session of assembly." From the irregular way in which this draft is managed, men are brought in without a single article of clothing or other necessarys to supply them with." The con- sequence is they are detained until those articles can be gotten "a use- less and burthensome Expence to the Country." Thus for want of pro- visions being now hardly able to supply a few sick, convalescents and Invalids, ("with the Artificers & waggoners necessary at the Post") the same disagreeable consequences must follow, of which he has already had so much experience. His Excellency therefore must understand how impossible it will be for him to equip another Detach- ment, until money, wagons, tents, all kinds of Q. master Stores, camp equipage, clothing, arms, accoutrements ammunition and other mil: Stores are "laid in"—In as much as Col: Davies has informed him "that all supplies for the future are to come from the Continent," unless they can be procured in Richmond they must "come from the northward"— He knows not what to do for provisions, unless the Post is supplied by contract; the adjacent counties altho' ordered, scarcely affording any supplies. He has already written to the Commander in chief and is now preparing despatches for the minister of war, enclosing "Estimates for the equipment of 1200 men," which he supposes will be as many as the State can raise this summer. Desires to be supplied with such acts of the Assembly as are in force "concerning the Army"—also the Governor's opinion as to the resources of the State in supplies and men. From a Beturn rec'd from Major Poulson, on the Eastern Shore, he has raised "93 men" and thinks he can complete two companies. He will delay his dispatches for the Minister of War in Phil: until replies from his Excellency shall have been received, in order to "lay more perfect accounts" before that Officer.

Feb'y 25th "Sir The Cannon* in Pamunkey were those which I had brought up War Office from York and Cumberland, and were overtaken by the enemy at Taylor's Ferry and thrown into the river. Every endeavor has already been exerted to raise them, before the winter floods, but we could not accomplish it, we were therefore obliged to wait until the waters fall again, which will not be low enough for the purpose before the summer. * These are doubtless the long bronze French pieces referred to by Tarlton in his "Campaigns in Virginia," six of which were afterwards brought to Kichmond, and remained on the public Square until the State Army was completed, when they were placed upon the parade ground within the buildings. There may have been some iron guns also thrown into the Pamunkey river by Tarlton. Those referred to in the letter above are still at the bottom of the Pamunkey, and are of like character and value with the two now to be seen at the Ya. Military Institute, which survived the troubles and demands of the late war between the States; the other four having been melted and re-cast into modern guns. They are long seige-pieces, decorated with mottoes and devices, and are of great value.

Feb'y 25th Jas: Madison Jnr: Edm'd Eandolph Jos: Jones, and A. Lee, Dele- gates, to Gov: Harrison. "Sir Philadelphia We have your Excellency's favor of the 9th of this month. Since our last the plan for the final settlement of the public accounts from the Commencement of the war to the 1st Jan'y, 1782, which we formerly mentioned to be under consideration, has been adjusted and agreed to by Congress, and will be fully explained to your Excellency, by the Superintendent of finance, to whose department it properly belongs—the want of the rule prescribed by the articles of Confederation, and which, from the particular situation of some of the States, could not now be obtained rendered the adoption of any mode, very difficult, the one pro- posed, when the variety of circumstances and interests to be combined upon the occasion are considered, will perhaps be found as free from exceptions as any that could be devised, and will, it is to be hoped, meet the approbation of the States. We have reason to beleive it has not proceeded from partiality to the Eastern and middle States, that contracts for the Southern department have not been proposed, as previous to the receipt of your Letter we had shown attention to this business, and found the Financier disposed to take that course for supplying the Southern Department so soon as taxes were laid, and likely to be collected in those States to enable him to comply with such engagements as he should enter into for that pur- pose. If any preference appears to have been given to the State of Pennsylvania in the benefit of contracts, we are assured it has pro- ceeded from the money supplied by that State to enable the Superin- tendent of Finance to fulfil them. This money was supplied in commuta- tion for the specific requisitions due to the United States. It may with truth be said, that the States as Virg'a, which supplied the Specifics, did their duty as much as Pennsylvania w'ch commuted for money, but un- happily the latter mode only has put into the hands of the superinten- dent the means of fullfiling future contracts, we must beg leave to refer to the inclosed papers for the news, and are very respectfully, Sr. yr.

Has postponed Caroline Co. action until further instructions can be received. By the Act of Assembly a bounty of four thousand dollars pr: recruit is to be paid. As there is now no paper money, he desires to know how this point is to be settled. The men are expected to serve eighteen months from the day of drafting. In as much as this had been postponed by order of Council because the militia were so constantly on duty, he submits that it will now be very unjust to require these men to serve their full term, unless every man who has already been in active service be credited with that service "to be deducted from the 18 months." In addition to this, many have enlisted in the Legion, and many are sick, and unfit for active duty, so that his Excellency must not be disappointed at results, if the draft is enforced. He expresses the hope that this course on his part may not be con- strued by the Executive as "a desire to gain popularity" in his County, such motives being unworthy of him, but as Commanding Officer, he is equally bound to do justice "to his Country & People.. He awaits the reply of the Governor, to whose orders he shall give a "most chearfuli compliance." Eobert Morris to Gov: Harrison. Feb'y 26th "Sir I have been honored wit'h^ybur Excellency's Letter of the Seventh Office of Instant. Your strictures on the Conduct of Congress would be x>hTud-Iphia unnoticed, did they not derive a consequence from the Character you Sustain. You will permit me to observe, that the Honorable Delegates of Virginia are guardians of its Rights; and that the Congress composed of such Delegates from all the States, are competent to determined on matters which relate to the general interest. Permit me Sir, also to observe, that if measures adopted by Congress were really oppressive to a particular State, the Government ought to make an early Representa- tion on the subject. I enclose the Extract of a Letter from his Excellency Governor Jefferson to the President of Congress, dated the twenty Seventh of July 1780, which does by no means either assert or imply that the Requisition for Tobacco would be inconvenient, much less oppressive. Your Legislature have not remonstrated against it, and I persuade myself that If they should make such Remonstrance, it will be in proper terms. A regard for their own Dignity will prevent them from charging the Sovereign Representative of America with Ignorance and Oppression. As your Excellency informs me that the Executive of your State cannot interfere in the transaction with Mr. Ross, I shall not trouble you or them with any thing further on the Subject, and as

The honorable Delegates of Virginia have communicated a Part of your Letter to them. The polite manner in which they have conducted all the Business we have transacted together, commands my esteem and Confidence. Your Excellency may depend that I Shall always endeavor to do my Duty, but as some men are influenced more by Passion than reflection, Prudence would dictate a little caution on the score of Insinu- ations. It is possible that Sentiment might speak the Same Language with Prudence, but at any Eate, it would not be amiss to know the State of Facts, before we institute a charge of Partiality. I have the Honor to be with perfect respect, Your Excellency's most obedient & Humble Servant. Extract referred to above. "A Specific Tax in Tobacco is payable on the 31st Day of December next. Of this about 3725 Hogsheads were appropriated as a Fund whereon to borrow money, under the Calls of Congress of Oct. 6 and 7, 1779, but another Provision for this Call being made, these Tobaccoes ^remain unappropriated, and of course free to be applied by the Assembly Recording to the Eequisitions of February 25. They will have brought in, under the same Specific Tax, as much as would make up the Eesidue required.

Kobert Morris to the Governor of Virginia. Feb'y 28th "Sir I do myself the Honor to transmit to your Excellency, the inclosed Office Act of the United States, in Congress of the thirteenth Instant—I am of Finance to request that the Cattle mentioned in General Greene's Letter, be fowarded as speedily as possible, and as I persuade myself that a consider- able Ballance is due from the State of Virginia on the Requisitions for Specific Supplies, the Cattle which may be furnished shall be carried to Call upon Account on those Requisitions. But if Contrary to my Expectations, it ^pp"1^ t^r should appear that they have been fully complied with, or if they have Gen'l Greene been so nearly complied with, as that the Cattle asked for, by General Greene, shall, in addition to the other articles furnished, exceed the whole amount of those Requisitions, then whatever shall remain due to the State shall be credited as the Quotas of the Current year—I flatter myself Sir, that your Excellency's zeal for the Public Service will omit no measures which may be necessary to accomplish the views of the United States, in supporting General Green, both by Aids of men and Provisions.

This step Ve conceive the only eligible mode of securing to ourselves that recompense for which the Certificates were intended, and to which we flatter ourselves, the duration and fidelity of our Services justly entitle us. I have the honor to be Sir, with the greatest respect Your Excellency's most ob serv't—■ The papers referred to, present the following facts—On the 10th Feb- ruary 1782, Brig: Genl: Chas. Scott and Col: Wm. Davies, published a printed circular, setting forth the general purpose as expressed in Col: Davies letter to the Governor, the Legislative authority, and their own reasons for having adopted this plan—They therein announce the fact, that Mr. Eoss has undertaken to manage the business for them and "generously refuses any compensation for his services." They regret the necessity which compels them to appeal to the Community for aid by subscription; but rely upon the sympathy felt for their fellow Citi- zens in the Army, who have suffered and sacrificed so much in defense of their Country, to procure for them the reward due their services— Mr. Eoss having consented to "assist them in negotiating the Certificates which they receive from the Auditors" issued to Saml: Eeall of Wil- liamsburg, Mass: Shore & McCornico, Petersburg, Hunter, Banks & Co, Eichmond, James Maury and Benj: Day, Fredericksburg, James & Adam Hunter, Falmouth, Hunter & Allison, Alexandria, Carter Braxton, West Point, and John Lyne Esqr at JSTew Castle, a circular, calling upon them to give their assistance to this object by becoming sub agents, and add- ing "The distress of many of the Officers and the present scarcity of money is such that the Certificates which these gentlemen have received for past services, will be rendered of little value, unless timely assistance is afforded by their fellow Citizens—In a short time these Certificates will be equal to the Specie, and all that is now required is a loan of Specie or Tobacco upon them, which will have an Interest of Six per cent till Paid—The Inhabitants of Eichmond and Petersburg, in two Days, Subscribed One Thousand Pounds in Specie and Tobacco, for the Certificates of a number of Officers under marching orders to join Genl: Green &c"—To this was appended a printed form of Subscription List, preceded by the following Statement: "The Officers and Soldiers of the Continental and States Lines in the pay of this Commonwealth, having been for a considerable Time, with- out receiving their Pay and Subsistance. and having suffered greatly by the Depreciation of the Paper money: the Honorable the General Assembly at their last Session, were pleased to take the matter into their Consideration, with a desire to do the most ample Justice in their power—But from the low state of our Finances, it being impossible to

Although the Funds for the Eedemption of those Certificates are thought very ample, and Estates of considerable value must in a short time be exposed to sale for that purpose, yet the situation of many of the Officers and Soldiers is such, that their wants will admit of no delay, and they are forced to make Sale of their Certificates at a very low rate for ready money, or other necessaries for their present support. To make an Article of speculation of those Certificates, and to pur- chase at an undue value, Money which has been so dearly earned, and with so much honour and advantage to the Publick, is cruel treatment to the brave Men whose services we have received. We consider the money laid out in Certificates as so much money at Interest, and that the payment of it, is as certain, as that the State will be Free and Inde- pendent: there is also the greatest reason to expect those Certificates will be taken up long before the year 1785, and it is proposed that Sub- scriptions be oi^ened in different parts of the State, in full confidence that the Public Spirited Citizens will most cheerfully advance a Sum in Specie or Tobacco, according to their circumstances, as so much lent upon the said Certificates— Wherefore, we the Subscribers do hereby engage to Pay to or his Assigns, in four Weeks from the date hereof, the Sum in Specie or Tobacco set against our Names, for the purposes before mentioned, for which the said shall furnish us or each of us with Certificates for the respective Sums subscribed, or take such other order on the matter as may be necessary.

March 5th "g jr War Office The inhabitants on the Eastern Shore of Virginia express much uneasiness at the prospect of the Continental drafts being ordered from thence. General Greene, in the last letter I received from him, directs in the most express terms, that every Continental Soldier in the State be sent on to him immediately. I have communicated the General's orders to Colo. Febiger, at the General Rendezvous, and Major Poulson who commands on the Eastern Shore; and I expect he will Soon be over with his men: tho' there is some danger that the inhabitants, will if possible seduce them to desert, and after the Officers have come over with those that are willing to follow them, the deserters will then join the volunteer Corps which they constantly keep up on that shore. Those gentlemen from thence, with whom I have conversed, say they will readily consent to the removal of the drafts, provided Government will favor them with Some of the Cavalry of the Legion. For my own part I think there cannot be much objection to their proposition, unless it be the difficulty and risk of the transportation of the men and horses. Every Article of life is cheaper there, than in any other part of the State: the men and horses can with more ease and convenience, be sup- ported there, than elsewhere, and the Same supplies that are now lavished away upon their volunteer horse, might with advantage be applied for the maintenance of one of the troops. It will be exceedingly difficult to provide for the whole legion in any of the lower Counties on this shore, and as the infantry belonging to it, will be on this side, a few Cavalry may very well answer the Common purposes of the Command, while those on the Eastern Shore would be a great protection against the plundering parties that run up into the Creeks in barges, and do a great deal of mischief, which they never were able to check, till they raised two Small Corps of volunteer horse, which are now kept up and supported with provisions by the State, but which would be discharged upon the arrival of a sufficient number of the legion cavalry. I have therefore to ask your Excellency's instructions whether a part of the legion cavalry shall be sent to the Eastern Shore—Should the proposi- tion meet your approbation, gentlemen upon that Shore will furnish the means of transportation themselves— I have the honor to be with the greatest respect Your Excellency's most obedient Servant"

There is a certain Frank Smith in Ches- morn: J x terfield, who by one stragigem or other has contrived allmost constantly to screen himself from militia Duty: at present, to avoid the draft, has by his Brother Thos. Smith, contrived to get some nonsensical appoint- ment under a Capt: Irish in the Labratory. this appointment he boasts was obtained for the purpose above: as I know the man and know he never was, or will be usefull in any business (unless that of Puting money in his Pocket can he be called usefull) and as it is injust he should avail himself on such an occasion of an exemption from what Thousands, more deserving are to submit to, I must intreat of you that he be dis- charged from his Appointment, as it is only taken by him for so bad a purpose. I beg sir, that you oblige me on this occasion, unless the Publick should suffer, and this is imppssable, as you can have none in the office he fills but will be as fit, and I believe none to be depended on than this said Mr. Smith. Your Complyance will oblige your Afft: & H'ble Servt." March 7th COL: WM. DAVIES TO THE GOVERNOR. "Sir War Office In obedience to the Order of Council, I have the honor to lay before your Excellency a return* of the military stores in the magazines of this State. The want of money has greatly retarded the collection and repair of the arms. The same difficulty still continues. In the enclosed I have not included the equipments of the Cavalry that are nearly finished at Fredericksburg, and will be sufficient for all the dragoons belonging to the State, tho' I cannot at present exactly ascertain their number, neither have I included any arms that are in possession of the militia or of the Legion. On this occasion, I beg leave to represent that mearly 1000 stand were, on various applications from Baron Steuben delivered for Continental purposes, and a promis'd given that they should be replaced. That promise however, has never yet been complied with. The arms that were taken at York, enabled the Continent now to replace them, should your Excellency think proper to direct an application to be made for them. I cannot forbear to represent further that some very valuable brass ordinance, particularly a 16-inch mortar, belonging to this State, which had been taken by the British, were recovered from them at York, but were afterward removed to the northward, by the orders of Genl: Knox. Virginia no doubt has an * Not found.

Union, in proportion to her importance she has received less and per- March 7th haps contributed more; and if we add the circumstance of this valuable ordinance having been the original property of this State, that it was here recovered from the enemy, and that her malitia alone formed a respectable proportion of the Army that took it, I believe that your Excellency will be of opinion that the State of Yirginia had a better claim to it, than any other part of the Continent, and that the pieces themselves, or other of equal value ought to be restored to us, as soon as possible. I have the honor to be, with the highest respect, Your Excellency's most obedient Servant." Capt: Thomas Hamilton to Col: Davies. March 7th He finds many of the regular Soldiers have obtained Certificates of Richmond pay from the Auditors and "are selling them for mere nothing." He has heard of one having parted with a Certificate for "£48 for £4, paid in hand." Unless some step is taken to prevent "such base advantages" the Soldiers will be ruined. The Auditors should be stopped from issuing them—He has refused to countersign many of the certificates given by the Paymasters of his Legion, to the men. Hopes his influence will be used in this matter. George Kogers Clarke to the Governor of Virginia. March 7th "Sir I wrote to you on the subject of publick affairs in this departm't, "Fort by Mr. Carny, 18th Feb'y, which I hope you have Eeceived, Since Nelson" which we have received very allarming accounts from the enemy at Detroit.

As it is probable that you may not have been informed of these Particulars, I take the Liberty of mention- ing them to your Excellency, & also of observing that it will be proper for us to set out for our respective Destinations about the middle of next month. If the horses intended for my use can be delivered to me at W'msburg, it will be more convenient for me. The Compensation proposed by the Executive, for our Services in this Business, was, exclusive of our Expences, 150 lbs of Tobac: pr: day to each, which was to be discharged according to the Hate fixed by the Grand Jury immediately preceeding the Time of Payment. This mode of Payment being abolished, I suppose your Excellency will think it proper that some other be substituted; & I flatter myself that when the nature of this Business is considered, which requires Qualifications of a particular kind & must be attended to at all Hours of the Night, as well as of the Day; which will be always fatiguing & sometimes dangerous; & which without being a Permanency will draw us far from our Eamilies & for the Time entirely suspend the Prosecution of our ordinary Business; you Sir, and the Gentlemen of the Council will be of opinion that the proposed Compensation was by no means an adequate one—Having been obliged lately to mix a good deal with Persons under the Small Pox, it will not be in my Power to wait on you previous to my setting out for Williamsburg; but I beg that I may be immediately favoured with the Determinations of the Executive relative to this matter, & am with the greatest Eespect, your Excellency's mo: Obedt. & very hble.

Parker to Governor Harrison. March ]Oth "Sir The Court of this County being ordered to make a draft of the Smithfield in Militia to fill up their quota of Soldiers for the American Army has uountyV,ght requested me to represent to your Excellency & your honourable board the distressed situation of this County during the different invasions, supposing from the active part which I have taken, and being continu- ally in the field whilst the Count}' was invested, that I should be better able to explain to your honorable board their exertions to repel the Enemy, their obedience to orders, their losses and consequent distresses, \ than any other individual; from which principle they have done me the the honor to request I would address you on the subject. Be it then known to you, that this County from the first has engaged very chearfully in the war, from the best of principles, that of supposing it a just one. When Lord Dunmore fixed his Standard at Portsmouth, and all our neighbors below were flying to it for protection, we became a barrier, and had not only the Common Enemy to encounter, but all the machinations and eviles of a Scotch faction, which at that time, in this and allmost every part of the Colony had too much weight. Indi- viduals inimical to British mandates were pointed out objects of their resentment, which for several weeks had recourse to thickets & fodder Stacks for protection, their houses not affording an asylum from the danger of those reptiles & their patron Lord Dunmore, and his black guards. The moment our County embodyed, and armed we had our Share of men ready for the established Army, and I marched with a Company of minute militia men, from this County to the Great Bridge to invest Dunmore & his gang, and assist in driving him from Norfolk and its dependencies; that you must confess from your knowledge of our situation Stretching twenty miles on James Eiver, and the nearest part of the County not as many miles from Norfolk, and dayly in Sight

The Acts of Assembly for raising the second & third sett of Conti- nentals were Completed here, not a tenth of which have returned, the Sea has swallowed many of our young men & many more has been taken on that Element & never returned. Some has gone to the back country. Those different avenues to the loss or absense of our young men renders our Situation very important—As our attachment has ever been warmed with zealous sentiments for our Cause, we must have par- ticular Enemies, hitherto we have really prevented by our exertions in the last invasion, the Enemy from lulling the whole of the lower Counties into a State of torpidity, as they could singly, had we ever been dis- persed, have rode unmolested, from Portsmouth to Petersburg, as the latter neighborhood & the County of Prince George seemed to have lost their patriotism with the skirmish at Blandford—Their different marches through this County, with the loss of our Slaves. Yessells, Stocks, and impoverishing us- by plunder and caussing us to neglect our business, added to our own Army's impressments has really injured the people so much in their property, that I conceive it would be an act of . cruelty to insist on their now making up their quota of troops, when 'we have all actually been Soldiers more than Twelve months, maintained ourselves, & did as labourious and dangerous duty as any Soldiers in the Continental Army—besides, policy would direct that as many of these militia bhould be kept at or near Portsmouth as we have, as they ever were and I am sure ever will be ready to turn out on any invasion, or in any just cause. They are now good Soldiers, the necessity of the times and the critical situation we were in last summer required severe dis- ciplain and hard duty, which w^as really practiced. I declare on my honor that when I Commanded a Eegiment in the established Army I did not enforce more, indeed it was necessary; their bearing it at a time they had a powerful Enemy in their neighbourhood insinuating into the graces of all they thought could be serviceable to them, and their not succeeding, was a convincing proof, that the people in general in this County were disposed to preserve, at the risk of their lives & propertys; they were both exposed, the last not only to the Enemy, but to our- selves; and had it only been those of our own County which were to have been fed here, our distresses would not have been so apparent, but some months we had the whole army in Virginia to feed, even without money or the idea of it, as not even the paper bubble was introduced to the people from the publick treasury. I took from the inhabitants, to

The Honourable Mr. Hardy being of this County & perfectly acquainted with our distresses can better inform your board of any other Calamity omitted by me. Therefore I should not have been so prolix, but at the unanimous & particular request of the Court, and my own feelings for the people, added to what I humbly think an act of policy in detaining the militia, when they may probably be service- able, has induced me to trouble you on the subject. I should be ungrate- full indeed, when I have my pen on the subject, if I did not mention to you essential services rendered by the Counties of Southamption & Surry, there may be some reason why they should be exempted from the draft &c. * * * * - many in Nancemond required my acknowledgements, those being nearer to Portsmouth may in some measure apologize for their not exerting themselves equally with us. Princess Anne & some part of Norfolk County have benefitted by the Enemy, but the greater part of Norfolk County have suffered. I will tire the patience of your Excellency & honourables no longer to Petition in the most fervent manner that you would suspend the Act for Draught &c. * * * and that you will cause the certificates for supplies taken by me for the troops under my command, to pass in payment of taxes, if within your power.

Several have been brought in within a few Days. I had already determined to send on the men in numbers of 75 or 80, as so many are entitled to a waggon, and from the Distance of the Stages on the Eoute, it is impossible for the men to carry their provisions on their Backs. You really frighten me, when you say I may depend on being starved. I have allready wrote General Washington fully. I shall apply to the minister of War with all possible Dispatch. But you know the Distance to Philadelphia—the Delays occasion'd by the Q. m'rs in fowarding letters appears clearly in one which I receiv'd from General Washington, sent per Express, yett it was a month old when I gott it. When my Dispatches reach the minister, so many are to be consulted, and great Bodys move so slow, that it will be some time before any sup- plies can come on from there, in the meantime if the State withdraws her Assistance, I must break up the Post & discontinue the Transaction of any Business whatever, being already very near starving at times. There appears to be some defects in the orders Government were pleas'd to issue to this and the Adjacent County Courts or Commissioners with Eespect to the Collection of the Specifics—the orders are only for Bacon— I most earnestly request you to prevail on Government to give orders for the collection of grain also, and for its Delivery to Let: Wm. Ster- ling Smith, A. D. Q. master to this Post, who is legally appointed under Col: Carrington, D. Q. M. Genl: and his Eeceipts of course valid vouch- ers to make it a Continental Charge. I will take care that nothing shall be wasted, & in Justice to Lieut: Smith, must say he keeps his Accounts in better order, and does his Duty better than any Q. M. I have had to deal with. I beg you to inform me what Countj'S are sett apart for the purpose of supplying this post, until the Financier can turn his Attention this Way. I believe they are, Amelia, Cumberland, Buckingham, Goochland & Powhatan. The People bring in their Bacon very slow & seem rather willing to pay in money. This alarms me. as if all these Countys pay in their Bacon, it will hardly last us til Forsyth will have any Thing in his power. I have wrote him often. But the answer is always the same. I have no monney nor provisions he says. I have wrote Blair and the Financier and expect daily to hear from them. We have not had a mouthfull of fresh meat since Christmas. I have upwards of 50 sick, and some in the small pox—their situation is truly deplorable, and you may guess at mine, not having a Brass farthing to support myself with, and was it not for a little sugar and coffee which Mrs. Febiger brought with her, and which is nearly exhausted, she must starve. I will send an Officer to Petersburg, but how he will subsist I know not—I sent Lt: James Morton, my Commissary on before the Detachment, it was with much Difficulty he could procure provisions

March 12th "Sir In obedience to the orders of Council, I have wrote to such of the War Office Counties as have laid off their divisions, to furnish the most speedy information of the number of beeves they have delivered and what they have on hand: and to those Counties who have not yet attended to this business, I have communicated your Excellency's orders, that they may proceed immediately to it. But this of itself will not be sufficient, unless some person is appointed in each, to receive, foward or dispose of them as he shall be from time to time directed. At present there is no one in any of the Counties, whose duty it is to attend to this, or scarcely any other Article of Specific Supply. In many places numbers of the Cattle are dead, and the remainder will die, unless some immediate regu- lation can be adopted. In some few parts of the Country indeed, the people have taken the Cattle and fattened them themselves: but most of them refuse now to deliver them up, alledging that had it not been for them they would have been dead, and that the expence of feeding them has been as much as they are worth. There is a great variety of arti- cles which have been for a long time dispers'd through the Country under the orders of Mr. Brown, which never have, and I fear never will be either reported by him or accounted for by those who have them. A great deal of grain is at this moment lying useless in the hands of Com- missioners, and great numbers of hides are lodged with different people throughout the State, of which no return has ever yet been made. I would therefore beg leave respectfully to suggest to your Excellency, the \ absolute necessity of forming some general system for the immediate collection and disposal of those stores, as well as of those Specifics which are required by the late law. If the Country was laid off into ten or twelve districts, and a person of character and abilities, appointed in each, to make enquiry into every kind of public property belonging to the Quarter Masters, Commissarys, Clothiers or Military Store depart- ments within the Districts, and report to this office, or to any other as your Excellency may think fit, it certainly would be beneficial. These persons might be authorized to demand and settle the accounts of the various Specific Commissaries and Commissioners who have never been prevailed upon yet to render them, nothwithstanding the frequent appli- cations, which I am told have been made for them. These persons might also, in their several districts, take the directions of the Specifics that are shortly to be collected. Those furnished by the northwestern Counties might be sold to the contractor for supplying the Prisoners at Frederick in Maryland. The greater part of the South western Counties might be allotted for the supply of the French Troops at Charlotte Court house. The specifics upon James Eiver above the Fork might be collected at the Point, and those immediately at and above the falls 13

After providing for the subsistence of Mr. Dick's Artificers at Fredericks- burg, the Specifics between the three northern rivers might be collected to certain convenient points upon navigation, and await your Excel- lency's further directions. From the daily complaints of want of food for our troops and artificers, and of forage for our teams, and from a conviction that they will still continue to suffer, notwithstanding the want of provision which the specific tax will raise, I have thought it my duty to make this represen- tation. Should your Excellency think any thing on my part can be done to facilitate a proper regulation of this business, I shall be happy to give every assistance, as I conceive it a matter of great and pressing impor- tance. I have the honor to be, with the greatest respect Your Excellency's obed: Ser't" March 12th Capt: Reuben Mitchell, having been a prisoner since the 1st may last, and having once been paroled by Gov: Jefferson, and after having made several ineffectual efforts to get a copy of the charges (if any) against him, begs of Gov: Harrison, that he may either be brought to trial or discharged. March 13th Col: Arthur Campbell to Col: Wm. Da vies. "Sir Washington Your letter of the 29th of Jany. reached me late in February. I sup- Co. pose you are not informed that our Southern Commander in Chief is obliged to employ part of the force of the Carolinas and Georgia against the unfriendly Southern Indians and the Tories that have taken refuge among them. To accomplish his purposes we are asked to assist, and our own immediate preservation urges us to comply. About 200 men from this county are now on the point of marching to join Colo: Isaac Shelby who commands the force destined against the Towns situated on the sources of the mobile. This enterprise will necessarily postpone our draft for Regular Soldiers, and afterwards, I am doubtful whether it can be effected at all.

March 15th The Field Officers and magistrates had held a meeting, but found the Hampton County had not been "assessed in Specie agreeable to the Act of Assem- bly, and no commissioners appointed Since 1780. The county has been in great confusion for eighteen months past; the militia composed of water-men and Pilots, and many of the Seamen now absent. The Pilots do duty in rotation on board the French ships; and in march last, in the action between Colo. Mallory and Colo. Dundas, the county lost seven men.

100 CALENDAR OF STATE PAPERS. 1782. Col: Wm. Preston to Gov: Harrison. March 15th Montgomery A letter from Col: Wm. Davies, Commissioner of the War Office County dated the 30th of January was received about the 15th Feby: making requisitions for the quota of men to be raised for the Continental Service and act of Assembly of Oct: 1780. In April 1781, he had had the County laid off, in accordance with the Law, and the "thirty eight men called for" were drafted. The Commissioners of the Tax not having the money to pay their bounties, the men were furloughed, and so the matter stood, until the receipt of the above mentioned letter. As many as had not deserted were again collected, but there being no money to pay them, they were again furloughed. He had "moved the Court" that a levy of Sufficient money, be made, but this was rejected. He has done all he could to carry out the orders under this Law, but with no avail; the men will desert before "any thing effectual can be done." Calls attention to the necessity of filling the place of Colo. Ingles, resigned on account of "his infirmities." Proper persons should also be added to the "Commissioners of the Peace," rendered necessary for keeping good order in that "frontier County to which so many dis- orderly People resort from different parts of this State, as well as the Southern States." March 16th George Wray, 1st Justice of Eliz: City Co., to the Governor. Hampton In accordance with Col: Davies Instructions a session of the Co. Court had been held with a view of executing the provisions of the Law of 1780," levying a two pr: cent, tax in Specie, and for collecting provisions, clothing &c, but that owing to the disturbed situation of the county for the past eighteen months, nothing could be done. The county had sus- tained Several difierent corps of troops "Stationed at Hampton; their Sheriff had been killed in the service, they had had no Court Since march 1780, and no Commissioner appointed. He therefore asks for Instructions as to whether this Law should now be put into execution, and awaits his reply. March 16th Col: George Skillern to Col: Wm: Davies. Botetourt The orders to recruit the quota of men for the Continental Service County are received, and the officers of the County summoned to carry them out, but he regrets to say "the business has been put completely out of his power," because of the discontent and resignation of the officers, arising out of the promotion of Mr. Ward as Lieut: Colo, over Colo. McClenahan" who has on every occasion distinguished himself as a

He is March 16th "exceedingly popular in the County" and unless commissioned as Lieut: Colo." it will be attended with very bad Consequences" in as much as the other officers, so influential with their companies will refuse to serve, thus rendering the militia of the County entirely useless. Mr. Ward is however "a man capable of business & much attached to the Cause and is generally esteemed as a sober honest man." He awaits the "determi- nation of this unnappy dispute," before which it will be impossible to comply with any orders sent by his Excellency. The Proclamation in regard to the British Prisoners of War came to hand some time ago, many of these men are in the County, and upon being arrested and brought before him, had produced Certificates of their having taken the Oath of Allegiance to the State," have paid taxes, and behaved as good Citizens. Others who have friends in the County seem desirous to "become subjects." He will not send them down until an answer is received to this letter. The clothing due from the county should have been sent, but no one would undertake to carry it, unless paid in Specie. He has "one Eifle & Shot-bag taken from a deserter;" as it is public property, "would wish to know what is to be done with her." Col: Thos: Newton jnr: to Col: Wm. Davies. March 17 "Dr. Sir We are at a loss for the laws of the last session of Assembly. Norfolk I shall esteem it a particular favor if you'd get them from the Printer & send them to me, having a right to a set as member of the Assembly & a justice for this place, we only rec'd the law for procuring a wagon two days ago, have not the Act yet for holding a Court of Claims, nor know not how to proceed in getting our quoto of men for the Conti- nental Service.

I am, with respect, yr: obt. Serv't." March 18th Major Pat. Lockhart to Gov: Harrison. Botetourt Eesigning his commission, in as much as he cannot do duty in the Co' present confused state of things, growing out the dispute between Mr. Ward and Mr. McClenahan as to their right to the Lieu't: Colonelcy. Ward had been recommended by the Court of which he (Lockhart) was a member, and he opposed his election, from no hostility to him, but be- cause to promote him over McClenahan, would be a positive affront to the latter. This recommendation had given such general dissatisfaction, that all the officers had resigned, at a time when "an Insurrection, of the Tories in a neighboring County was Hourly expected." Subse- quently, Mr. Ward had intimated that rather than "impede the service" by persisting in his course, he would decline contending for the com- mission, but he has since been Commissioned, whereupon the whole of the Officers have resigned, and the districts cannot be laid off, nor can a Court Martial be held in the County. The greatest confusion has fol- lowed, and no officer can be expected to do his duty with credit or satis- faction "while matters are in their present "situation." March 19th JOHN BECKLEY TO Gov: HARRISON. "Sir Kichmond The writ of ne exeat republica, being judicial process, the Attorney General cannot, I presume, with propriety, prepare one in the case you have been pleased to refer to him: nor for the same reason, does it seem to come within the letter of those powers, which the Constitution or, any particular law, hath placed in the Executive. In the present case, two remedies lie open to Mr. Desmarais. By the first if either of the parties is a citizen of this State, upon a Bill filed and allegations proved, his Judges of the High Court of Chancery, during vacation, or the Court in term time, will order a writ of ne exeat republica: the other remedy is provided by the Act of October Session 1779, "for encouraging the commerce of nations," by which it is declared "that the Consul of any particular State or nation, residing here, may take cognizance of all differences, controversies and litigations, arising between subjects or citizens of his own State only, and finally to deter- mine and compare the same, according to such rules or laws, as he shall think fit, and such determinations to carry into Execution. And that
Page 103

Of these two remedies, the latter appear to be the most summary and effectual for Mr. Desmaris. On behalf of the Attorney General, I have honor to be, Sir, Your Excellency's most obdt, humble servt." J. Madison Jnr: Jos: Jones and A. Lee to Gov: Harrison. March 19th "Sir The motion we made for Congress to accept the JBeef, that might be Philadelphia supplied by the State for the Southern Army, above her former quota of that article, in divisions for its value in the last quota, is referred to The Superintendent of Finance, who has not yet reported upon it. If our accounts are true touching the evacuation of Charlestown, which is said to have taken place on the 24th ult: it will hardly be an object for us to press, considering the precedent it will establish. The capture of Cornwallis and of his Army has made a great impres- sion on the European Courts in our favor; & the evacuation of the Southern parts of the U. S., will probably raise such an opinion of the establishment of our Independency beyond the power of G. B. to shake, as to incline some of those Courts to an Alliance, that may make our Enemies despair of ever succeeding against us. The alarm in England is very great. Strong & pointed Petitions have been presented against continuing the war, the opposition in the House of Commons has reached within 41 of the ministerial majority, & the accounts from N. York are, that the Lords, North, Germain & Sandwich are actually displaced. Yigorous proportions on our part, for the ensuing campaign, will give such efficiency to these impressions, as may probably put a period to the war. We enclose* the paper which will show the success of our Ally in the W. Indies. Our Colleague Mr. Eandolph, who left this place for Richmond yester- day, will give you a more particular account of the contents of our latest Dispatches & of the proceedings here, than it is proper for us to commit to paper.

With much "concern" he informs his Excellency "that it is probable that day will begin with tumult & End in some thing worse." He is convinced "opposition will be made to the allottment, and not a role or list of any kind be left with our Officer, which (if nothing worse) will put an effectual stop to the allottment."— The people are much dis- turbed in mind, and are highly indignant at the proposed drawing, and cannot be persuaded, but that it is imposed "contrary to the mind of the last Assembly." They are too much exasperated to be reasoned with, and are not aware of the "evil consequences of their conduct." Not- withstanding all this, he thinks with proper caution, and by allowing time for persuasion, and not compelling the immediate execution of the Law, many of the Districts may be induced "to draw their lots." To further ensure the draft, he recommends that every District that furnishes its quota of men, be credited with a "tour of militia duty" except on occasion of insurrection or invasion. By a temperizing policy much mischief may be prevented and probably m the course of two months many men may be inlisted. March 20th J. Bradford to Messrs. J. Madison & J. Jones Esqrs., Delegates in regard to certain military stores at that place belonging to State of Virginia. Boston They are yet unsold, and he has not been able "to get them off," altho' he has made every effort to do so. The most he can get for the shot is "the price of old iron." If risked "at vendue," they will scarcely bring costs. The Gov: of Massachusetts thought they "might be pur- chased for the use of our Castle" but they were not wanted—concludes "If the spirit of Privateering s'd again revive they may be in demand in part, and with that prospect its possible there might be those who might speculate." March 21st COL: Wl. DaVIES TO THE GOVERNOR. "Sir War Office * * * * * * * "As the Court of Berkeley have undertaken without any authority to direct the waggon and team which had been provided, to be delivered to the person from whom they were purchased, altho' they acknowledge that the money was tendered according to contract, I must beg your Excellency's instructions, whether prosecution ought not to be imme- diately commenced for the delinquency.

Dragoons, complains to Col: Davies that March 21st the Soldiers are suffering for want of Beef, "owing to neglect in the Petersburg Staff Department." They have been several days without meat, and have no prospect of getting any." Robt. Stephen informs Col: Davies, in reply, that the County had March 2lst been laid off into districts as ordered, and Sixty eight beeves, and all Berkeley Co. the clothing required had been supplied. The latter he hears, "are decaying in the possession of the Person, by Law appointed to receive them." Col: Davies to the Governor. March 22d "Sir * * * * "The cavalry in the War Office neighborhood of Petersburg will probably never be better equipped in this State, than they now are, and General Greene has sent, I am told, more than once for them. They allege the want of cloaths, but the p ct is that Colonel White carried with him to the Southward all the cloth- ing which he received from the State and at York, which was more than sufficient for his whole corps; yet he left no cloaths for any of the men that he did not take out with him. Colonel Baylers cloathing has gone on from Philadelphia to General Greenes army, and he is waiting till he can have it brought back. Colonel Bayler has more horses than men in the State, and Colonel White more men than horses." Under those circumstances he desires instructions, whether he shall or not, inform the officers, that no more supplies can be issued to them, without proper Continental authority. 14

Gov: Jefferson had ordered him to transmit all such Tobacco to the Executive, but the Enemy had pre- vented this. He has had no orders Since Genl: Nelson's, requiring him to hold it, subject to Executive demands. Eequests instructions &c. March 22d Capt: Churchill Jones, 3d Eegt. L.

Staunton Asking his interference with the Executive to have him excused from "Serving as a Commissioner" for the district of Greenbrier, in as much as he has much "business as a lawyer" in that quarter. Does not con- sider himself qualified to become a Judge, and would much prefer to "take a stand at ye Bar." In addition to this the Court for the District of Montgomery will probably set at the same time, and as he is "engaged on one side of all the disputed causes" his appointments will necessarily prevent the acceptance of the office. tfareh 22d Arcd. Blair, Clerk of the Council, certifies that Wm.

House, under Genl: the Duke de Choisy. Upon receiving the letter of the Executive he had sent a Sergeant and guard with proper authority to receive those negroes from the French and return them to their owners; whereupon the Duke considered this proceeding unneces- sary; and insisted that the Governor and himself had agreed as to how the negroes were to be disposed of before he left Eichmond. Col: Eead then dismissed the Sergeant and guard, and now informs his Excellency of the Duke's course, with the information that "there is a number of negroes with the Troops" and unless they are reclaimed, "those who have Property of that kind in the vicinity of the Camps will suffer by their going off," &c. Major Belfield informs Col: Davies that it is impossible for him to March 22d march the Troops Southward without Colo. Baylor's orders.

From the scattered "state of our supplys" until lateiy he has not been able to answer the enquiries made by Qol: Davies on the subject of clothing for the Southern Army &c. Since his accepting this office, his entire time has been given to collecting the clothing and preparing for a general distribution of it, which he regrets to say has not sooner been in his power to effect. Now however he is happy to say that the supply in most of the necessary articles is sufficient for the

He will not be able to make up past deficiencies if this be done; the expence and delay being so great in sending Stores to Genl: Green's remote position. It would give him particular pleasure to comply with the requests of Col: Davies, by sending supplies of clothing to Capt: Peyton, but Congress having lately declared "all State appointments void" in the clothing department, this is impossible. M-r. John Hamilton has lately been appointed "Clothier Genl: to the South- ern Army" through whom in future all supplies of clothing will be issued. To facilitate the recruiting service in Yirginia, a quantity clothing will be deposited with Col: Febiger, who will account for the distribution of the same. Concludes, "I beg you will accept of my best thanks for your polite offer of assistance in the Execution of my business, which when occasion offers, I shall take the liberty of availing myself of." March 23d COL: DAVIES TO THE GOVERNOR. "Sir War Office I received yesterday from Genl: Clarke, a letter of the 18th of last montb. He is very anxious to be joined by Colo: Dabney, and repre- sents that the infantry of the new legion altho' not very numerous, would be of infinite service to his operations, and if they should reach him by the first of June, he hopes they will be sufficient to turn the scale. 'He writes in a very urgent manner for the Cannon your Excel- lency promised him, but at all events, he says he must have two brass four-pounders. The piece he has is a three-pounder, and this he repre- sents to be too heavy. I am therefore apprehensive that the four pounder we have will be of no service to him, as they are all of them old fashioned heavy French pieces, and weigh nearly as much as the common six-pounders. If there are any here belonging to the Conti- nent, it perhaps might be as well to take them, as your Excellency has agreed to the exchange of our battering Cannon for lighter. Genl: Clarke writes also for rigging &c. for boats, and adds that without them he cannot execute his designs; and that unless he receives considerable supplies by June, the consequences may fee fatal to the Country. How to transport these various articles^ together with the clothing appears to me a difficulty not easily' overcome. Genl: Clarke seems to think it best, if Col: DabneyJ^'infantry is sent, that they should go down the Ohio with the whole of the supplies of every kind, and there are boats belonging toy the State now lying in the Eed Stone in Monongalia: if Col: Dabney cannot reinforce him the General desires that every thing that can be sc»nt him, and particularly the two brass four pounders, may go by Holston on cars made for the purpose, with a small escort through the wilderness. Mr. Carny, however thinks it impossible. Genl: Clarke recommends this gentleman as very serviceable to him. He

March 25th COL: DAVIES TO THE GOVERNOR. "Sir War Office There are Six 6-pounders, and four 3s, all of brass, belonging to the Continent, now at man Chester. The three pounders will probably answer Genl: Clarkes purpose fully, though I suppose he will not require more than two of them, especially as by the order of Council, all of his regular troops are to be consolidated into two Companies of Infantry. I mention this the more particularly, as I shall send out the order of Council by Mr. Carny, and unless the Executive make some alterations in it, Genl: Clarke will be obliged to dismiss all his Officers of Artillery, and those of the infantry will be incapable of managing the pieces prop- erly, at least 'till this campaign is over, and probably they will not understand their business until then. The other three-pounders at man- chester, will answer extremely well for Captain Eoane's company in the regular legion, and are much better adapted to the nature of a light Corps, than the heavy pieces we have of our own. As no application of mine to the Continental Commissaries of military Stores will be effect- ual to procure them, I must beg the favour of your Excellency to give an Order for them, should you approve of the measure.

"Sir Norfolk Your Excellency's (circular) Letter I received & immediately apply'd to the sheriff to call on the Land holders for one half of their tax, which I shall apply to raising troops according to your directions, but am afraid the ill fare and ragged appearance of the men stationed here will be a great obstacle.

I pray you to take this matter into consideration, as in this case if a future invasion happens the people hereabouts will determine whether it is not better to stay with the Enemy & be received as good citizens with money in their purses, or turn out & endeavor to defend their country & return in poverty to their possessions.

March 28th Begs pardon for being troublesome, but his Sons "Herbert & Will" Sussex Co assure him, he is always ready to oblige, &c—"Tarlton and his gang of theives" paid him a visit on their turn up the country the last summer, and took from him "six valuable naggs"—He had before this furnished the service "with two of his best," so that he was without any, except a "pretty valuable gelding" left by Tarlton, "but quite run down"— This horse he had fattened, and had taken the lawful steps to let his owner recover him if he could be found. Under the Order of the Board of War, collecting all horses left by the enemy, Capt: M. Wall of the Q. M.

ARMISTEAD TO THE GOVERNOR. Richmond Having been for some time discontinued as u Commissary of Stores," but not having yet received his pay as such; and in view of the increased expence of living in the town, he begs to be allowed to "take up goods" according to their current value not exceeding one-half his wages due, in payment thereof. He will interfere as little as possible, if this be allowed, with Articles that may be necessary for the Army—Precedents of this kind are not wanting, and he trusts the application, altho' it involves a bad bargain on his side, may be considered by the Executive a reasonable one. March 29th Capt: John Pryor to Col: Davies. Richmond He has for some time been anxious to make an arrangement by which a more complete magazine for the State could be established, than by supplying the materials and relying upon the Continental Laboratory. As this Laboratory is about to be moved to New London, he suggests some steps should be taken by which men can be instructed in the art of preparing "the different composition" for fixed ammunition, making port-fires, Tubes, &c., &c, and he has proposed to Capt: Green now with him, to instruct Capt: Allen and others of the most expert workmen in this art. Capt: Green complains very justly of his never having received compensation from the State for his services. He had lost everything by his efforts to save the Public Stores from the Enemy, and is willing to compromise "for one piece of Irish Linn en" for his former services, and will, for another piece undertake to instruct Capt: Allen and the men, as above mentioned. An excellent Tin-man. whose term of service in the Continental department has expired, is in the town and should also be employed. He will detain Capt: Green until a reply is received. March 29th Edmond Brooke to Col: Davies. 11 Farmers He received the warrant appointing him Second Lieut: in "the Con- Hall.n tinental Regt of Artillery raised by the State," and has "experienced all the fatigues and inconveniences attendant on a Soldier," but having never reced. any "arrears to defray the expenses consequent thereto," desires to be informed how they can be gotten at.

House in April 1781, as Commissioner for that County, and Dep: Com: of Issues for the State of Yirginia, he was required by the Baron to supply the troops with "one gill of Rum or other spirits prman, and a Pint to each officer." All the continental Stores had been sent up the country, and the order could not be obeyed except by buy- ing or borrowing. This he did from "Mr. David Frankling of Chester- field County," and supplied the men, as "continental Com: of Issues" taking receipts &c. He gave his individual obligation with security for this rum, depending upon Mr. John Broune Deputy Commissioner to see that the accounts were settled.* By his negligence this has not been done, and either he or Mr. Franklin must suffer. He trusts however that the matter may be settled through Major Forsyth, who has in his office the "certificates given the 26th April 1781." Mr. Chas: Dick, acknowledges receipt of Col: Davies letter informing March 29th him "that nothing cou'd yet be done towards carrying on the Factory." Fredericks- Also of the 5th inst., mentioning there would be no order issued for the bur£ articles arising from the specific tax, in the adjacent counties, to be appropriated to the use and support of the Factory. He does not desire to be responsible for more than is absolutely necessary; and regrets to hear that no "meat" will be paid in, money only can get it. Some of the workmen will re-engage if they are "victualled as usual." He is sorry so much time has been lost, and probably more, as arms are certainly needed, for want of which alone, the Enemy have been enabled to penetrate so far into the country. Col: Wm. Davies to the Governor. March 30th The "Financier" (Robt. Morris) advertises among other ordnance War Office "twenty-six 18-pound carronades for sale at the Head of Elk, at 213£ dolls: a pair," Suggests, it will be better to purchase those, than rely upon Mr. Zane: or at least exchange for them some of the "heavy cannon," as the Continental Laboratory is soon to be removed from Richmond to New London, and as all the "cannon ammunition" has been prepared & furnished by it, he draws attention to the necessity of providing for a supply after the removal, and suggests that a sufficient number of persons be instructed "in composing and fixing ammunition" for this purpose—Capt: Green, who is well "versed in the business" and wfro has already been in the service of the State, is willing to receive

"a piece of Irish linnen" for what is already due him from the State, March 30th and "for another piece," will undertake to "teach proper persons in every branch of this business"—A good tinman will also be necessary. The Governor endorses the above, giving the sense of the Council as opposed to purchasing the carronades, "their weight of metal render- ing them unfit to answer Genl: Clarke's purposes"—but approve the suggestions in regard to Capt: Green and the "Tinman."

Indeed the current of adjudication before the revolution, seems to have been, that an acquittal by an examining court is a good plea in bar. This, as I have been informed, was founded on the peculiar phraseology of the law, respecting such courts—But on the other hand, it is notorious that when a grand jury finds a bill unot true," the suspected person may be again drawn into question at a future day.

April 8th "Dear Sir,' The Savages began their Hostilities early in February, and Jefferson are constantly ravaging the most Interior parts of the County, which makes it impossible for any one Settlement to assist another—Even the Populous* parts of Lincoln are infested, & from the number of Horses ^kp^Couii- already taken off by them, it is notorious to every capacity, that their j^y thelsav- design is to disable the Inhabitants from removing, untill their present ages &c intended Campaign from Detroit against Fort Nelson can be carried into effect. This design is communicated to us through three different channels & so well authenticated that it cannot be doubted: and the Conduct of the Enemy ever since last Fall, coincides exactly with the information. One fourth of the militia is called for by G-enl: Clarke, for the purpose of Fortifying the Fort against a Seige—but from the immediate danger, in which every one conceives his own Family, the authority of militia officers at such a distance from Government grows every day weaker & weaker, and the new invented Ideas of a sep State, calculated on purpose for disaffection & an Evasion of duty, are" so many causes to retard the necess^rjJBiigixiesspand seems to threaten us on all sides with Anarchy, Confusion & I may add Destruction—But even to suppose that the Works can be completed before the arrival of the Enemy, it is then impossible that G-enl: Clark, with the inconsider- G-enl: Clark able number of Troops He now has, can defend it: and a Dependance anything0d° on Militia scattered over three extensive Counties, under the circum- stances before mentioned, is depending upon a very great Uncertainty, especially when the Enemy have all the advantages of a heavy current from high up the Miamia to the very place of their destination, they can float from the mouth of that river to the Falls in less than thirty hours—And to suppose that our Spies should discover their approach as Jefferson Co high up as Miamia, it will then take eight days at least, before we can be Advantages collected, if we were under the strictest military Subordination—Should thVllnemy^ no reinforcements arrive in May & G-enl: Clark be obliged to evacuate &c his post, rather than suffer such a quantity of military stores to fall into the Hands of the Enemy, and the whole Indian Army let loose among the scattered Inhabitants unprepared to receive them, what must be the consequence?

You are sensible from your own knowledge of this Western Country, that no place can be better calculated for the purpose of carrying on the Indian War against (if I may use the Expression) the Interior Frontiers of this State, than the Falls of the Ohio—Its situation is exactly centrical to. the Northern, Southern, & Western Tribes. The distance to Holston, Clinch. JsTew River, Green Brier &c. very trifling— Their supplies already here provided, & the communication to the Brit- ish Posts in Canada very safe and easy. I would further observe that if this Country must be laid waste, which nothing but an early rein- forcement or an Accident can prevent; those settlements above men- tioned must once more experience the disadvantages of a Savage War & must contend with more than ten times the number which have here- tofore visited their Borders—One who is unacquainted with the true Situation of this County & also me, might probable conclude that those reflections might proceed from Timidity—But you are acquainted with both, and can Judge whether it is so or not.

Page 123
CALEKDAK OF STATE PAPEES. 123 After coming nigh to one of the Towns, they discovered some Indians 1782. on both sides of the Kiver Muskingum. They then concluded to divide April 8th themselves into two Parties, the one to cross the Eiver, and the other to attack those Indians on this side. When that party got over the Eiver, they saw one of the Indians coming up towards them. They laid themselves flat on the ground, waiting till the Indian was nigh enough, then one of them shot the Indian and broke his arm: then three of the Militia ran towards him with Tomahawks: when they were yet a little Distance from him, he asked them, why they fired at him, he was Minister Sheboscks (John Bulls) son; but they took no notice of what he said, but kill'd him on the spot—They then surrounded the Field, and took all the other Indians prisoners—The Indians told them they were Christians and made no resistance: when the militia gave them to understand, that they must bring them as prisoners to Fort Pitt, they seemed to be very glad—They were ordered to prepare themselves for the Journey, and to take all their effects along with them. Accordingly they did so. They were asked how it came they had no cattle? they answered that the small stock that was left them had been sent to Sandusky. In the Evening the Militia held a Council, when the Commander of the Militia told his men that he would leave it to their choice, either to carry the Indians as Prisoners to Fort Pitt or to kill them—when they agreed that they should be kill'd. Of this resolution of the Council, they gave notice to the Indians by two Messengers, who told them, that as they had said they were Christians, they would give them time this night to prepare themselves accordingly—Hereupon the women met together and sung hymns and psalms all night, and so did likewise the men, and kept on singing as long as there were three alive— In the morning the militia chose two Houses, which they called the Slaughter Slaughter Houses, and then fetch'd the Indians two or three a^ a time Houses with ropes about their necks, and dragged them into the Slaughter Houses, when they knocked them down: then they set those two Houses on fire, as likewise all the other Houses. This done, they went to tho other Towns and set fire to the Houses, took their plunder, and returned to the Monaungahela, where they kept a Vendue among themselves.

CALENDAE OF STATE PAPEES. 125 Edmd Eandolph, Atty: Genl: to the Governor. 1782. tt g^r April 8th The capital facts in the petition of Mace Freeland are, that Eobert .Richmond Williams, a bastard, hath become felo de se, is intestate and has left neither wife nor issue of his body. The Legal consequences from hence are, that his lands belong to the Commonwealth in right of escheat, and his personal estate in right of forfeiture—In this situation of the pro- perty of the self murder, the petitioner solicits the executive to grant to him the slaves and personalties of Williams, he being in that line of succession, which would have cast them upon him, had Williams been legitimate. I cannot readily see the reason upon which the interposition of the Executive is desired, with respect to the slaves. For the Act of assembly declaring slaves to be real estate, provides that they shall not escheat, for a defect of inheritable blood (See ) and a subsequent Act forbids a forfeiture of them, except in those cases in which lands and tenements may be forforfeited—But as Lands and tenements are not forfeitable for suicide, the slaves in this instance are equally protected against forfeiture. It is clear too that they cannot escheat. It follows there- fore, that the Executive, altho' their power to regrant should be acknowl- edged, need not interpose in regranting the Slaves since they are not vested in the Commonwealth. The Act of 1779 concerning escheats and forfeitures does indeed assert, that slaves accrue to the Common- wealth by way of escheat, but this institution relates to British subjects alone, and leaves the former of the two foregoing acts to its full operation in the case of citizens. Presuming that Eobert Williams hath been found Felo ^ se by a regular inquisition (which moreover by no tt^*~o appears from the peti- tion) I shall not deny that JMace Freeland will be stripped of the per- sonal estates, unless the Commonwealth should restore it. But thro' what channel of power is restitution to come? British Governors have regranted, it is true; but they acted thus upon ground of prerogative alone. Our Constitution excludes perogative, and I do not know any law, which delegates to the Executive of this day an authority to regnant. Should your Excellency and the Council, holding sentiments different from those which I have now delivered, decide in favor of your power to regrant, propriety would seem to require, that the petitioner should produce the inquisition, upon the body of Eobert Williams, and evidence of his allegations before any measures could be taken in compliance with his request. ******* "Most of the late letters from the Virginia delegates in Congress have referred to me for particular communications.

As that part of the Frontier is much exposed & Indeed has been frequently visited by the Enemy for several years past, perhaps your Excellency might Judge it proper to order some Gun Powder to this County, of which it is destitute, and direct the manager of the Lead mines to give a small supply of Lead from time to time, as it may be wanted for Public Service: and at the same time direct that some

I laid off the Fort, upon the simplest plan of a Quadrangle & divided the work equally among four of the most pushing men, with a Bastion to each, authorizing them to employ workers from this & the neighboring Stations & assuring them of their pay myself.

It will be readily understood by the Executive why he could not with proprietory discuss the 3d 5th & 6th queries" with those gentlemen, and had therefore disposed of the "ideas therein suggested in a very few words. He now submits them, with the other queries contained in the paper, and adds— "What is necessary to be done on this occasion, it belongs not to me to determine; Eut I cannot forbear to express our apprehension, that our citizens will be alienated from, and lose all confidence in our government, if they should sustain injury for acts done by them, as public servants, or the decisions of Courts holden under the authority of Virginia, Should be annulled as flowing from an usurped jurisdiction.

APril 23d The office of the Superintendent of Finance does not contain the infor- mation you wish relative to the amount of payments made by the States in the new Continental Bills, no regular return having yet been trans- mitted tither. As far as the portion of these bills allotted to the use of Congress shall be unissued, as also as far as the requisitions made in them on the states, shall be unpaid, they will constitute a charge ag'st the States respectively. But the rate at which they are to be charged is yet to be determined by Congress. The Delegates have long had it in charge from the Executive to pro- vide a conveyance to Virginia of certain stores taken on their passage from Richmond & carried into Boston, or if that could not be accom- plished, to have them sold. They lye in the hands of Mr. J. Bradford, formerly our agent for the U. States. We have written various letters to him on the subject & rec'd various answers, without being able to fulfill either of the alternatives. The first indeed has long been relin- quished. Our last letter requested him preemptorily to sell the stores & remit the amount. We have again endeavoured to obtain from Congress some explicit decision on the territorial cession of Virginia, that the Assembly may not again be left in uncertainty on that subject. The sickness of the Pres'dt which suspended the vote of Maryland, furnished a pretext for postponing the business, which we judge it prudent to yield to.

The South Carolina men, with a determination that reflects honour on them, has lately penetrated the Indian Country on the sources of the Mobile. The last account received by a friendly Cherokee from the Tenassee, a large Detachment was in a critical situation: we were to have cooperated with them, which would have made the work easy: but for want of the energy of Government, we failed in our effort. The Northward Indians has form'd an intercourse with the unfriendly Cherokees and continues their depredations, both on the frontiers of this and Montgomery County, leaving traces of real distress wherever their parties penetrates. In the Kcntuekey County the scene is likely to be more bloody— Genl: Clarke writes me that we will have a least one thousand more Indians added to our Enemies, this year than last, if measures are not taken early this spring to divert or crush their confederacys. Pardon this intrussion! lam insensibly led into discussions to me^living in security, which may let affecting scenes pass with indifference. I have a predilection for my native Country.

I told him as the weather was so cold, I thought it would be pitty to turn the poor Fellows out of their Hutts, as they seemed to be very warm & comfortable. I am sure I have made a point to furnish every thing I was able & am sure have done every thing in my power to accommodate them.

My wife joins with me in Our respectfull Compliments to you & Mrs. Harrison—am D'r S'r your most Obed't Serv't." Col: Wm. Preston to Gov: Harrison. April 26th Enclosing a letter to himself from Col Walter Crockett dated April Botetourt 15th 1782 giving account of the Killing of two of Capt: Moifett's sons, Co' and of the whole family of Capt: Inglis in Burks Garden,—also of his having ordered Colo. Cloyd to call out at once the militia to assemble at "David Doaks' mill" to protect the settlements, as the people talk of "breaking up" unless help is afforded them. He calls also for provisions, as they cannot be supplied "on Clinch." Col: Preston adds, "I wrote . to your Excellency the 10th Instant informing you of the Damages the Savages had done in Montgomery. I last night received the inclosed letter from Col: Crockett. It appears that Capt: Inglis' family were not burned in the House, as he imagined, but were taken prisoners. He raised a party of men and pursued the Enemy: after some days march he overtook them and recovered his Wife and one child, both tomahaked, but perhaps not mortally, and his Slaves. One of his children they nfLirdered, Killed an Officer of the party and made their escape. The Enemy attacked some other Families, but were repulsed tho' I beleive without loss. They Killed a man on Bluestone, and I am told a Woman at Cubbersons' Bottom on New Eiver. Their signs have been seen in various parts Qf the Country, which has given the greatest alarm to the Inhabitants: and what is very extraordinary that five Houses they attacked, that four belonged to Officers, and some of them a considera- ble distance within the Frontier Settlements, which induces me to beleive they are conducted by Tories. I am at a loss what measures to fall upon for the Defence of the distressed Inhabitants. The Public Credit is so low, that I am doubtful it will be impossible to procure Provisions, as no Specific Tax was brought in last Year, and but a small prospect of this year producing any in the present Exigency. Provisions can-

I would therefore most earnestly beg your ExeelPy's Advice and Instruc- tion herein, by Mr. McGarock, as not only my own Family, but a great number of other Families are exposed to the cruelty of a Savage Enemy. The general scarcity of Gun Powder is also an alarming circumstance. Indeed from the present gloomy prospect, I am apprehensive the Inhab- itants of the Frontier Settlements will be obliged to remove to places of Safety—I make no doubt but your Excellency in Council will consider the Distress of those People and fall on every method in your Power to releive them.

They had been apprehended and sent to the Army at Gloucester, but as soon as they found they were put into the Continental service, deserted again—Many were never caught because of the convenience of escaping by water; and some had ^one to the enemy. The eight men sent to Richmond, four of whom were substitutes and only eighteen years of age, had all been sent back "as not being able bodied"—He expresses surprise at this, as he "was then satisfied that those men were better than the drafts, as they went freely & wood have made good soldiers after being awhile in ye Army." The Clothing and wagon required of the County have been furnished. The Situation of the County very bad: the officers without commis- sions, altho' more than a year ago he had applied for them, and the men without arms—He has been endeavouring to get a vessel to transport the Salt to Mr. Young as ordered, but there is "no such thing to be had." The Enemy are still in the Bay, notwithstanding the presence of French Cruizers, and he therefore thinks it would be safer and but. little dearer, to "have it waggoned."

Or rather let* me turn to what is more within my line, by observing, that the inferiority of our army in point of numbers, to that of our ally, while they acted at Yorktown, has been considered in Europe, as a proof of the assertions of Great Britain, has been urged as an argument of our weakness, our weariness of the war, or our internal divisions—A moment's reflection will show the advantages, that this affords our antagonist, in a negotiation: how much it weakens the claim we make, and how many important benefits may be lost forever, by our appearing in Europe, to receive pur Indepen- dence rather as a gift, than to have established it by our exertions—But Sir, it is still in our power to repair these errors—Let us avail ourselves of this favorable moment for expelling the enemy, and recovering our diminished Credit among the nations of the Earth. I make no apology for the liberty 1 take—Your Excellency, I am persuaded, is too sensible of the truth of these observations to think they could be delivered with less earnestness by one, who feels their importance; and I am confident you will bring them before the Legislature of your State in such manner as will best serve to ensure them their attention."

In as much then, as the Salvation of the Eastern Shore, which had already furnished so much to the cause of the Country, depended upon the presence of some of these troops, he begs Col: Davies inter- cession with the Gov: & Council in their behalf, and Closes with a request for arms, ammunition and clothing, very much needed for the use of the militia—

The appre- hensions of the designs of the Detroit Gentry in this Country is reduced to a certainty. They have their eye on this post and the Span- ish Illinois: if they carry their point its consequence is obvious—We are taking every measure our policy dictates to us to put the departm't in as good a position of defence as our circumstances will permit. A late confusion among the Inhabitants, occasioned I believe by some emmissaries from the Northward hath retarded our progress in business considerably, but by the exertions of many of the principal officers of the Country, that deserve credit we are like to reduce the people to subordination, in short they begin to suspect those that first confused them was their greatest Enemies. I believe in a short time it will be dangerous for a man to speak of new Government in this Quarter, except among a small party of black- guards. The body of the people now seem to be allarmed for fear Yir- ginia will give up their interest. There is a formidable fortress that will soon be compleated at this post, but my greatest dependance is in block- ing up the Ohio at the mouth of Miami with gallies. We have two gondolas ready to mount, and a gaily on the stocks, that will be finished in about twenty days, that I think will do the business. She is seventy three feet Keel, calculated for the navigation of the Ohio, to have forty six oars, one hundred and ten men: one six, six fours, and a two-pounder is her proposed metal. We have great dependence on the Cannon you promised us, arriving in time; have lately received some encouraging reports respecting them. We arranged our business on as small a scale as possible to promise success. You may judge from your own circum- stances the situation of our Credit—If the Country can be saved from the impending blow, a remembrance of our past anxiety and trouble will give pleasure—Let our fate be what it will, I flatter myself that your Excellency will find that your business has been well attended to in this Quarter. If we should be so fortunate as to repel this invasion without too great a loss to ourselves, the Indians will all scatter to their different countries, and give a fair opportunity for a valuable stroke to be made amono* them—if you was to think it advisable to order about five hun- dred militia from Washington and Montgomery Counties to rendezvous at Kentucky the first of July, it might probably be attended with valu- able Consequences—Their fate depends on that of this Country, and I should suppose good policy wou'd require a body of them should imme- diately march to the support of this— My last letter will give you a full Idea of the Indian Department, the body of Indians on the Oubacbe have not yet declared War. I expect it to take place at the Grand Council this month at the Ouian. I am Sir, with the utmost Eespect, your Obedt. Servt."

I beg leave earnestly to recommend to you Sir, to give them what assistance you can. as I believe a number of the Towns are friendly attached to us and will not draw off, if we can supply them with some necessarys. I am now attending the Assembly of North Carolina ^t this place, to remonstrate to that Legislator the Impropriety of extend- ing their Western Settlements to near the Cherokee Towns on Tennes- see, as a petition from the back Country is laid before them for that purpose, which will unavoidably bring on war with that nation should our people proceed to form settlements adjoining their Towns, the Indians on their part, have shewed every mark of friendship for a people in their situation to do. I shall do everything in my Power to prevent a war from ensuing. The Indians are very desirous of going to the Congress agreeable to General Greene's recommendation, and if as much cash cou'd be furnished as wou'd defray the expence of Twenty Chief, I wou'd undertake to go with them.

Mountains, and to this burg place, in search of persons to contract for the repairs of our damaged arms, and hitherto have been altogether unsuccessfull. public proposals have become such a scarecrow, that the people Shudder at the bare mention of them, and seem so prejudiced that they are predetermined before they hear your scheme not to engage. Mr. Hunter seems to be the only one that I have seen who I think could be dej)ended on for this business, tho' he has been so much abused heretofore by the Public, that there remains but one way to engage him farther, which is to appropriate a certain part of the Taxes for his payment to be collected by the sheriffs & paid to him from the most convenient districts. At present he has discharged all his workmen. The Public Factory at this place is totally at a stand for want of provisions & in short for everything else, as Mr. Dick tells me that the whole of the damaged Arms might be repair'd here, he has a great number of very valuable workmen whom he has furlow'd for want of provisions—from this I shall set out to day for the Point of Fork & shall call on several Gentmn. in the way to whom I have wrote to make proposals. I now despair of any plan being effect- ual short of the one you proposed, of having an Act of Assembly for every Militia man to furnish himself w'th a stand of Arms complete within a certain limited period, and strike some line for a preference of purchasing out of the Public Stock, to prevent their being so dispers'd & remote from whom they might be first wanted, this would certainly encourage the manufacture of Arms in our own State & promote the importation of them from others, as there would be, I suppose near 50,000 stand wanted to complete the whole of our militia." * * * * I am, with the greatest respect & Esteem Dr. Sir, your mo: ob Servant."

War Office Having been desired by Genl: Greene and the "Commissary General of Prisoners" of the Southern Dept: to give every assistance, in exe- cuting the cartel in Virginia and thereby facilitate the exchange of prisoners, he draws attention to the fact that the American naval pri- soners on parole in this State seem "not known to any Commissary of prisoners at all." Many of these, seeing others exchanged, have found themselves unnoticed and neglected and have appealed to him for redress. He therefore suggests that all paroled prisoners in the State be notified through the "public papers" to report at once at his office. This will determine who are and who are not; worthy of official protec- tion. The sending of the six-months men from Eichmond has left the place entirely without a military guard: he therefore requests orders, whether the militia shall be called upon, or whether a "'Company from Col: Dabney's Legion shall be directed to come up"— The Executive adopt the suggestions above made: but order out the militia, until the arrival of Col: Dabney's men.

If that number is insufficient, the balance shall be supplied on the first notice. The enclosed Gazette will furnish your Excellency with all the parlia- mentary intelligence by which we are as yet enabled to interpret the views of the Enemy. The perseverance of the antiministerial party in the supposed efficacy of conciliatory overtures seems to be no less obstinate than that of the court has been, with respect to military coer- cion, and as manifestly portends a delay of peace. The path of our duty under these circumstances cannot be mistaken. A scrupulous fidelity to our foreign engagements & a vigorous preparation for expell- ing the enemy from our Country must press themselves on every atten- tion. Letters from Spain inform us that the Garrison taken at Minorca con- sisted of 2600, including every description, but 1500 only, of effective troops: and that this success of the Spanish Arms would be followed by redoubled ardor m the seize of Gibraltar. .

May llth His Excellency's letter of the 28th Feb'y had not been received until "Onancock" the 29th of March—in obedience to which, he had made the necessary enquiries in regard to the conduct of Edward Ker, and Edmund Custis, of Accomac, Colbourn Barrel and Jas: McAlpine, British Subjects—In the spring of 1781 a brig loaded with "wet and dry goods," bound from Charleston S. Carolina to Portsmouth Va., owned by Barrel, and com- manded by McAlpine, had been driven ashore on the coast of that County—There two men with the crew surrendered themselves to Mr. Arthur Upshur, who agreed that they should retain their Clothes and Chests undisturbed—He was the man willing to grant these terms, because he had apprehended they were coming to rob him, instead of with the intention of surrendering; and was also a very humane man— Barrel and McAlpine subsequently had applied to him (Col Corbin) for permission to go to Philadelphia with all his crew which he could not legally grant, but at the same time did not like to keep so many pri- soners in the county. In the meantime, after a proper conference with himself on the subject, Mr. Custis purchased of Barrel, some of his own private clothing, a small clock, a tellescope and a suit of curtains, all of which he had a right to do as these articles were the property of Barrel under his agreement with Mr. Upshur—They also had dealings with each other for two horses when they expected to go to Philadelphia &c, that in justice to Mr. Custis, he saw nothing improper in this, and had always considered him "a friend to American Independence"—Soon after the above transactions, these prisoners were exchanged at Ports- mouth for an equal number from that County—The horses left by McAlpine were with Mr. Ker, who sold one of them for 100 barrels corn, "not yet hard," and Capt: Parker seized the other. He does not think Mr. Ker, in bartering for the corn, intended it for the enemy at Portsmouth, in as much as he had behaved with the greatest caution since the year 1776, since which time he had been under suspicion: though he (Corbin) did not consider Ker as friendly to American Inde- pendence—Col: Corbin expresses much regret, his Excellency should still dwell upon the "illegal intercourse," carried on between the people of that peninsula and the enemy; but refers to the case of Eev: John Lyon, who although tried and convicted, was nevertheless allowed to return and was then at large amongst the people, much to the surprise of all—This illicit trade had been the source of many and great evils, but a desperate remedy" to a desperate state of things had been applied the — 21

War Office Corbin of the Eastern Shore, and from Col: Dabney in command at Portsmouth in regard to the state of things in that peninsula and the removal of troops &c— Col: Cropper writes on the 2nd May "The purpose of this letter is (if possible) to obtain permission for these soldiers, or a part of them to remain among us, for without some regular force stationed here this shore must be ruined. At all times we are surrounded by danger, and the season is now come, in which we are continually in alarm. At this moment there are iour or more barges of the Enemy on the coast of Accomac. two captured a schooner in sight of my house yesterday, and I received certain intelligence last night that two more are at Chingo- teague (the next inlet above the one I live in) on their way from New York—Two barges landed their crews at Major Custis' on the 17th inst: and would have done considerable mischief there and in the neighbor- hood, had it not been for the activity of Major Poulson's troops, in con- junction with that of the militia—With a small regular force to watch this kind of enemy, and to follow them up and down the coast, the militia certainly can be alarmed of the time and place they are want- ing, but without them the militia will be constantly marching and Countermarching, sometimes too soon and sometimes too late, and they will be so harrassed and hindered from their farms, that often times they will prefer not turning out to save the property of their neigh- bours rather than run the risque of a false alarm. This County has furnished so many men for the Army and Navy heretofore, that it is exceedingly drained of men, and unable to station guards nigj^tly, equal to its protection: therefore Sir, be assured that the Salvation of the Eastern Shore, separated as it is from any succours that might be sent from the Western, depends in a great measure on the men you have ordered to bo taken from us—
Page 166
166 CALENDAR OF STATE PAPERS. 1782. Let me beg you Sir, to communicate the intention of this letter in a May 16th manner better than I am capable of doing to His Excellency our Gov- ernor and his honourable Council and send me by the bearer, as soon as possible their answer thereto. Use your influence with them to save this Eastern Shore, by suffering at least a third part of the men we raised under the last draft law, to remain among us. I conceive (and hope you will on reflection think so too) that these men could be of more service on this shore, than on any part of the Continent." Col: Corbin writes at the same date, "I was this day informed that the regular troops stationed on our shore for our protection were imme- diately to be withdrawn—I have therefore taken the liberty of repre- senting to you the horrid dangers with which we were threatened about 12 mos: past, by the Barges that infest our Coasts aided and assisted by the Maryland Refugees and the disaffected among ourselves— Pardon me for reporting (for I am sure it must be fresh in your minds.) the bloody plots which those inhuman wretches formed against the principal well affected inhabitants of this County. I pass over the many plundering scenes which have been exhibited in this County, honest families surprised in the night and robed of all their valuables, striped naked of cloaths, turned into the open air men, women and children, regarding neither age or sex, and their peaceful habitations burnt to ashes, and shall only mention that they had appointed the night, prepared a number of ropes as instruments of death, and marked their devoted victims; but the kind hand of providence was against them: a few nights before the appointed time, a party of them went out to induce the negroes to join, more effectually to carry into execu- tion the black designs, but one of them being discovered by a master whose slave he was enticing to join him, called on the villain to know what business he had there? who replied, I will soon let you know, and soon after shot the master dead—The neighbours of the deceased with a number of well affected citizens went in pursuit of the murderers, caught the slave before mentioned, whom they had carried off by force, and being by him informed who were the guilty persons, three of the ringleaders were immediately seized upon, carried to the gallows, where, (after making a free and full confession of their guilt as related by the negro) they were hanged as a terror to like offenders—These are the natural consequences which are produced by a want of protection, and a due execution of the laws of the land, which could not be effected in times of anarchy and confusion without military aid— Now Sir, as order and good Government cannot approve such illegal exertions as above mentioned, altho' excited by a love of humanity, & exercised upon the worst of beings, least general Anarchy take place; then hope you will use your influence to have a part of these troops (if all cannot be granted) to be stationed among us. I cannot doubt 3rour assistance and success on this occasion"—

The cavalry are much in want of Saddles: those on hand are unfit for service." Gray Briggs to Col: Davies. May 16th Eegretting his inability to collect the revenue in the County, because « Wales" "the larger majority" of the people omitted to list their tithables the Din^jddie last year. The defaulters are liable to a penalty, and the Grand Jury will doubtless present them, but "we shall never get a petit jury to find guilty those who can prove that the magistrates, with whom they were to enlist, were hiding from the enemy great part of the summer, and when they returned home, that masters of families were generally per- forming military duty 'til the last of October." This should have been anticipated by the Legislature, and the Commissioners should have been supplied with lists of tithables for the present and not the former year: this would have removed the complaints against a law, which as it now stands, subjects numbers of people to the payment of a tax on slaves "that are dead or shipped beyond Sea by the British"— Col: Ed'd Carrington to the Governor. May 17th "Sir Capt: Young may possibly have some delicacy in engaging in the Richmond measure I have to propose to him of doing the duties necessary in the Continental Quarter Master's line at this place, unless he could first have the express approbation of your Excellency in Council, therefor. I am so well assured he will be competent to the business of both the Continent & State, that I am really desirous of employing him, & there- fore wish to have every impediment to his acceptance removed. On these considerations I take the liberty of asking that your Excellency will be pleased to obtain such approbation in this case, as will be satis- factory to him.

The reasons we come, are that our Chiefs concluded, if their young men came, it would not have the same effect; as they confided that their sentiments would be uttered by us, as they wished them to be expressed, and that they would have weight with you, as the case of our nation calls for speedy relief—We heard that our brothers, the Americans, was much displeased with us. The reasons we hardly can guess. Col: Martin threatens us often, and says we will be visited by an army again, if any more of his Countrymen are plundered or scalped by our nation. The roguery of the Tories, that came among us, and the Theives of our people that join them, we cannot restrain, as we are unsupported by you. Many of our people are now lying out, and knows not what to do, afraid of your enemies, and your people—We ventured in with dread: but are now glad to find your people, so friendly disposed, and you so ready to hear the greivance of a distressed nation. Brother, we are very scarce of provisions, and will suffer, if we have not the opportunity of getting supplied from your settlements, by paying for it, with such articles as we can spare, altho' we have but few, having no ammunition to kill game with: and if we had, it seemed dangerous even to hunt, for fear your people should kill us, as they did a party of the Yalley-Town people: we hope through mistake, thinking they were from Chickamogga. Brother, you have been in our Country, and know what a weak, dis- tressed people we are become. Look back and recollect what a numer- ous and warlike people we were, when our assistance were asked against

What are the causes? That war, and succeeding invasions of our Coun- try. You were no nation then. Your Father lived over the Great Water. You claimed the same head, we then did. You now have cast him off, and called him your enemy. The French and Spaniards you call your true friends. We believe they are such, having lately told the Creeks and Chickasas not to hurt you. We are sincerely disposed to call the Head-men of America, our Fathers, your friends ours, wishing for an unsuspecting intercourse, so that we may again be cloathed, and all other benefits renewed— Brother—We suspect the situation of the Eed-people to the South- ward, and particularly that of our nation, is not attended to by your Head-men near the sea-side—Prove yourself our friend in this day of our distress. Let not this "Talk" fall to the ground disregarded, but let it make a deep impression on your mind, and give a full representa- tion of our case to our Fathers, the Head-men of America, who will surely relieve us, as they will be sorry to hear that their children are poor, and naked, and hardly wherein that to subsist. Brother, The Chikasas have American and Spanish Traders among them, who have brought goods in plenty, and every one seems con- tented and in a flourishing way. But we who were foremost in making peace with you are in poverty and distress, which grieves us sorely— In token of our friendship and sincerity, we send you a String of White Wampum— A String— . The message of the Chief of the Chikasas, as delivered by the C^°Py) messenger from the Cherokees— The Great Chief of the Chikasas sent one of his beloved men and Captains to his friends the Cherokees, to acquaint them that he is at perfect peace with the French, Spaniards, and Americans, and that he had now three large stores of goods in his Towns, being brought from Mobile. The Chikasas' messenger was desirous to come in with the glad tidings to the Great Island, had not the news of war between you and us prevented him, but he earnestly requested us to acquaint you of the friendly disposition of his nation to the white people of America, and that as he came through the Upper Creek, he was at a Council that was held there in consequence of an Agent from the Spanish Gov- ernor of West-Florida arriving among them. That he found the Creek Indians were much pleased with the proposals made by the Spaniards, saying they were now going to have their old Father take care of them. The Agent authorized to hold the Treaty, was the same person who was Commandant of the Alabama Fort, when Florida was given up to the English. The Chikasas' messenger was ordered by the Creeks, not to let any of the Chickamogga people know his business, as he passed

You will per- ceive by the enclosed Resolution of that Body, that they view the mat- ter in the same light with your Excellency. I cannot but regret that the rash conduct of an inferior officer has induced your Excellency to entertain an opinion derogatory to the honor of a State which ever wishes to rest upon terms of perfect har- mony & friendship with the Commonwealth of Virginia.

June4th "Sir Our last of the 28th ulto. informed your Excellency fully of the Philadelphia State of news at this place. Since which nothing material has hap- pened, except what the enclosed News Paper contains. There yet remains some doubt relative to the event of the action of the two Fleets in the West Indies. Accounts from Martinique by different channels and of a late date, appearing to render it dubious whether Rodney's letter is spurious or real, we confess however, we have no expectation of its being the former: Yet there is great room to believe that the remainder of the French fleet will form a junction with the Spanish att Cape Francois, and that the combined fleets will have a decided superi- ority in the West Indies, which will enable them to proceed w7ith the Expedition against Jamaica. We find in a Report the Superintendent of Finance has made to Con- gress—the substance of his letter to you on the subject of Stores, and have since had a communication with the Minister of France on that Subject, who informs us he answered your letter to him, relative thereto, and he hopes satisfactorily, but requested us to acquaint your Excell'y "that the misfortune which the Count de Guieheivs Convoy had met with, rendering it very difficult for the Ministry to procure transports for the supply of their own fleets and armies, and to bring out the sup- plies ordered for the United States, he fear'd it would not be practicable to send out those which had been purchased for the State of Virginia in any short time." He gave us to understand that the transfer of the Debt from the State of Virginia to the United States had been a mis- understanding of the Ministry, or some of the under officers & that it 24

The *Count de Beniousky, having renewed to us, an offer which has been made to Congress, and not accepted, as will be seen by the enclosed papers, ISTo. 1. 2. 3. 4 & 5, we thought it a matter of too much conse- quence not to transmit to your Excell'y, which we have done, with copies of all the Papers relative thereto, as above-mentioned, which have been before Congress. It will rest with your Excell'y to consider the propriety of taking the time of the Legislature thereon. The terms offered in the Paper iSTo: 4. refers to those which have been made to Congress, which your Excell'y will see in the Paper No: 1. and an explanation thereof in iSTo: 2, after having been remarked upon by Genl: Washington. We have only to add on this subject, that the gen- tleman who makes the offer does it as an individual. That he is a Polish nobleman and a near relation to the late Count Pulasky—That a part of the Troops he offers and many of the officers (as he informs us) are such as have followed his fortunes in the partition of that Kingdom. That Banish'd from his own Country, he professes a desire to become (with his followers) a citizen of some one of these United States, that he has recommendations from the French Ministry to their Minister here and has had his countenance. The Rejection of his offer to Con- o-ress arose from a doubt in two or three of the States concerning the propriety or policy of their being accepted by Congress. It is our desire that the offer made by him, if not accepted, may be kept as secret as possible, and that the answer thereto may be transmitted through us with all possible expedition, as he will be under a necessity of departing for Europe in the course of three or four weeks from this Date, either to put himself in a state to execute his proposals, oi\%o take other steps with his troops which are now in the Imperial Service, and will shortly be at his own charge—his desire of secrecy and the expedition with which, Mr. Webb informs us he will travel, has induced us to prefer a conveyance by that Gent'n to one by the Post on this occasion. *The name of this officer is spelt "Bieniewsky 11 in Sparks7 Correspondence, where is to be found part only of Genl: Washington's letter dated at New-berg April 27th, 1782, commenting upon & approving the proposition of Count Bien- iewsky. The Delegates enclose herewith a copy of the proposition rejected by Con- gress, to be submitted to the State of Virginia, viz: that he, (Bieniewsky) is to furnish three Legions of foreign troops, amounting in the aggregate to 3483 men, rank and file to serve under the authority of the State as her own troops &c. Accompanying the copies of Bieniewsky's proposition, is a copy of Genl: Washing- ton's letter (JSo. 1.) in full, giving seriatim, his views upon the several heads under which the proposition is expressed. The communication and letter of the Delegates in Congress having been brought before the Executive in Council, they on the 13th June, referred the same to the Genl : Assembly for their consideration. But we find no record of any action having been taken by that Body upon the subject.

If authorized to pay the cost, he will send out persons to collect them, &c. Col: Arthur Campbell to Col: Davies. June5th "Sir Late accounts from Washington and Montgomery Counties confirm Richmond what I apprehended, that the Northern Indians would continue their depredations the whole of the year—I am diffident to propose any scheme for our defence, that might draw from the funds destined for the great objects of the war: however the people expect to be protected, and I make no doubt the Executive will agree with me that the welfare, the existence of a deserving part of the community is an object requir- ing some attention. I would propose that the Commanding officers of Montgomery and Washington may be empowered to order out of their militia, a number not exceeding two hundred men to proceed down Sandy Eiver to a con- venient spot where there may be a Portage, and erect a Fort, leaving about 30 men to garrison it. The others may either act in conjunction with the Kentucky people in making incursions into the Enemies country, or range on both sides of the Sandy Eiver towards the Ohio. Orders for the specifics may be sufficient to supply them.

From reliable sources he is also informed "that the works at the Lead mines are so entirely out of repair" that unless some step is taken to put them in order, or to'purchase lead, not only the western settlements, but "perhaps General Greene's army may be put into a critical situation for want of ammunition."

Ed'wd Randolph to Gov: Harrison. June 15th "Sir Until the present moment, I have been unable from the load of Richmond criminal business, to return an answer to your Excellency on Mr. Andrews' case. By the Constitution the Governor is authorized, "with the advice of the Council of State to grant reprieves or pardons, except when the prosecution shall have been carried on by tbe house of delegates, or the "law shall otherwise particularly direct." So general are these expressions, that were this the only legislative provision on the subject, no scruple could exist concerning your power to pardon in every instance, not falling within the exception.- It would be immeterial too, whether the pardon preceded or followed the conviction. The act however which declares which shall be treason, cuts off your right of pardoning only after conviction, in treason. Mr. Andrews then, not being convicted, and the extensive right to pardon derived from the Constitution, remaining unimpaired before conviction, it follows, that your Excellency may now interpose with the hand of mercy. There was much reason why the legislature should not lop off your otherwise constitutional power of pardoning, before conviction. For the detection of treason frequently depends upon the information of an accomplice, whom it may be necessary to render as unexceptionable as possible in point of testimony, by obviating the objections to which, without a previous pardon, it would be continually exposed on the part of the criminal: who would not fail to urge, and with success too, that he was making court to government for his life by the virulence of his evidence against his accused brother. Besides, altho' it might be improper that the Executive should inter- fere after conviction, that is, after the crime of treason shall have been fixed by a jury, yet every man being in the eye of the Law before trial, innocent, there can be little danger arising from intrusting to the Gov- ernor & Council the power of pardoning before trial. My opinion therefore follows from these observations in favor of your power to pardon Mr. Andrews. 25
Page 194
194 CALENDAR OF STATE PAPEES. 1782. I cannot allow however, that your passport already given, is a dis- Juneloth charge to the sheriff for his failure to bring Mr. Andrews to the court. For it is possible, that at the time of granting it, you were not apprized of his being in custody of the law on suspicion of treason. If so, this would destroy the passport, howsoever broad the words may be, upon the footing of deception. But I do not suppose that the construction of the terms of the passport would admit the idea of its operating as a pardon. The matter being thus reduced to the question of expediency, and this being a political, rather than a legal inquiry, I shall trouble your Excellency no farther, than to assure you, that I am, With great respect yr: mo: ob: Serv't."

The amount extended in the enclosed account, under the head of Quarter master's department, is taken from the books of the state quarter mas- ter, and authenticated by Major Claiborne/' In addition to these amounts he refers "to the specifics collected from the adjacent counties for the supply of the detachments of Continental cavalry in King Wil- liam, the post at Cumberland Old Court House, the post at Peytensburg, and Armand's corps at Charlottesville and Staunton. The supply of these posts and detachments was unavoidable, till the Financier could take the business up, and was directed by your Excellency in Council. I have not been able to procure any return as yet of the amount of these supplies but as the whole business of this kind is now undertaken by contract on Continental account, I hope the persons hitherto employed, will now have sufficient leisure to adjust their accounts."

They had been stimulated to this least they should lose the benefit of their commercial relations with the U. States by a general pacification; which would then bring English goods in competition with their's. They observe also, that the ordinances of Congress against British manufactures, affords a favorably opportunity to introduce those of other countries and that the consequent loss to Great Britian, will induce her to one immediate acquiescence in the freedom of America, and to a general peace. The illicit trade with New York, under the encouragement of the enemy, and the obstruction to foreign trade had seriously impaired the public finances; also from the discovery of supplies of British goods imported under "collusive captures" concerted between vessels from N.

This appears to us at present to be the act of the Ministry in France, but from what motives, or by whose instigation is not clear to us. When it was determined to solicit that loan, we can only find that Congress authorized the Minister of the War department of foreign affairs, and minister of finance, to ask such a supply. We hinted to your Excellency in our last the distressed and critical State of the finances, and the measures which would probably be proposed by Congress in hopes of exciting the States to all the activity and energy they are capable of in that line. We have not been mistaken in our conjecture, and Congress has deenrd speedy exertions of such con- sequence to the well fare of the general cause, that altho' there is but a bare representation left, they have come to a resolution to dispatch two of their members to the Southern, and two to the eastern States charged with an explanation to the Executives and such of the as may be in possession of the true state of our finances and the causes leading thereto. They have also ordered an exact state of the loans, subsidies and moneys received, to be laid before them by the minister of Finance, together writh an acc't of their application. Messrs. Rutledge & Clymore are deputed to the Southern States. Mister Eoot & Mr. Montgomery to the Northward, the latter set off to morrow. Letters from Dr. Franklin so iate as ye 30th March last, inform us that England is weary of ye War—that She appears to want to get out of it if She knew how—that she is nevertheless making useless attempts to withdraw us from france, by secret applications to our Ministers in Europe, at the same time that she is playing the same game by her com- missioners here, and by secret, tho' fruitless application to the Court of france accompanied by great and advantageous offers to that Court which we are informed from another quarter, France has nobly rejected and categorically answerd by declaring she will accept no offer, but the independance of the United States."

July 6th "Sir Your Excellency's Letter of the 15th of June came to hand the Montgomery 21st of that month—I immediately wrote to the Field Officers of Wash- Co* ington and Montgomery to meet me at Montgomery Co. House about forty miles from my house on the 2nd Day of July—They met accord- ingly and proceeded to the business recommended by your Excellency a copy of which I have enclosed. The same Day I issued orders to the officers in this County to raise 100 men under active officers, with the greatest expedition for the relief of the distressed Inhabitants, and at the same time appointed a Person to receive the Specific Tax if any should be brought in &c. Coll: Camp- bell returned to Washington without Loss of time to take the same steps there for the Defence of that Frontier. My declining to undertake the directions of the men to be drawn from Washington did not proceed from any other cause than the great Distance from my House, which is within a mile or two of the Line of Botetourt, to the parts where those men are to do duty, which rendered it impracticable for me to superintend them to any Purpose, so that the Service must have suffered—Colo. Daniel Smith, a very worthy officer who lives on Clinch will be a very proper Person, under Colo. Camp- bell's direction, to have the care of these Troops and there are two Field Officers belonging to this County that live at no great distance from where our militia are to range, whom I have directed to take a particular charge of them. This will not be attended with any expense, and the officers will correspond and Co-operate with each other: there- fore a divided command in this situation & while we act on the defen- sive will not 1 hope, be a Prejudice to the service. Signs of the Enemy are frequently seen in different parts by our Scouts, but there have been no Damage done, since about the middle of June, when two men were killed and three made prisoners in this County. Your Excellency may be assured that nothing in my Power shall be wanting for the defence of the Inhabitants, and in so doing the strictest regard shall be paid to economy. I am your Excellency's most obedient humble Servant."

208 CALENDAR OF STATE PAPEES. 1782. "At a meeting of the Field Officers of the Militia of Montgomery and July 6th Washington Counties, in conformity to instructions received from his Excellency the Governor &c to concert and settle some proper Plan for the Defence of both Counties. Present— Wm. Preston Walter Crockett Joseph Cloyd, Daniel Trigg John Taylor Abraham Trigg Field officers for Montgomery county. Arthur Campbell ^ William Edmonston I ^. -, , ™ « w x ~ Aaron Lewis J-Fieli officers for Washington County. James Dysart J & Major Patrick Lockhart, District Commissioner. It is the unanimous opinion of the Board of officers that the 200 men, permitted to be drawn out by his Excellency the Governor for the defence of the Frontier, be disposed of, into the following Districts, viz— On New River, in the neighborhood of Capt: Paris, 30 men—Sugar Run 20—Capt: Moores', head of Blue Stone 25—Head of Clinch, 25 men— In Washington, at Richland 20—Castle Woods 30—Rye Cove 20— Powell's Valley 30 men. The Extent of the different Districts—From Capt: Paris's to Sugar run 10 miles—to Capt Morris' Head of Blue Stone 30—to Capt: Maxwell's head of Clinch 16 miles, which is nearest the Washington Line. To Richland's 24—to Castle Woods 30—to Rye Cove 28—to Powell's Valley Fort 26 miles—in all 164 miles— We find the greatest difficulty in making any Provision for the sup- port of those men while on Duty, as their is no Specific Tax brought into the Places appointed for that purpose in either of the Counties. The officers have therefore recommended it to Major Lockhart the Dis- trict Commissioner to purchase 200 Bushels of Corn in Montgomery County at the most convenient Places to where the Militia are to do duty, at three shillings per Bushell, being the current Price, and an equal quantity in the County of Washington, for the use of the Troops &c, which we are convinced will be a great saving to the State, as the transporting of grain from Botetourt, where there is some belonging to the Public, on hand, to the several districts where the militia are to do Duty will be attended with very great expence, the distance being from sixty to one hundred and sixty miles &c— As objections have been made to that part of the Governors instruc- tions ordering the direction of the Militia of Both Counties while on Duty, under that of the County Lieut: of Montgomery who lives upwards

Let it therefore be humbly recom- mended to his Excellency the Governor, to alter that part of his Orders, by giving the superintendance of the Troops in each County, to the commanding officers of the same, as it will save the expence of a Field Officer being-on duty, which otherwise would be necessary: and the Defence of the Frontiers will in all probability be better conducted— The Board of Officers are unanimously of the opinion that the Coun- ties of Montgomery and Washington will provide the number of men ordered for their Defence, without calling on any of the neighboring Counties for assistance, unless there is a real occasion to do so, in some Emergency: or on the approach of a large Body of the Enemy. They also beg leave to suggest that the usual manner the Indians con- duct their attacks on our Settlements, makes it necessary that a proper number of Scouts be employed in each District to discover their approaches, for which reason it has induced the Officers to direct that two be employed in each District, for the immediate safety of the Inhabi- tants— Signed by Order— Col: Wm.

I have however put copies of his Excellency's the Governor's Warrant into the hands of two Prudent Officers with directions not to use them unless an absolute necessity, & even then with the greatest caution, so as not to distress individuals. Active popular officers are appointed to command the militia to be called out, with orders to engage the men, if possible, to serve while there is occasion, without drafting or bringing men from other Counties, which last is always attended with an enormous expence & too fre- quently with disorderly Behaviour on the march"— * * % * * * * * * # "I hope I shall stand excused by his Excellency the Governor for not accepting the Superintendency of the militia to be raised in Washing- ton: the distance being so great and the nature of our defence such that 27

Davies. "Sir Essex Co. I rec'd a few days ago your letter of the 28th June, directing one sixth of our militia arm'd and accoutred, to march immediately under the command of proper officers w'th necessary provisions to York Town: in consequence of this order I have directed so many of the militia as will make up the number within a few days to meet in readiness to comply with your request. I cannot however but think his Excellency the Governor and Council when this order was made omitted to attend to the peculiar situation and circumstances of our Country. I there- fore request your fav'r to make particular application to that Hon'ble Board in our behalf. Some considerable time before the surrender of the British Army at York, a very great part of our militia, was in obe- dience to the ord'rs of Government on actual duty and all the Arms, as well as those that belonged to the County, as if private persons were carried with them, and have been never rcturn'd. So that at this time I do not suppose we have a score of good muskets proper for duty within our County. The Hon'ble Board most certainly too must be well acquainted w'th the situation of the County, but least some of the members may not, I beg leave to say that the Eiver Eappa. is for upwards of twenty miles our Eastern Boundary, and affords such depth of water, that the largest ships frequently pass, and have taken in their loads, besides this there are two sets of public warehouses immediately lying on the Banks of the river, in w'h there is alwaj^s considerable quantitys of Tob'o belonging to the Public, as well as to many private individuals. The great number of Familys living very near the Eiver Bank for this distance up the river, without any means of defence against the Cruel and Eapacious Enemy, I should suppose merits par- ticular attention, it must be remember'd that several attemjDts have

Presley Thornton Esqr., at w'h place the Family of Mr. Mottrom Ball lived, and after treating every one in the most outrageous manner, plunder'd & Robb'd the Houses of every thing they came across & God knows the no: of negroes they carried off w'th them, or how soon we may share the same fate, as we hear very frequently that they are commit'g Rob- beries at the mouth of the River & in Piankitank, not more than a few hours sail from us. His Exeell'y the Governor & Council therefore, upon considering our situation, I have no doubt will be pleased to furnish us with a few good musketts &c and direct that our militia should perform duty constantly from the Town of Hobbs' Hole to the lower end of the County w'ch will be more than equivalent to the duty required from the neighboring Countys, at York-Town. We are in want of a number of Commissions immediately for our officers, agreable to the recommendations of our Court, which be pleased to send by Bearer Capt: Thomas Wood, who will furnish you with an account of what are wanting. I sometime ago received a Letter from his ExcelPy the Governor, direct'd to Isaac Smith Esqr., in Richm'd County, Col: Thos. Gaskins & myself, desiring us to obtain a full state of the Capture of the Boston Schoon'r by the crew in the Yessel in w'ch Col: John Webb was inter- ested, and to take depositions. The original Letter I immediately sent to Mr. Smith & Col: Gaskins & wrote to them to meet me at last Essex Court to take proper steps to do this Business, but Mr. Smith's being up the Country prevented our meeting: however as I have just received an answer from him, I fully expect veiy shortly it may be in our power to proceed therein, altho' he mentions in his Letter that a Capt: Abra- ham Outtan & his Barge's crew on the Eastern (Shore) ought to be examined as witnesses in the occasion <fc it will not be within our power to do that part"—- "Should His Excell'y & Council think proper to order a few arms &e for us agreable to my request, they may be assured that the greatest care shall be taken off them & in the case of actual Invasion, that our militia will at all times most readily fly to the assistance of their Brother Citizens.

CALENDAR OF STATE PAPEES. 213 Col: Arthur Campbell to Col: Wm. Davies. 1782. "Sir July 10th Before this reaches you, no doubt }-ou will have received from Col: Washington Preston, the result of the Council of officers directed to be held by the Executive, to which I beg leave to refer. There has been no disturbance in this County for several weeks past, from the Northward Indians. It is conjectured Col: Crawford's move- ment over the Ohio may have drawn their attention. They effects his disaster may produce, it is to be feared they frontiers will feel this summer yet. Our small settlement in Powell's Yalley has been much harrassed by small parties of the Cherokees from the Chickamogga Towns. They not long since killed two men, and has most ruined the inhabitants by destroying or carrying off their stock. Capt: Samuel Jewell an active young officer that lives there, has had the good fortune to overtake two of their parties, one about forty miles below the Cuttawa, or Cumber- land Gap, fired on the Indians in Camp, wounded some and retook every thing. The other party was overtaken when asleep, one killed and another wounded, they rascals had to make the best of their way home naked. I understand that these Indians (are) with some rene- gade Tories, ruined Indian Traders may most probably be deemed a selection of Thieves at Chickamogga, than a national enemy. The chiefs of the nation protesting against their measures and wishes we may cut them off. A matter, something disgraceful, happened lately between us and that nation. Two friendly young Indian men was coming up the Hol- stein with a canoe loaded with peltry for Colo. Martin, was killed pri- vately near the Long Island by two villians, who in attempting to make sale of the skins, was detected and they goods reclaimed, but the inhabitants would not suffer the criminals to be brought to justice, alledging against the nation in general the late depredations on the frontiers. Colo. Martin sent an express to the Towns giving an account of the accident. The Chiefs returned for answer that they believed his relation of the matter, and were willing to hold us b}^ the hand as Brothers yet. I hope this matter will end here, altho' the promises of Chiefs has little influence with the relations of the murdered, anions Indians, if an opportunity offers to take private revenge. This outrage was committed by two citizens of N. Carolina, Their Government is so badly organized, so feebly administered, or perhaps from the local situation of that part of the State, that there is no bring- ing culprits to justice. Besides, I observe a jealousy of Virginia in assuming the whole agency with the Indians and a monopoly of the Trade. Perhaps this is such a national concern that it may be best accommodated by Regulations of Congress. For I doubt whether Carolina would be competent to the task were it relinquished in their favour.

I am sorry to hear that the Goods ordered from the public Store July 10th should be stopt, especially as the Governor's Letter and answer to the Indian Talks is gone foward, which if not fulfil'd will make us look little in the eyes of the Indians, and will give the enemies emissaries amongst the Indians a handle against us. The County shirts (if all received) would be but a partial supply; besides European goods if of an inferior quality are more pleasing to Indians than homespun. I should not be so importunate on this subject were it not that I have understood that Genl: Green has expectations that thro' the management of the Commissioners he appointed, they indians may be armed and kept quiet, or so dividing as not to answer the wishes of the enemy in making a diversion on the frontiers of the South incase he should be pressed by the enemy from Charlestown.

As Col: Preston refuses the direction of the Militia on Duty in this County I wish to receive orders expressing the will of the Executive on that Subject." July 10th Capt: II.

Mr. Yarbough informs him there are about 200 Beeves in his district, a large quantity of flour "and 1800 bushels of wheat" but not a farthing of money. He has not even money to pay his current expenses, and indeed has a charge against the state of five pounds. If all the Districts are in this condition "the case will be desperate." He will cross the Eiver at Cabbin Point to Jas: City7 Co., continuing his efforts and will give further accounts. Has engaged a vessel at Petersburg to take flour to the College Landing, as it is not safe to venture round to York by water. His wagons will transport the provisions from the Landing to the Garrison at York.

July 13th Middlesex That having received two orders from the Commissioner of War "to Cw* hold in perfect readiness one fouth of the Militia" and "one sixth properly accoutred and officered, to march to Yorktown," he takes the liberty to inform his Excellency of the peculiar situation of that County, and he believes that instead of drawing men from them, assistance should be sent to defend the county against the barges and Privateers of the enemy, and from "the ravages of a plundering set, whose cruel- ties no man can judge of who has not felt them." He begs that two Posts be established; one at "Pine Top" at the end of the Peninsular towards the Ches: Bay, the other at Urbanna, which alone could give security to the people. Gives an instance of a Privateer schooner and two barges, that had been for several days, in and about the mouths of the Rappahannock and Pianakitank Rivers, capturing by water, and landing, and robbing the inhabitants "of their all." He adds, that during the past year when the army was in that neighborhood, fifty or sixty guns were impressed from the inhabitants, thus depriving them of the means of defence, and begs the county may be supplied with public arms in place ol those as soon as convenient.

Sir Guy Carleton is so desirous of retreiving the soldiers we have taken, that he offers, if we will exchange them for seamen, to stipulate that they shall not serve against the United States during twelve months.

War Office "As the houses at the "Point of Fork" are now ready for the recep- tion of artificers, and some of them are already there, I submit to your Excellency whether some person should not be appointed to take charge of them. The armorers that were with Mr. Anderson, the taylors and shoe-makers that were at Albemarle Barracks, and the several persons, employed in the Laboratory, will assemble at that place in the course of a month. The arms from New Castle, and other places are daily going up, and the management of the people and the care of the public stores, which will arrive there, requires the appointment of a person of author- ity, application and experience. This appointment may be made too, with a real diminution of expense. I hope I shall not be presuming, by intimating an opinion that there are some persons employed in the several Staff Departments in the State, than the present situation of our affairs seem to require" etc. Should his Excellency require a return etc" of these, he will find the statement made above to be true. He is therefore convinced, that the appointment of one judicious and atten- tive person, would be sufficient to superintend the entire business of the Place, and recommends Capt: John Peyton for this office—The "gun- work" could be done at Fredericksburg by Mr. Dick—As Mr. Anderson has positiveljT refused to do any more work for the State, he desires instructions as to whether this refusal shall be allowed &c.

When they removed to York he came with them. When York was captured he went up to Baltimore, lie never took an oath on either side, those inhabitants that staid in York with the British tell me he appeared much at his liberty while the British were here, & that he came to York about three weeks before the British removed from Portsmouth, and after a few days retnrn'd to Portsm'th.

Mr. Robertson has not yet arriv'd at this place, tho' he informs me from York he has large supplies coming in, and will be here shortly. I will inform your Excellency as soon as I can have an opportunity of going to York, my opinion of the Situation of the Barracks, and what addition will be necessary to make them fit for the reception of five hundred men. The scheme for employing the Soldiery to work on them I think a very good one. Agreeable to your directions, I sent to employ Mr. Hobday to trans- port the Cavalry over to the Eastern Shore, but am inform'd he is gone up York River in a vessel and will not return in some time.

If you should not be able to get any vessels at the head of Elk, you will in that case proceed to Baltimore and charter the vessels there—you will get them on the best terms possible, engaging their pay as soon as their, freight is discharged. I suppose you must ensure the vessels—you will not suffer a question of that kind to delay you one moment. I imagine there will not be any great risque, for there will be, if the stores are loaded in time, a 44 gun ship to convoy them. If you find it necessary, you will apply to the Commanding Officer of the militia to put on board each vessel twenty or thirty men, which number will be sufficient to defend her against the small boats. Should they be attacked by large vessels they must attempt to run her on shore—the men may prevent her being burnt, and the Ordnance and Stores from being destroyed. When you arrive at York Town, you will apply to the Qr. Mr. there, for his assistance in removing the stores to the landing—I suppose they are on the ground where we left them—if they should have been removed the trouble of doing it will be saved— There were a great many shot left at different places—many were lying on the shore below the british work, which we took from them before the surrender. You will apply to the Commanding Officer of the militia to give you all the aid you ma}' want in collecting and loading the Stores, so that it may be done with so much dispatch as to permit you to sail with the french, and take the advantage of their convoy—Without fail send off with them such vessels as shall be loaded—let, therefore, as they are the most valuable, the cannon be put first on board. There were left a great number of waggon carriages and wheels—if they are not sold7 bring as many of the best wheels as you can, and sell the remainder—bring all the gun carriages you can pick up. You will particularly inquire what quantity of powder and fixed ammu'n was left—let that also be secured as soon as may be. You will herewith receive 300 dollars to refund the expence of collecting and loading the stores &c, for which sum you wi 11 be accountable. In chartering of vessels you will jDrocure such only as can come up to the head of Elk. There will be a number of french troops and artillery men at York. I think you will obtain very considerable aid from them if you apply for it. You will, I suppose, find a civil magistrate in York—Should 'there be one, you will wait upon him and request his assistance if you should Avant it—he will be of use to you in collecting the teams, provided the people should be averse to the removal of the ordnance. 29

Mr. Eobcrtson, being about to leave York, he urges the appointment of "one John Crawford" to do the duties of Commissary; "a man most singularly esteemed by the officers and men," on account of his faithful services, and successful efforts in feeding the troops in their great distresses.

"Sir War Office Agreeable to the order in Council of the 18th, I beg leave to inform your Excellency that a number of public arms were delivered last sum- mer to Sir John Peyton by order of Gov: Nelson. This was done with- out the intervention of myself or the Commissary of Military Stores: so that I am wholly unable to ascertain the number. It is probable some entry may be made of it, in some of the Council books. The arms are in store, which were left at the seige of York: no doubt there are many private ones among them, which might be separated, and upon proof the property returned to the owners: tho' the fact is, that the militia on the Gloucester side went off after the seige was over, and left their arms stocked upon the ground. Many of the private arms therefore belonging to the County of Gloucester are probably among those that were brought up from below, and lodged at ]STew Castle.

July 25th "Sir, I have had the honor of your letter of the 23d June, and thank you Head for your assurances of affording me all the support in your power. Ashly "k/vc Genl: Muhlenberg writes, the state has agreed to raise three thousand men. The mode is not mentioned. I wish it may be successful, but 1 have my fears if the plan is founded on that fatal policy of appearing strong on paper, or only showing a disposition to do as much as the other states, without intending it should have efficacy and success, which has been too much the spirit of politics in all the states—I say, should this be the spirit and tenu of the Law, which I hope is not the case, it will only serve to feed our expectations, without affording that substantial support, which is necessary to free ourselves, from the far- ther ravages of the enemy. I was sorry to hear lately, that Virginia had departed from the plan, recommended by Congress for obtaining a revenue by tax for the support of the war. Nothing more wanting than a spirit of union among the states, and every little deviation, even in the mode of doing business, from what is recommended by Congress, tends to weaken and defeat the measures taken for national security. And more especially, when this happens in one the first states in the union, whose example others copy with pride and confidence, in full persuasion of its being perfectly right. Great part of the calamities felt by the United Provinces, was owing to a want of proper spirit of union, and the independent measures which each took for their own security, without regard to the general safety of the whole, and great
Page 230
230 CALENDAK OF STATE PAPEES. 1782. part of the evils which we have felt, and the only remaining hopes, July 25th which the enemy have had for a long time, is that a want of a spirit of union among ourselves, might render our opposition, ineffectual in time. Nothing has given me more pain, than the opposition I hear was given in your house of Assembly, to the plans of the Financier, to give credit to public measures with the people. Upon what principle the circulation of his notes, was opposed, I cannot imagine. The measure is highly important in a political light, as it appears to be one of the few means left to keep the wheels of government in motion—In a com- mercial point of view it must be highly beneficial to the state, for it is certainly calculated to leave among them the little specie in circulation, and to afford a medium to increase commerce, and inspire industry. In m}r opinion, the opposition was ill-judged, to say no worse of it— It is reported here also, that the state is going to keep up a Garrison of 1000 militia at York and Gloucester. I cannot help thinking they will find the expence far greater, than the advantage. The expense and the risque are the only criterion, to decide upon the propriety and policy of the measure. The force is either too great, or too small. If it is intended to check little incursions only, the force is too large: if to oppose a serious invasion, too small. While we weaken our force, with divided measures, we shall burthen ourselves with a useless expence, and after all be open to the inroads of sudden incursions. I do not know the particular object of this body of militia, but suppose they are called out, to supply the place of the French troops, who, I am told have marched from Virginia northerly. Be it what it may, I think a little time will convince }tou, that the benefits are far less, than the charge and trouble attending it, to say nothing of the inconveniences which will be felt in the continental measures from the states wasting its resources in attempting local security. Savannah is evacuated, but the enemy must be driven from Charles- town by force, and this we have little prospect of being able to effect, without greater exertions than I can flatter myself with— I have the honor to be with great respect, Your Excellency's &c &c— July 25th A Return of the Staff Departments of the State, with their pay, rations, & Forage extended in specie— Quarter Master's Department.

Col: Wilson informs me he has repeatedly applied for provision to Col: Harrison of Eockingham, but have Eec'l but very trifling, the militia from Frederick, Berkley & Shanandoah I expect will be here soon, and no provision for them nor none to be had. I hope your Honour will take it under consideration and adapt some mode for our relief, particularly in that of provision and how and what manner the men are to be supported. I could git Beef & flour by impressing, but we have* no salt, and that of taking people's property I am very loath to undertake, could any other method be adopted. I have made the strictest enquiry concerning the murder commited on Muskindom, and find only one man that went from this county & since, he is dead— About the twentieth of May last Colo. Wm. Crawford, with five hun- dred men went against St. Duskey (Sandusky) and a few miles from the town the Enemy met them, and from the best accounts our loss were not less than 100 men. Colo. Crawford himself taken and Colo. Wm. Harrison with many others, by a prisoner who were taken at the time and made his escape, informs he saw Colo. Crawford tied to a stake and burnt, and by one other prisoner who has since come in, says, he saw Colo. Harrison Quartered and burnt. Since that the enemy attacked hannah's Town in Westmoreland count}7, Idled a great number of the inhabitants and burnt the town. Yesterday I was creditably informed that the Enemy had burnt Fort Henry at the mouth of Wheeling, but I do not assert it, though I have reason to believe it is true. These instances causes our Frontiers to be very ticklish, as we are so scattering, the small settlements so great a distance apart. I received a line from your honour dated 9th of May concerning men being inrold. who lived in forts. I can assure your honour that since I have had the Honour of commanding the county such a practice have never been allowed. Upon the Whole I submit to your honours Superior Judgment hoping that this part of the State will not be allowed to fall a prey to so barbarous an Enemy as those Savages— and am with the greatest Esteem your Excellencies most Obedt.

"Last night Ellis Harland (a noted Indian Trader of great influence among ye Indians) returned from the nation, who informs that the Chickamogga Indians are desirous for peace, that they were to set out for Chota with the Prisoners the day he left there, that Springston (a Linguister) is there waiting arrival, at which time be is to come for me to go and receive them. I expect him every hour. Harlin has brought a large quantity of Wampum and Talks in with him, but being sick, is not able to give them out otherwise I should send them to you. The old warrier O'Kana—Stotee has sent to me informing that he has resigned his authority; with the consent of the whole nation to his son Tuckasee (he is the man that went down with Col: Gist some years past commander of the party) and desires that I will attend at Chota to assist at the ceremony of his installation, in the name of Virginia.

Should your Excellency disapprove of such measures in a sister State, of which not only we, but the Union may be interested, your repre- sentation and influence, no doubt, will procure such a revision of the Order of North Carolina as may alter its most exceptionable parts.

Colo. Crafford he saw Tyed & Burning nearly two houres & behaved like a hero. The Trator Simon Girty was standing by. The Colo. Cryed out to him no mercy, only shoot me, which his Reply was, "Crafford I have no gun" with a laugh, "how can you expect any other—this in Retalation for the meravins (mora- vians) that was murdered last Spring." the Colo, made no reply, nor was heard to make any noys the whole time of his Tautor—after about two hours he fell on his face, one of the waraurs (warriors) jumpt in & Scalped him & throughed up hot coles & ashes on him, & then the Colo, got up & walked; & then the Doctor sd: he was taken away & told he was not to be burnt there, but was to be taken to the Shaynee Towns, where there was about Thirty Duliways (Delawares) lived to give them some satisfaction for the murder of the meravins, and on his way he made his Escape, was 21 days coming in to Fort Pitt & his subsistance the whole time was green goos bearys, nettle tops & green may apples— One Slover has made his Escape about twelve days since the Doctor, & gives an account of all the Prisoners that was taken, was put to death, that Colo.

Any payments which the several states may think Proper to make, or any expenditures for Cloating or the like cannot be admitted in deduction from the Quota Assigned them—It becomes necessary trom many reasons, which I will not trouble your Excellency with ye enumeration of, that nothing be received from the States but money, this alone can prevent those intri- cate accounts which hitherto have involved every thing in a Labarinth of Confusion.

239 The Quarter Master's duties are greatly"circumscribed, to what they 1782. were during the Invasion, nor does his business much exceed that of a July 30th Continental Assistant Deputy Quartermaster at a Post: especially as he has, exclusive of other Assistants, a Forage Master, waggon master and Hostler under him, which the assistant Deputy, to the best of my recol- lection, was not allowed to have, and was obliged to act as Commissary to the Post, besides— The Assistant Quarter Master seems wholly unnecessary in the pres- ent state of affairs, especially when it is observed, that by the present establishment of the Quarter Master's Department, which your Excel- lency may choose to see, the Quarter Master General is allowed to employ as many Clerks as may be wanting, at a much cheaper rate, who might be equally competent for the business of keeping the accounts. This post of Assistant Quarter master has been reduced in the Conti- nental establishment, where it was infinite^ more necessary than it possibly can be here. The Deputy Quarter Master has been dispenced with for more than a month, as I thought him unnecessary in our circumstances; and the person resigning, who held that Post, it has not been tilled up since, but the appointment still remains as part of the present establishment. If a comparison is made with the Clerks and Assistant Clerks in other offices, those emplo}'ed in the Quarter Master's department appear to be particularly favored as to their allowances, tho' their duties are con- fessedly no greater than those of the others. The Commissary of Military Stores tho' veiy necessary in times of Invasion, does not appear to be absolutely necessary at other times; at least the person with the pay of the Assistant, would be sufficient for the business under the same direction of the war office as at present. It might perhaps be well enough, if the appointment of Commissary General of Military Stores was, like that of the General officers, to take take place, only in times of Invasion. Such is the case of the appoint- ment of the Adjutant Genl: of the militia and some other great staff appointments. The Hospital department is and ever will be, very circumscribed in its duties in times of tranquility like the present. Half a dozen patients at Richmond, with the charge of sending down medicines and hospital Stores to Colo. Dabney, are almost the only object of a Physician and Director General's care. If there was a necessity for a medical officer of that dignity any where at present, it would seem that York or Hampton should be the place; but even there it is not necessary. Regimental & occasional Surgeons will be fully sufficient for the present numbers in Service. An apothecary would probably answer every purpose of a Director General, as the duties must always be very trifling, except in an Invasion, when a person might be employed with a handsome allow- ance for the services actually performed; which would be equally useful and much more economical than the present establishment.

Quarter master's & Military Stores departments were not made receivable in Taxes, as was the case with the Hospital and many others; perhaps therefore should your Excellency be of opinion that any abatement or alteration of their allowances should finally take place, yet you might also judge it proper that to the end of the present quarter, the present establishment should be continued, and that any new regulations which your Excellency may think necessary to order should not take place before October next. On this occasion I confide entirely on the indulgence of your Excel- lency, if I presume to suggest to you the necessity of appointing some person to settle the various accounts of quartermast'rs. Commissaries, Commissioners & Contractors &c, both past and to come. This is a business of so much importance, that without it there can never be an expectation of Justice being done the Country. A Quartermaster or a Commissary draws large sums of money from the Treasury; Six or eight months afterwards he settles with the Audi- tors, proving by his vouchers that he has laid the whole money out in horses, cattle, waggons, or anything else: but here the enquiry ends, tho' it is evidently a matter of as much moment to the Public, to know what has been done with the horses, cattle &c, as it was with respect to the application of the money. For want of such an appointment infi- nite abuses have been committed. None of Finney's, Porterfield's, Brown's or Pierce's Accounts of Stores and Issues have been, or ever will be settled, altho' they all may have got a quietus from the Auditor's, as to the money they received—Thus, Captain Young regularly makes his quarterly settlements with the Auditors, and the exact sum of mone}^ he has laid out is ascertained, but as to the application of his purchases, it rests solely with himself. This is a circumstance I know, he thinks highly improper and would be glad to see remedied—This appointment is necessary also as a preparative to the settlement of the Continental account, and more immediately for settling with the Dis- trict Commissioners and with Mr. Eobei^tson. I do not conceive it within the duties, or Lieusure of my Office to undertake any of this business. It appears to me improper that the same person should have the power of disposing of the Public Stores and settling the Accounts. He might dispose of them for his own pur- poses with security- Should your Excellency concur in sentiment as to the propriety of this appointment and the reduction of the Post of Assistant Quarter Master, I should think it an act of Justice due to Capt: Jones, the present Assistant, to recommend him to the favorable attention of your Excel- lency, as a 2>ei>son whose experience in Military arrangements, and whose knowledge of Accounts render him every way proper to be employed. As to the Quarter Masters Accounts for the last year,

July 30th I now beg leave to refer your Excellency to the letter I had the honor to address to you on the 17th, relative to the situation of the Point of Fork. It becomes daily more necessary that some regulations should be taken respecting that Post, and Captain Peyton has been waiting some time for the ultimate determination of government. I beg your Excellency's pardon for the length of this letter, which I hope may be so far confidential as not to expose me to the Ill-will of the Gentlemen in the departments of which I have spoken. No person has a more exalted opinion of their abilities and virtues than I have: They were of my own recommendation almost to a man, and the persons of whom of all others I would chuse. I am governed wholly by a regard to the Public interest in the representations I have made, and have the honor to be, with the highest respect Tour Excellency's Most Obed't and very humble Servant." Petition of Josiah Cantz a citizen of Georgia, to the Governor July 30th of Ya. Praying to be allowed the benefit of the Law in regard to registering Powhatan slaves on the part of persons coming into the State with such property— He had failed through the absence of the ClerJ^-of the County in the ... militia, and the neglect of the-'Bisfcfiet Judge^to register his slaves, when, being driven out of Georgia, he had come to Virginia—He also prays for permission to sell two slaves to discharge certain debts incurred, as his purpose is to return to his home in the south at once.

Genl: Green's difficulties and misfortunes had prevented his receiving any funds for paying off his Army up to this date—This rendered their own condition very uncomfortable, especially with the sickness arising out of the fatigues and exposures of the campaign in Georgia.

In view of all the circumstances, the sufferings of the officers, their distance from home, and this being their only dependanee for support, he appeals to the Executive of a state that heretofore never disregarded the wants of her troops, when it was possible to supply them, to take steps to deliver the above amount of Tobacco as required, to be deducted afterwards from the pay of the officers. Having become responsible for its delivery his honor is at stake; and if it can be done in no other way, he suggests that the Gov- ernment issue certificates in favor of the officers for the amount of tobacco, made receivable with the Planters. Capts: Scott and Parker , are charged with the duty of waiting on his Excellency in this matter. If money could be sent out to him at once, almost all the eighteen months' men whose times expire in September, would engage for the war.

"May it please your Excellency Tappahan- I think it my duty to acquaint you that nock Essex a spirit prevails on this River, which if not averted to must be attended with dangerous & ruinous consequences to the State; for if I am not supported in the Authority of my office, Government must fall short of their expectations in the Revenue proposed from the collection of Duties on imported Goods and Tonnage. Your Excellency may remember that I laid before you on Sunday last certain letters &c. which I had taken from the Flag Brig Charming Jenny, in consequence of our Information on suspicion that British Goods had been imported—in my pursuit after this Brig, I met with a Schooner at Fredericksburg from Maryland, laden with Salt, having in the first instance obtain'd from the office in Maryland a permit to go only to Baltimore, and came here. She then passed the office on Rappa'nk and had sold a part of her Salt. Having found from exj^erience long ago, the only way to do the Publick Justice, would and must be, a Strict & Impartial Execution of my Duty, and knowing the Maryland craft to

As one Shelton, in whom I could confide, was there, I gave him the care of the Vessel and Sails. This, joined with (what they term) my assurance in searching the flag, incensed the people of Fredericksburg to such a Degree, that a mob was instantly raised, and theJSails taken from on board the Sloop, by violence. Luckily for Shelton he was not on board, or him they would have either murdered or treated badly, but the former its said was resolved on. The ring Leaders, it is hinted, were men of note in Fredericksburg (Mr. William Harvey merch't & Mr. Samuel Kocldey merct. & Alderman of the Town), in the cellar of the latter it is said the Salt is stored—however of this we have no Proof—One Bingy, a Ship Carpenter was unwillingly led into this measure & Capt: Shelton says, confesses himself one of the mob—I would on information of the Salt's being in Eoddey's warehouse, have gone and searched it, but salt is of such a nature that no discovery could have been made from its peculiarity, therefore I think it better to wait for better Authority, being determined to hazard every thing to have the Law enforced, but the mercantile Interest is so great on this Eiver, that every effort proves ineffectual— I am Your Excellency's most obed't and very humble servant."

After this a deputation of Chiefs was to attend any where, and the whole nation was prepared to make peace on any terms. The Commission appointed by Genl: Green, might receive the Prisoners, and hold " Talks," but in view of the approaching "treaty" some expense must be incurred; and it might be wise to order the Chiefs to Eichmond, He is particularly "anxious about this business" as an opportunity is now offoured, by which not only future quiet is to be established from that powerful Tribe, but they may be made serviceable to American interests by their trade and assistance—To secure this he recommends that the goods promised be forwarded with despatch, with which to begin trade with the nation—The arrival of Capt: Looney had inspired every one with confidence in the sincerity of the Indians, and would most probably induce the Carolinians to abandon their expedition.

Surely the importation of british subjects, if they be designated by the term "enemies" was an offence in the flag, unless there should be some apology for so doing, not communicated to me. S But I know not any punishment, pecuniary or corporal, denounced against such an act. These british subjects indeed, if unauthorized to return to Virginia, may be treated, I presume as enemies. But if by the term "enemies" be meant, persons suspected of treason, it seems allowable, that a flag may bring them to the country. They are citizens supposed to be innocent until conviction, and are at liberty to risque themseves upon a trial for life or death. It would sound

If proper enquiries be made, it will be found that Hart unjustly retains possession of the property, which of right should escheat to the State.

Neither the change of Ministry nor the passive conduct of the Enemy- August 12th ought to induce a relaxation of our exertions at this important crisis:— bold and decissive measures will destroy the hopes of conquest, and in a little time will secure and establish that freedom for which we have been so long struggling. On the other hand, inattention and supine- ness, if they should gain the ascendency, will inevitably destroy our prospects, and ruin our hopes. The present moment is precious to our views if properly improved:—to secure a peace we must prepare for war. A variety of circustances concur to induce a belief that the Enemy will evacuate this Country in the course of a few weeks. Great prepara- tions are making at Charlestown, a number of transports have arrived, and many of the Adherents to the British Government are about to imigrate to East Florida. Desertion prevails very much among the Enemy, and a general dis- content has taken place among the Tory Party. A proclamation has been issued by order of Genl: Leslie, desiring such as chose to go to St. Augustine to give in their names and all others who wished to depart to any particular place in the Country or else where, to make their inten- tions known, that steps may be taken to accommodate their views and wishes:—at the same time asserting the expected evacuation of this Country. Should this happy event take place, it will be an important advantage to all the Southern States; they have long groaned under the weight of oppression, and have suffered as much as they can well bear. With sentiments of the highest esteem and respect, I have the honor to be, Your Excellency's most obedient and most humble Servant."

CALEKDAK OF STATE PAPERS. 259 No material event has taken place, since we bad the honor of writing 1782. to your Excell'y by Express, when we informed you of a letter received August 13th from Sir Guy Carleton and Admiral Digby directed to Genl: Washing- ton, containing information uthat Mr. Grenville was actually commis- sion'd as plenipo: for adjusting a Plan of a Peace with the Belligerent powers, and was actually at Paris when the packet sail'd—and that the King of great Britain had order'd his ministers to instruct him to offer Independency to the thirteen Provinces in the first Instance, and not as a condition of the treaty—relying however with confidence that the Property of the Loyalists would be restored to them in America." Congress had order'd this letter to be published with their sense on its contents—which we hope to have the pleasure of transmitting to your Excell'y in the Paper we shall herewith enclose. What may be the Issue of the negotiation for a Peace, which we have every reason to believe is now on the Tapis, we will not venture to pre- dict, But wre cannot help thinking that the Preliminary offer above men- tioned, however it may be intended by England, will have a favorable effect on our affairs, as it seems to remove the Principal Barrier, which has hitherto prevented some of the powers of Europe from recognizing us as an Independent nation—viz, the apprehension of giving umbrage to England, by such an interferance whereby they w'd have departed from their neutral & mediatorial characters. We are Inform'd that a great confusion prevail'd among the Tories within the Enemies' lines, immediately on the news above-mention'd transpiring, and it is not improbable but that the ferment it has occa- sion'd among them, may end in measures by no means advantageous to our Enemies. The American Army continues at its former station—the French at Baltimore, and the F. Fleet under the command of the M. de Vaudviel off this Coast, where he waits to protect the Trade, and to afford a Convoy to such vessels as may be ready to sail in a short time, of which your Excell'y has no doubt been apprised by the French Admiral. It is with pleasure we inform your Excell'y, that an attrocious and dangerous band of robbers, some of whom have been concerned in rob- bing the two last mails that were taken and in various other enormi- ties—have been secured in this and the neighboring States, to the amount of above thirty and are now in close Goals, this we hope will give security in future to communications, as 'tis said nearly the whole of those concerned, who formed a line from 1ST. York to Maryland have been discover'd and taken. We doubt not of your Excelly's having received satisfactory accounts of the evacuation of Savannah, of which Congress receiv'd yesterday Authentic information—we have the Honor, to be yr: Excelly's most obed't & very Humb: Servts" P. S.—Since writing the above, find the publication therein mention'd is not yet in the Paper, but shall endeavor to procure copy of it.

I also made the same request to the officer, who commanded the militia in York Town.

The post will be well supplied until his return from the Northern Neck, to which place he goes at once.

Several of these gentlemen are at home, and why a Surgeon should, under those circumstances be appointed to a regiment that exists only in name, is more than I can account for, especially a person, who has been so lately, and I think unnecessarily appointed a mate. I would therefore ask your Excellency's orders, whether an appointment of Surgeon shall be made out for Mr. Yates to the 8th Regt., or that Genl: Muhlenberg be informed that Congress have direc- ted a reduction of regiments to take place, and that it is expensive and inexpedient to appoint persons to be officers, who must immediately become supernumerarys."

This violent & flagrant Breach of the Peace by a military man & his subsequent opposition to the civil Power, the magistracy of Wmsburg have considered as of too dangerous Tendency to be passed over, without further notice, & have therefore transmitted this State of Facts to your Excellency, that the Executive may adopt such mode, as to them may seem best, to compel the officer to be amenable for his Conduct.

Col: McDowell had already corresponded with him to the same effect. At least £25 to £30, each, for actual expences, and a sufficiency to purchase "Baggage-horse & furniture." "1 Blank Book, 1 Beam writing paper, 3 papers Ink-powder, 1 Box wafers, 2 lbs. Tea & 25 Coffey, 50 lbs Brown & 15 lbs Loaf Sugar" will be neaded. The money to purchase the horses &c. should be forwarded to each gentleman, so that he may use his best judgement in the matter.

He has only received from Chas: Dick of Fredericksburg thirty muskets and six hundred cartriges, in accordance with orders from the War Office—Wishes double that number could have been sent, in as much as it is necessary to keep a proper guard over the public Tobacco and Provisions, and for the inhabi- tants exposed along the Eiver. The militia of Essex have on all occa- sions been so willing and prompt when called upon, that the few invalid delinquents in the county, were really "below our attention"— Wm. Hat, C.

The Twenty fifth, five Hundred of the Lincoln militia commanded by Colo.

Forty seven of our Brave Ivanetuckians were found in the field, the matchless massacraed victims of their unprecedented Cruelty—We are led to conceive that none were captivated, from a number found at the crossing of the Creek tied & Butchered with knives & spears.

One remark- able occurrance in this era, was, on Col: Christian's reaching the Towns on the Tennessee in 1776 a certain Cherokee chief, called the ''Dragging Canoe" a "Cheuconnasee," seceded from the national councils of the Cherokees, drew off large numbers, and retired down the River, to a place called Choccomogga, near the Whirl in the Cherokee River made new settlements, and gave an asylum to the British Agent and a num- ber of Renegade Tories: continuing his depredations by small parties, drawing to h^'^i^U^^i^k^' rp§v$p$jl$^.^. jk^.-^wng ;men of ye Towns, who h;a#^^ combination-of: tKes^i^ Col: Brown, the Enemy's Agent: but th is happily wa"S broken- :<6yr'ihb' defeat they met with, from Col: Arthur Campbell and others. Their country was desolated as far south as the Hiwasee River. The hither Towns' people fled mostly into the mountains for shelter, and soon after made peace. The seceding party fled either, below the "Whirl," or to the sources of the Mobile. It is from these Towns, together with large accessions of Tories, that Carolina and Georgia have received so much annoyance since our recovery of'those states—A view of Hutehin's late map, will enable you better to comprehend what I have said— As to present Intelligence: by a letter I lately received fromGenl: Pickens, who lives on the frontiers of So. Carolina, adjoining Georgia, I am applyed to, for to co-operate with him in attacking the unfriendly Cherokee Towns, and am told at the same time, that Governor Mathews has wrote to our Executive on the subject; but as the Governor's letter of the same date with yours, mention nothing of it, I consider myself not at liberty to comply with the request: besides, the overtures made by these same Indians for peace, and in some measure countenanced by Mr. Martin, our Agent, renders it still more improper, as I apprehend the Indians wish to engage us to act as mediators—In the month of July, before the evacuation of Savannah, Col: Brown the British Agent, essayed to conduct from thence a considerable supply of goods and ammunition, to his adherents in the Cherokee Country. The whole was fortunately intercepted, and he himself, narrowly escaped by flight—A short time after, as an Escort, was coming down to meet Brown, (not hearing of his fate) they were met by Genl: Clark, of Georgia, near the frontiers of Georgia, and totally defeated—Several Indians and Tories

About ten days ago, the northward Indians killed two men in this count}', the party that did this mischief, did not exceed half a dozen, and could not be traced, so as to overtake them. This is the only onset, we have had since the Spring. Col: Crawford's exertions, no doubt overthrew their boasted scheme of annoy- ing the frontier; and I trust Genl: Irvine's good fortune will give us but little to fear from that quarter, after this campaign.

The Propriety of this measure will be more apparent to your Excel- lency & the Council, when it is observed that there is too great reason to suspect that the soldiery of the present Guard have been either prin- cipals or accessaries in almost every robbery which has of late been committed among us, and that their licentiousness & ungovernable con- duct is such as to endanger, even in the day time, the persons & prop- erty of the Inhabitants in the vicinity of the Jail.

Should your Excellency with the Honorable Council, think Proper that sume step should be taken with these People, and would wish to appoint Commissioners in this quarter for that purpose, I will mention the fol- lowing Gents: who in my opinion are the most fit men amongst us for that Purpose, Col.

Its true, some of our young fellows has Stole some of your Horses, but still they never went of themselves, their was other Nations, Creeks, Cherokees, Wanpunockys &c, who Led them out, and what Damage was done, was by reason you settled a Fort in our Hunt- ing ground without our leave, And at that place you suffered most from us.

We were met by about 25 men, who informed—of a total defeat at the Big Blue Licks on Licking. I covered their retreat, and marched back to Bryants, where I collected 470 men, and the 24th went to the battle-ground and buried 43—our loss in this action is 50 missing from Lincoln, and 15 from Fayette, among whom are Colls: Todd and Trigg (Trigg was quartered) Major Harlin, Capts: McBride, Gordon, Kinkaid & Overton, & Lieuts: G-ivings, Kennedy, McMartry, Rogers*& McGuire, and Mr. Joseph Lindsay our Commissary. From the situation of the ground, on which our men were drawn upon (the plan whereof I have taken the liberty to enclose) I hardly know how it was possible for any to escape—I am inclined to believe that when your Excellency & Council become acquainted with the mili- tary operations in this country, that you will not think them so prop- erly conducted, as to answer the general interest of Kentucky—From the accounts we had received by prisoners who had escaped this spring, we were confident of an invasion from the Detroit Indians. Common safety, then made some scheme of defence necessary; for which pur- pose, I was called upon by Genl: Clarke to attend a council and after consulting matters, it was determined to build a Fort at the mouth of Licking—& shortly I received his orders for 100 men to attend this busi- ness, with a certain number from Fayette. Before the day of rendez- vous, I was instructed to send the men to the Falls of Ohio, in order to build a strong Garrison, and a row Galley, thus by weakening one end to strengthen another, the upper part of the country was left exposed, & the enemy intercepting our designs brought their intended expedition against the Frontiers of Fayette—The immense expenses incurred by the state in this western Country, we know is enough to prevent the Government from giving us any further aid; but,when your Excellency and Council are informed that the people have never been benefitted by those expenditures, we still hope your compassion will be extended to a detached, distressed part of your country, as it is not in the power of the People to answer the misapplication of any thing by a proper officer. Genl: Irwin, commanding at Fort Pitt, as a continental officer might probably be more assistance to this country could he receive proper sup- plies from the state of Virginia, than any other measure that could be adopted—As he has the same enemies to encounter that trouble us, and stores of every kind seem to be of little account to us (ammunition excepted)—Col: Trigg being killed there is a Field officer wanting in this county: however I am at a loss how to proceed on the occasion, for all our magistrates have been killed except three; and there can be no 36

Court to send a recommendation—Col: Hanod, who formerly acted as a August, 31st Colonel, and who agrcable to seniority ought to have received a commis- sion, is now in being & I think a very proper person for that purpose— Before I conclude I must beg leave to suggest to your Excellency & Council, that a defensive war cannot be carried on with Indians, and the Inhabitants remain in any kind of safety. For unless you can go to their Towns and scourge them, they will never make a peace; but on the contrary keep parties constantly in your country to kill; and the plunder they get, answers them instead of Trade. Some days past, a white man, one Mr. Simon Burney, with his Indians, arrived at this place, in company with two warriors, with talks from the Chickasaws nation—wherein they inform us of their desire to conclude a peace, and the reasons that urged them to war; which was Genl: Clarke's settling Fort Jefferson on their Hunting Grounds, without consulting them first, and are now enquiring for him. They own they have done mischief in this, as well as the infant settlement on Cumberland—Should your Excellency & Council think proper to hold a treaty with these People, Col: John Donelson, who has before served as an Agent for the state, is willing to transact any business of that kind— Since writing the foregoing lines, I have received certain information that Hinchelow's Fort in Jefferson was burned, and 37 souls, made pris- oners—Your Excellency & Council will please to indulge me a few moments longer, when I take the liberty to add the situation of 470 per- sons who surrendered themselves j^risoners of war to a British Officer, then in command from Detroit, with a great number of Indians—As well as I recollect these unhappy people were captured in June 1780— And from authentick intelligence that we have received, they were actually divided in the most distressing manner that could be invented. Many of the men were taken to Detroit & their wives retained among the Indians as slaves. Some of the men are now at Montreal & others in different parts towards the Lakes—As the British were the perpetrators of this cruel piece of mischief, I think by the articles of the Cartel, for the exchange and relief of Prisoners taken in the Go: Department, and subsequent measures taken by the different commissioners for that pur- pose, it is their business, immediately to deliver up in this country, at some American Post, all the prisoners then taken—or retaliation he had on our part—Unless they are guarded back, they will never get through the Indian country. I have the honor to be &c. &c. &c— The Diagram of the Battle-ground contains the following note. "The indians kept the path from Bryants to the licks, and when Colo. Todd arrived at the Top of the hill on this side of the river, the enemy made a shew of ab't 30 in the bend. Our men marched over upon the Hill. The indians had a very strong line in front which extended from one point of the river to the other. They had flankers and also a party in

As the river was very deep only 1782. at the licks and the clifts so steep that a passage was impracticable only August 31st where they first marched in—thus circumstanced the Savages, sure of victory rushed immediately up and threw our men into confusion. What escaped returned mostly by way of the Lick—many were killed after they were made prisoners, as they were seen tied. From Bryant's Station to the Blue licks ab't 40 miles & from thence to the Ohia ab't 20 or 25. The Bent of the river was generally ab't J mile over & from the top of the ridge each way made down small dreans— in these places lay many indians undiscovered untill the attack begun. It appears near all the warriors' on this side of De Troit were on this expedition; some allow 600 or more." Major Bulgar was mortally wounded, and is since dead." Col: Joseph Nevill to G-ovr.

Those people urges for their justification that Col: Clark's building a Fort and Garrison and settling a number of families in their country without their privity or consent made it necessary to take up arms, "to defend what they deemed their native right, that the cause being in some measure removed, they Declare this desire to be at peace with those states again"— In view of the terrible losses in the battle with the Shawnees on the 19th of August, and the unprotected situation of the frontiers and inhabi- tants, Col: Donelson urges the appointment of Commissioners to nego- ciate a peace, and suggests the French Lick on Cumberland River, as the place most agreable to the Chicasaws, for a meeting. The writing, or Talk, brought by the Chicasaw warrior and Simon Burney is signed by Poymace Tankaw, Mingo Homaw Tuskon Patapo and Paymingo, with their several "marks," and is a copy of the original, enclosed in Col: Logan's Letter of Aug. 30th, 1782. 1st John Tebbs writes to Col: Davies desiring to know whether the Coun- i cil have decided upon his application to be allowed to draw goods from Fork the store not fit for soldiers' clothes.

Many of these were waggoners and canoe-men, negro slaves who could not write and of course could not sign receips—Had he failed to deliver the flour when so needed, serious results might have followed—He is now pressed for a settlement of his accounts by the District Commissioner, and he is called upon for his receipt—For the reasons above given he cannot produce them, but can produce evidence of the delivery of the flour, provided his Excellency will appoint some "gentleman of experience and good reputation" in the neighborhood, with power to look into the transac- tion &c.

I Scptem. 4th have always carefully avoided entering into disputes with the inhab- itants, and can assure your Excellency this is the first I have ever had during a service of near seven years. The inclos'd paper contains answers to the complaints set forth in Mr. Lowry's memorial, they are sign'd by the officers who were quarter'd on him, and I believe them to be facts. On receiving your Excellency's orders to Station the Cavalry on back River, I order'd Capt. Armstead's Troop to Lowry's, not from a (pique) as he supposes, but on account of the pasturage, and thinking it a proper post to defend that part of the Country from the Enemies Barges. Soon after the Troop was quarter'd on him, he wrote to Col: Lavalette, who commanded at that time at this place, requesting him to come down and send them to the Bay. After finding the Col: wou'd not comply with his request, he moved great part of his pasture fence, for no other purpose, I am very certain, but to compel me to move the Troop. Had Mr. Lowry's complaints been just, I shou'cl think the most speedy way of his getting redress wou'd have been to apply to me as Commanding Officer, which he has not done in a single instance, altho' I have been several times at his House. The charge of my taking four beeves from him is true. After being four days in Hampton without a single ration of meat to Issue to the Troops, and no prospect of an immediate supply, I was drove to the disagreeable necesity of seizing a few heaves, and being inform'd by several of the gentlemen of that place, that Mr. Lowiy was no loser by the enemy, and had a large number of cattle, I sent my Quarter Master to him, with written instructions, to show him the necessity of taking this disagreable step. I beg leave to observe to your Excellency that part of those men who have signed their names as witness to the truth of Lowry's complaints, from their fondness for British protections, and wishing to see a dispute between the Civil and Military, has taken uncommon pains to promote this diffrence between Lowry and myself.

Cth "Sir "I have now the honor to transmit to your Excellency an account Chantelly of the manner in which the act of last session for recruiting the Army has been executed in this county. The militia having been laid off into classes according to Law, our number amounted to 38 and you will see by the list inclosed how each class hath as yet acquitted itself. Not a man has been found, but £259.5.35- specie has been paid to me, and I have reason to expect the ballance daily. When the collectors have made returns of defaultees, warrants have issued in the nature of exe- cutions against such defaultees. Nothing as yet can be done with the collectors failing to make return, until a meeting of the Court shall present an opportunity of making motions against them. I am now to request that your Excellency will direct an officer to come and receive this money, for it remains here at very great risk from the pirates that infest this river and the bay. A stout Barge of the enemy was off the mouth of Coan (about 15 miles below this) a few days ago; and they contrive to get such accurate information of the State of things on land, that I have not the least doubt but that they know long ere now, that the houses of the County Lieutenants are the depositories of the Sol- diers Tax and will consequently exert themselves to get possession of the money. This indeed suggests the propriety of quickly removing this collection from all the counties contiguous to the Water, for tho' there is no danger from attempts in the open day, where pains have been taken to arm & Encourage the militia, yet nothing is easier to these pirates, as every days experience proves, than to land in the night and to plunder—houses two or three miles from the Shore and return with Safety to their vessels before day, or any force can be collected to punish them. It is greatly unfortunate for this country that no exertions are made to defend its honor and interest upon the water within the very bowels of the State. It is not only the more general and open com- merce that is destined, but even the small interior trade is ruined, so that no possible channel is left open for the industry of the people to collect money for their produce, and therefore no possible means left for the future payment of taxes. The soldiers tax with the land tax, will glean up the Specie so effectually from this county, that I verily— believe not five pounds will remain within it, nor any method of getting more that now presents.

The ovcr- tures for peace from the Cherokee Chocomogga Towns, and only one feeble attack made this Summer by the Northward Indians, together with the difficulty of procuring provisions, induced me to order out only one half the number of men agreed on at the Council of Officers. Your Excellency might have spared the reflection, had you been informed by whom the objection was made, and insisted on, for one officer to take charge of the Militia of both Counties to be ordered on duty. Frugality in expenditures have always been a very serious considera- tion with me in my public transactions during the war, in proof which I could mention more than one well known instance, which if others in more important stations had as scrupulously observed, our public credit- might not have been brought so deplorably low; and our finances so exceedingly deranged— I am, Sir, veiy Respectfully 3Tour most obedient & very Humble Servant— P.

I had orders to take avery one of the horses taken at the seige of York. I had orders to retake eveiy horse taken since the 27th July 1781 until! the seige of York, those orders were extensive. I could have recovered more than one hundred horses in six countys of this state, but I answer so far your wishes that I have not pursued any method for recovering those which had been retaken by their true & first owners, & that I have only retaken some of those which were in the hands of peoj)le who had no right at all to them, and not the least violence has been made use of— There is a man in this neighbourhood who has in his possession one of my own legion horses who was taken by the enemy while that corps was employed in the defence of this state, has been retaken & brought from our Army by a man then in the militia & now inlisted in my legion, who confess he took it from the publick—I have made application: the man will not give it' up. he has it yet & I know no means of getting him back—this fact must be an undoubted proof of my not acting against the rights of the people—if upon application they deliver their horses freely, then in taking them I answer my orders & certainly in that case can not be accused of acting against the rights of the people. I am sorry that the believe you give to accounts of men who have nothing more to do in this contest, but to be a burden to both the civil & military, because they are of no advantage in either of those lines, has engaged your Excellency to mention at the final of your letter, that you are far from putting the power of determining the property of the people over whom you preside, into the hands of those with whom you can not by any means trust it—this can not concern his excellency the Commander in chief, Since not only the Virginians but all americans enjo}' the fruits of the extensive powers they put into the hands of that great man—this must then concern me—but Sir, permit me to ask how I have shown my mind of determining on the rights of the people &

I do bound my wishes in America—in addition to it, friend- ships for this country, policy for own quietude & m}^ natural inclinations in gage to follow with care such laws & privileges of the people as are established from time to time by their representatives & which may come to my knowledge—the perpetual hindrance which the military * encounter with, from the civil othority in the times of rest has not dis- couraged me. I know what are republican states in their raising to their freedom, my veneration for a virtuous & free constitution is high & not to be equaled but by my perpetual wishes & endeavour to con- tribute of my person & fortune to the establishment of it. I have the honour to be Sir, your most obt. Servt— I have received a letter from the minister at war, who says that he expects the enemy will move soon from Charleston." Col: Chas: Cameron to Col: Wm. Davies. Septem. 9th He is grieved to hear of the distressed situation of Col: Willson and Staunton the people in that quarter—he has given them every assistance in his power, and had instructed the Commissioners of .Rockingham Co. to reserve the "specifics raised in that Count}r" for the troops on the frontier, under Col: Evans or Col: Wilson. And altho' he had notified Col: Armancl of this, his waggons had several times been supplied upon their applying to Col: Harrison for those very articles. For this reason Col: Wilson's command is now suffering, and he has not the means of affording him any relief. He has no money with which to purchase the Salt ordered for him, and if he had it, could not afford transportation "as there is no such thing here as public credit." He can find no one willing to undertake the repairing the Public arms, and cannot well estimate the cost, but thinks it cannot be done for less *than "Ten or fifteen shillings Each." The locks are out of order, ram- rods, and new stocks to be made, and very few have bayonets. He has in vain made efforts to bring the Co. Commissioners to a settlement, and desires instructions as to what he shall do, in these cases, as well as in those, when they have acted as Commissaries and Q. Masters to the militia, and have accounts to settle accordingly.

"Sir Philadelphia Your Excellency's favor of the 23 and 30 ulto. were ree'd yesterday. Not recollecting that any resolution of Congress declaratory of their ultimate sence with regard to confiscations have been published, we apprehend that some mistake must have led to your remarks on that subject. The Journals of Congress for 1779 are not yet Compleated. As soon as they are you shall be furnished with a copy. The propriety of applications to the British Commander for restriction of slaves having never been agitated in Congress, it is impossible for us to inform you with certainty, in what light such a step would be view by them. We can only say that in general all separate & partial transactions between individual States and the Enemy are considered as disaccording with the Spirit of the Confederacy, that a solicitation of favors from the Enemy at this juncture may not be very politic: and that there does not appear to us any sufficient evidence that the application in question if made would be attended with success. The loss of the "Magnifique" a French ship of 74 guns in the Har- bour of Boston, was thought by Congress,'a fit occasion for testifying their sense of the exertion of our Ally in favor of the U. States, and they have accordingly directed the ship America to be presented to the Chevr. de la Luzerne for the service of his most Christian Majesty. General Washington has moved with the Chief part of his Army down to Yerplanks point. Seven ships of the line, part of a fleet from the West Indies, commanded by Admiral Hood are arrived at New York: and 15,000 foreign troops have embarked at that place for Halifax. The Gazette herewith enclosed contains all the intelligence which has yet transpired from the Packet lately arrived at N. York from England. Congress are still destitute of intelligence from their ministers in Europe. The Minister of France is in the same predicament with respect to his Court. It may not perhaps be amiss to suggest to your Excell'y that advan- tage Avill probably be taken of this seeming reverse in the prospect of peace, to speculate on the Staple of Virginia. We hope our Country men will be on their guard against such artifices. We have the honor to be with sentiments of the highest regard. yr: Excell'y's obt. Servts."

CALENDAE OF STATE PAPEES. 297 "To the Chicasaw Chiefs, &c. 1782. "Brothers, SePtem- 10fch This Letter is on a subject that concerns the Chicasaws and Falls of Ohio americans much. I mean the Establishment of a town for the conve- nience of trade at the mouth of Ohio, where the old Fort stood, you know that the great Eivers center there, so that the traders can send their goods from that place to Every Quarter of this great country, and very convenient for your nation in particular, as it lies near to your hunting grounds. The merchants can convey their goods to the mus- chel shoals by water or by Land, as Either way is convenient; and such trade between us would more finally fix that good understanding that each party seem to wish for. And now we have become brothers again, we would not wish to do any thing towards fixing a post without con- sulting you & geting your consent, which we hope to do, and are willing to pay you for any little tract of land you will let us have, we dont want much, but you know a place so well situated for trade as that is, must soon become a great town, and that it will take a good many 'peo- ple to Eaise provisions to supply it. Suppose you was to let us have , that little tract of country between the Mississippi, Tenesee & Ohio Eivers. That a line should be mark't, beginning on the Mississippi, twenty two miles south of where the fort stood and Eunning an East Course to the Tenesee Eiver. This Includes but a small tract of land; about enough to maintain the Inhabitants of the town that may be built, which is all we want, at the same time the Eoads thro' this land may be open for the Chicasaw warriors, and no Yirginian shall presume Even to hunt or cut a stick of wood over that boundary line without your consent. That the line shall be marked plain, so that no person may be deceived in it, and that it shall forever be a boundary between you and the Virginians. 1 make no doubt but you will agree to this reasonable proposal, as it must be so much to your advantage in having a good and convenient trade in a very short time after the settlement shall be made, and goods will be much cheaper every year, as the tra- ders will be able to buy their provisions cheap from the farmers that will settle round the town. I am in hopes you will think as I do Eespect- ing this affair. Capt: George who treats with you on the subject of peace is also Impowered to lay this matter before you, and to do all things therein, that may seem good to both parties. And as I Expect our friendship is fixt forever I hope he will meet with no Difficulty in getting you to agree to what is proposed, as it will further convince your brothers the Americans, of your attachment to them— I am &c. &c." 38

"To THE GREAT CHIEFS AND WARRIORS OF THE CHICASAW NATION, Septem. 10th &c-' &c-" Fort Nelson "I Eeceiv'd your speech that you sent by Mr. Burney and the young warriors which you sent with him. I am glad to find that you are inclined to piece. The Americans are always ready to take those by the hand that wish to be in friendship with them, and as ready to sharpen the tomahawk against those that wish to darken the sky. You know you struck the Americans first in favor of the English. It was after that the fort was built at the mouth of the Ohio to watch your motions, as well as the Cherokees and Waponockys, to Encourage trade &c— But the Soldiers were withdrawn from that place for a short time, with our Intention to prepare and send a greater body of men and pro- visions. But now we are like to be friends and brothers no such thing is necessary. Except such Settlem'ts as shall be agreed on hereafter between us for the mutual advantage of both nations. You mention in your talk that you would not fall out with your fathers the English that always supply'd (you) with necessaries &c. It gives me a good oppinion of you to find you are greatfull, but you have a wrong Idea. The People that formerly furnished you were the Americans that live on the same land that you do, and not the English that live beyond the great water, that are flattering you, with an intention to make Slaves of the whole of us. I dont think you know the cause of the War between the Americans & the English, as you have only had bad words among you, sent by the English to delude you. I here explain to you. The Americans not many years ago, was as one people with the English and took part in all their wars &c. until lately the English got proud and wanted to make Slaves of the Americans, saying that all the lands was theirs from the Eising to the Seting Sun. They brought great Armies among us to Oblige us to do what they pleas'd, and made the Americans pay double price for all the goods they bought and would not let us trade with any nation but themselves. And obliged the Americans to pay dear for all the land they raised corn on, and if a Hunter kil'd a deer they took the skin and only let him have the meat for his wife and children, saying they would soon oblige all the Eed people to do so too. They even went so far as to offer to stop the American women from making any blankets to cover their children, and oblig'd us to pay no Eegard to the good Eules laid down by the Councels of our old men, but made laws for us as they pleas'd, Kiling some of our people that would not obey them, nor would they listen to any thing we had to say for our- selves. Such Cruelty occasional us to be poor and naked. We knew how to make Every thing if the English would let us, but we were oblig'd to buy from them for what price they pleas'd—Not being able to bear it any longer, all our wise men assembled at a great Council-fire,

Many battles was fought in which the English was beat—They caJ'd all the people to their assistance deluding them with presents, as you are witness, saying to themselves they would hire the Red people to scalp the Americans and at las make slaves of the whole, but all hath been in vain. Two of their great armies was Kil'd and made prisoners. The French and Spaniards Join'd the Americans, and in a short time after the Dutch, another great nation Join'd us and said the English had no right, nor should not make slaves of the Americans, so that the English are oblig'd now to keep close in their Forts. And I expect in a short time the name of an Englishman wont be heard in the land. And all the Red people that continues to fight for them will be put from under the sun, while those that are in friendship with the Americans, French and Spaniards, will flourish as the green trees. I am a man and a warrior & dont dissemble. Believe what I tell you to be true. The Red people have as great a right to strike the English as the Americans have. But we only want them to sett still and look on, we are able to fight them ourselves. I have fully explain'd the nature of the war to you. Do you be carefull and have it well interpreted to you, and dont be Imposed on. You see what great Right we had to make war on the English, and how wrong the Red people was in fighting against us. And the Ruler of all things has continued to clear our eyes and cast a mist on our Enemies, so that there is shortly like to be a piece thro the land. I Receiv'd Copies of the talks you got from the Illinois and was glad to find you Receiv'd them. I send you a few strings of wampum to Represent the sincerity of my heart, and to bury the bones of the slain. And now call you my brothers, taking you by the hand, confirming the piece between you and the Americans, hoping that Each party will con- duct themselves so as that it may last as long as the waters flow. And that whenever we meet, we may smoke together as brothers ought to do, not Even Remember the days of darkness, and that our blood for the future may be dear to Each other, now brothers as him that liveth above the clouds hath thought fit to Join our hearts and hands together as true friends and allies, would it not be well for you to consider the neighboring nations that live near you, the creeks and others that are at war against us, and let them know of the cloud that hovers over their land, if they do not lay down the tomahawk—The americans are free and generous, they hold piece in one hand & war in the other. It would be well in you to Recommend to those people to make choice in time otherways their children may cry, when they might laugh, as the Eng- lish will be no more. The great men of the Americans will be very glad to hear of this piece we have made, and I shall send letters thro' the land Every where proclaiming the piece that is now confirm'd

But in order Brothers, to make this piece more solemn, I have sent Capt: George, one of my Officers, to Represent me at the great Council of your nation, and confirm what I have wrote to you. he is a warrier. believe what he says to you, as tho' I spoke it to you myself. When he gives you his hand, you Receive the hands of all the Americans and I hope when you are in Counsel together that the sky may be clear, that all your talks may be for the good of both nations, and all people that will hear them. Now Brothers Paymantahow, Mingahamaw, Tuskapa- tapo and Pymingo, I sign my name and fix my seal to this good talk that it may Remain as witness among you, hopeing that I receive another from you more agreeable than the first— I am your loving brother &c. &c."

An Express was sent here, my Brother being absent, I went with about 30 men Discovery and force my way into the Fort, near Bryants I was joined with about 10 more, finding the enemy lay round, we attempted forcing our way. 17 men on Horseback rushed in, the greater part of rest being on Foot were prevented & overpowered, obliged to seek safety by flight with the Loss of one killed & 3 wounded, one of which died the Cols: Trigg next morning—I immediately despatched an Express to Col: Trigg the and Todd &c higjieS£ officer in Lincoln, demanding assistance, & also Notice to Colo.

The Enemy must have suffered con- siderably, a great part of our men fought with much Resolution & Activity. The Conduct of the Officers is by some censured & charged Conduct of with want of prudence in attacking at any Bate, but as we had no the ^cers chance to know their number, we thought ours was not much Inferior & supposed we should by a fierce attack throw them in confusion & break their Lines. We are much alarmed in this County & fear the Consequence will be very detrimental if government cannot give assistance, tho' our great dependence is that if the Count}?- surveyor would attend, we should be strengthened with additional settlers not a few— I am Sir, Your Excellency's most obedient & very Humble Servnt &c. &c.

We can scarcely behold a spot of Earth, but what reminds us of the fall of some fellow adventurer massacred by Savage hands. Our number of militia decreases. Our widows & orphans are numerous, our officers and worthiest men fall a sacrifice. In short sir, our settlement, hitherto formed at the Expence of Treasure & much Blood seems to decline, & if something is not speedily done, we doubt will wholly be depopulated, the Executive we believe think often of us & wish to protect us, but Sir, we believe any military operations that for 18 months have been carried on in Consequence of Orders from the Executive, have rather been detrimental than Beneficial. Our Militia are called on to do duty in a manner that has a tendancy to protect Jefferson County, or rather Louisville, a Town without Inhabitants, a Fort situated in such a manner, that the Enemy coming with a design to Lay waste our Country, would scarcely come within one Hundred miles of it, & our own Frontiers open & unguarded.

If it is thought impracticable to carry the war into the Ene- my's Country, he beg the plan of building a Garrison at the mouth of Lime-stone & another at the mouth of Licking, formerly prescribed by your Excellency, might be again adopted & performed. A Garrison at the mouth of Limestone, would be a Landing place for adventurers from the Back parts of Pensylv'a & Yirg'a, adjacent to a large Body of good Land which would be speedily settled—would be in the Eneaij^'s prin- cipal crossing place, not more than fifty miles from Lexington our Largest settlement, & might readily be furnished with provition from above, till they would be supplied from our Settlements here. Major Netherland, we expect will deliver this, he will attend to give any particular information that may be deemed necessary— Humanity towards Inhabitants destitute of Hopes of any other aid, will surely induce your Excellency to spare from the interior parts of the State 200 men, and a few pieces of Artillery for those purposes above mentioned.

Lexin£ton The frequent Incursions & Hostile Depredations of a Savage Enemy upon our Exterior Posts, our Despersed Legions, our veteran army defeated, our Widows Tears & orphans cries grate strongly on the Ear, nay Thunder at the Door of your Council, not only for acts of considera- tion, but Protection & redress. To express the feelings of the Inhabitants at the Euefull scenes of Barbarities daily perpetrated amongst us, barrs all words & cut Descrip- tion short. So fatal is the stroke that a'second similar to that we have already Eec'd will close the Catastrophy & Terminate the Intire Devas- tation of our County. I would beg leave to inform you that annually since the seventeen Hund'd & seventy eight, an army of not less than three Hund'd Saveges Infested our Territories & since seventy six, Eight Hundred & sixty Effective men fell, the matchless massacread victims of their unprecedented Cruelty. A few of the primitive adventurers yet survive, who supplicate your Excellencies Immediate Interposition in their behalf, in granting them such strength, as may enable them to carry on an offensive war, or at least Act in the Defensive with safety, for if some mode of preservation is not speedity adopted the wealthy will forthwith Emigrate to the Interior parts of the Settlement & the Poor to the Spaniards. Dreadfull alternative!! Nature recoils at the thought!—further, from the Jealous apprehension of the Inhabitants I am under the Disagreeable necessity of Informing your Excellency that from the Detainour of our Countj- Surveyor (from whom their greatest Expectations of strength was derived) they are Induced to believe 3-011 have either withdrawn that Paternal care which they have long Eely'd on or rather the Executive Body are Dubious of the authenticity of their Claim to those Western Territories—I would also observe that the many Military Operations hitherto Effected, or rather Intended for our safety (the Seventeen Hundred & Eighty Indian Expedition excluded, the Honour whereof is Justly due to the militia) have centred at Louis- ville, a Town distant one Hund'd miles from the Center of our County, to which together with Fort Jefferson, Elinois & St. Yincennes, may the Innormous Expence of the Western Ironteers be Attributed & not to the Counties of Kanetucky, which in competition would be less than a Mathematical Point. To Conclude, Permit us, once more the Indigent Offspring of an oppulent father, if not Equally to share, yet to partake of your Kind patronage & Protection & beg you would adopt such meas- ures as your Superior Wisdom may suggest to Promote the Peace, well- fare & Tranquility of your Suppliants in particular & the Interest of the Commonwealth in Genl.

Kirkpatrick Bohannan & Lieut: Smith the Counties of Cumberland, Septem. 1 Powhatan & the Eendezvous. It will only be necessary that the Co. Lieutenants of Cumberland and Powhatan receive instructions accord- ingly from the Executive, should this plan be approved. Capt. Ambrose Bohannan's & Capt. Abraham Kirkpatrick's appointment was approved by the Gov'r. Chas: Dick to Col: Davies. Septem. 12th He has issued no arms since the last returns made. Col: Peachy Fredericks- whose letter is enclosed of Eichmond Co. wanted some. In July last he burg had nineteen workmen employed and five apprentices; by promises and assurances of getting their })ay he had kept them at work for some time, but their patience was exhausted, and the sufferings of their families had caused them to drop off, until now he has only four, with two apprentices whose time of service are almost expired. Continues "There is a com- pleate master workman whose business it is to examine the work, and if properly finished to receive it, direct them where in fault, and instruct them when ignorant, issues out the proper Tools and materials for work, Provisions to be cook'd, in short every thing for the proper manage- ment of such a large Family, and when at leisure, works. "When Break- fast & Dinner are ready the Bell rings and all regularly sit down at table to eat, when done, to work again, so that no time is lost. When absent they are duly charged with the lost time. There is a spacious garden which supplies the necessary Greens and roots, & a noble spring of water. By the above method, order & Gov- ernment, with sundry rules too tedious to mention, and the greatest Economy, the Factory has been carried on to this day, to the great advantage of the State. The above manager is at £125 pr: arm: the workmen as in merit from £3. 5s. to £5. 10s. pr: month. Each is necessary in his way, as the scourer of a Gun bar'l cannot do the work of a compleat finisher of musket, or repair Arms. Where work can be done by the piece, I have it done, being better for the country and gives encouragement to the industrious—for stocking a musket 6 shills: fileing a Gun Lock 6 shill— mounting pr: sett 3 shill &c. &c. Thus I have endeavour'd to give you a very short but true sketch of the business of this Factory, which can produce compleat muskets & Bayonets superior to most imported, from the Buff materials of wood, Iron & Steel, and make their own Tools & variety of machinery for the greater Dispatch. It may be carried on to any Extent, provided to do this, a necessary stock of the most necessary articles are laid in, and the Workmen duly and faithfully paid, at a cheaper rate and much greater dispatch than private Shops, when they hardly know what it is to do a Day's Work." 39

306 CALEKDAB OF STATE PAPEES. 1782. John Coleman Co. Lieut., informs the Governor, that in accordance Septem. 13th with the Act of the last G-enl: Assembly, for recruiting the states quota Halifax Co. of troops to serve in the Army of the U. States, he had summoned the Field Officers, Capts: & Clerks together to arrange the "Divisions" in the County, of which there were "56," and proceeded according to law. The returns have come in, "but produced no Soldier, every militia man had paid their propotion." The Exempts however had not paid, and steps were taken accordingly. The amount of Tax collected is "four Hundred & seventy pounds," of which he has in hand "three hundred & sixty" and "shall be glad to know by the Bearer" what he is to do with it. Septem. 13th Henry Bell to Brig: Genl: Muhlenberg "at the Bendezvous." "Sir Buckingham I received your favour by your messenger (James White) this County moment: in which you request me to send you the circumstances and reasons which induced me to AjDprehend and Confine a party sent from your Post to apprehend a Certain John Childres of this county as a Deserter. They are as follows. The said John Childres had been a Deserter I will admitt: but was not so at that time, neither is he so now, or a discharge will avail any man nothing: for I had before me Col: Febiger's (letter) elated the sixth day of August last. Part of what the Sergeant reported was true, and if you had seen the Letter which I wrote to Genl: Scott, by the Sergeant, you would then have seen that I neither headed the Party myself, nor treated the Sol- diers ill. I did not (tho' a militia officer) act in this matter as an officer: Upon Childriss being apprehended, he dispatched a messenger to me and claimed the protection of the Civil Power: In consequence I as a Justice of the Peace for this County had a right, and did Issue my War- rant, and ordered the Officer to take as much assistance as he should think necessary and take the Party together with Childres and bring them before me, to be examined by what authority they had taken the said Childres. accordingly they were taken and brought before me and upon Examination I found they had no orders for doing what they had done, except in their own Justification, said they were ordered by a Sergeant Stephens (who was then out on Command) to go to Childres' and take him and carry him to one of the neighbours and then to wait until he should come up. In order to be fully satisfied in the matter, I Issued another Warrant and Ordered a party to go to the House where the Soldiers said their Sergeant was, to meet them and bring him to me to be examined whether the others had taken Childres of their own accord or not: Upon the Sergeants being brought, I examined him by what authority he had sent them four Soldiers (pointing to them, for I
Page 307
CALENDAE OF STATE PAPEES. 307 knew not their names) to take Childres. he readily answered me he 1782. had: I then asked him for his Orders, which he produced. I then Sep tern. 13 th referred to Colo. Febiger's discharge and Compared it with the date of the orders and found that the Discharge was prior to the Orders, and consequently no military Officer upon Earth had a right to take Chil- dres, and thereupon discharged Childres, and told the Sergeant he might repair to his Post as soon as he pleased, for that the officer who sent him had no right to do so, but that he himself was not to blame, neither were the men under his command: and treated them with as much civility as I was master of. You are Grievously misinformed if you think Childres obtained his Discharge fraudulently: for admitting him to have been a Soldier for the war (tho' this by the by, was never before charged against him) no man ever gained a Discharge by a Substitute with less deception: for it is well known that Childres never saw the Substitute from the day he was hired (& that was done without his knowledge) 'till after he had Deserted. As to my opinion of Childres, it is a matter of no consequence in the Present dispute: for the dispute now is whether the civil or military Power is to govern. If you will examine the Bill of Eights for this State, you will there find who are to be subservient. And as to what Childres might apprehend by being carried and tried by a court mar- tial, I know not: but this much I know, you nor no officer In the Army have any right to apprehend a civil citizen of this State and drag him before a court martial to be tried for crimes he knows not of. As to my treatment of the Soldiers, Disarming and Confining them merely for doing their Duty, I hope I have fully satisfied you on this head: If not, I will Justify it forever. I do know that they were amenable to the officer from whom they received their orders, for their Conduct: and I at the same time know that officers sometimes Issue orders, that were they to be tried by the Laws of this State they could not Justify them- selves. It is true you ought to be as much bound by the Laws of this State, as any citizen in it, and consequently ought to take care how you violate them. I am sorry to find a Gentleman of your Eank and Character get so warm on a Subject, in my opinion not worth it, for it is very true neither you nor I have Authority to do what we think Justice to ourselves; and am sure Genl: Muhlenberg must have forgot himself when he mentions trying the Mettle of the high spirited militia of this County, with the poor remains of the Yirg'a Line; for had he not, he would have trembled at the thought of being the first mover of one Brothers cutting the Throat of another. But this much Genl: Muhlenberg may rely on, notwithstanding what he writes, that I will to the utmost of my Power Defend the Civil Eites of every Free Citizen, not only within this County, but throughout the Whole State. The Officer which I sent and apprehended your soldiers,
Page 308
308 CALENDAE OF STATE PAPEES. 1782. informed me he had about sixteen or eighteen men with him: I will Septem. 13th leave you to Judge whether you were rightly informed as to their num- ber or not— You entertain a very unjust Opinion of me, if you think that I detain Childress for any advantage that he would be to me in any Case what- soever: and as to your looking to me for him: from me you shall never get him, unless he Commits a Crime for which the Civil Power of this State condemns him to be a Soldier, in which case I would as chearfully deliver him to you, as any other Officer belonging to the Army. If I have been so unfortunate, from all that I have said, not to be able to convince }^ou that I have acted a Just Part, and one Justifiable by the Laws of this State,- you may represent the matter to His Excellency the Governor as soon as you please, when I have no doubt ample Justice will be done: without the evidence of John Childress— I am Sir, Your most obed't Serv't." Septem. 14th Jno: Scott to Col: Da vies, in regard to the settlement of the Com- missioners' accounts in his District. Albemarle The Com'rs of Fluvanna, Messrs. Haden, Williamson and Quarles Co- wanted a quantity of Hemp, with which to purchase Sugar of Mr. Peter Perkins' wagons "traveling from JSTorth to South" to do which they sold the "public hemp" and have never settled for it. He hears they are about to Settle with the Auditors at Eichmond and pay in paper money what it " Sold for near two years ago." They desire to settle "below" in order to avoid doing so with him, and so get "clear without being detected"—He hopes no Settlement will ever be allowed at the Auditors from his District, except through his hands, as he is deter- mined to "sift every matter to the bottom." He is about to "fall on a new method" of bringing the Comm'rs to a settlement, that is "to go to those Gents' houses & live on them till they will settle with me." He fears a bad account will be given from Albemarle Co. Mr. Key cannot be brought to a settlement but he shall go to his house and require it— indeed he would be glad to arrange his accounts with "any body below" rather than with himself "for reasons best known to himself." If Mr. Eobertson still wants the corn he wrote for, near the county line of Albemarle & Louisa, it will be impossible to get it, as the County "owes Dr. Walker & Son a large quantity borrowed by the Marquiss' Order, and drawn on the Com'rs to pay it."

CALENDAR OF STATE PAPERS. 309 Arthur Lind to Col: Davies. 17822. Septem. 14th Respecting his rank as Surgeon in the Army. His appointment Richmond "runs thus." "Chesterfield, April 17th, 1781. Capt: Lt: Arthur Lind is appointed to do the duties of Regimental Surgeon at this place STEUBEN, Maj: Genl:" From this date he has been with the Genl: Rendezvous, has attended and innoculated the Troops and has never been absent from duty. Has never had any assistance, except when Dr. Yates remained one month at the Rendezvous, where he has always had forty to fifty sick men, exclusive of two hundred and fifty-four men innoculated. He desires now to know what his position is in the Army. If he is a Regimental Surgeon, he "shall do the duties of that post," if Hospital, he "must be appointed to that station" and if neither, he wishes to be paid and discharged. The consciousness of his having always complied with his engagements as Surgeon, gives him a degree of satisfaction "that mankind cannot take away." Concludes "I took up arms in the defence of American Liberty so early as August 1775. I have served the State from that period to this. I never had a furlough, & have ever had a great share of health, which has enabled me to persevere thro' the difficulties of a Soldier's life, in every station, from the carrying of a musquet, to the weilding of a Clyster pipe." * * * * * * All I wish, all I want is to know whether I am a Surgeon or not." Capt: H. Young informs Col: Davies of the necessity of procuring a Septem. 15th supply of leather to repair a number of saddles in his hands. Mrs. Eichmond Parks has a large supply on hand which should be gotten. Col: Dab- ney informs him "several of his Dragoons are obliged to do duty on horse back without saddles." Robert Beverly to "His Excellency Benj: Harrison, Esq'r, & Septem. 15th THE HONOURABLE, THE GENTLEMEN OF THE COUNCIL." "Amidst the many embarrassments & distresses in which we have been for some years involved, it has been difficult for a subject of this state to know by what line he is to conduct himself.

Septem. 15th It is not my design to say in what a variety of instances, I have expe- rienced a deviation from these principles. The cause of my present address proceeds from a violence which was offer'd to me last year. In the multitude of articles which were unconstitutionally wrested from me, were two of my chariot horses. They were taken with many circum- stances (of) insult by a Mr. John Baylor & his armed party called vol- unteer Dragoons, were made use of by Mr. Baylor, & at length fell into the hands of Col: Temple of moylands, & Capt: Pemberton, of Whites regiments. One of these horses some time ago came to the plantation of a friend of mine in King & Queen, who hire,d one of his neighbors to bring him to me, conscious that I had received no compensation for him & supposing that no power could be authorized to detain the property of another. Solicitous however, to avoid censure, I wrote to Col: Temple & recapitulated the circumstances attending the seizure of the horse & his being sent to me. From this gentleman I received the answer here inclosed, & from whence you will be enabled to judge who has the most equitable title to the horses in question & whether they ought to be returned to me or not. I should be glad to live in a society where the laws are properly promulgated, & where these laws are to be the sole directors of men's conduct. In .such a society, it is an easy matter to acquit ourselves as good citizens & thereby render such a society com- fortable to all its members. Before I conclude, I must beg gentlemen, that you will be pleased, through the hands of Col: Smith, to send me such instructions as you shall think proper upon this occasion, by which you will oblige, gentlemen, yr: most obedt. & most hum. Servt. Septem. 16th Col: Chas: Dabney to Gov: Harrison. "Sir York Town Your Excellency's letter by Majr. Dick, I have received, and shall order a Court Martial for the tryal of Capt: Eoan your Excellency may rest assured that neither Capt: Eoan or any other officer of the Legion shall be protected by the military from the prosecution of the civil law. The warrant against Capt: Eoan was issued at Williamsburg, and no attempt has been made to take him here. Last Wednesday about thirty of the Cavalry on back river refused to do duty, till they were paid, and paraded on Horseback in order to go to Eichmond and apply for money, from the exertions of the officers they were dispersed, and the ring leaders are here in irons. I shall have them tried by a Court Martial. Unless the Troops get money soon, I fear it will be out of my power to keep them in service. We are very sickly at this post. I have done

I have the honor to be Your Excellency's most obedient Serv't." Col: Davies encloses to the Governor a statement from Mr. James Septem. 16th Anderson of the Condition of the Tools, &c, belonging to the State, he War Office having retired from "public business" the previous July. Every article delivered to him had been carefully preserved until Arnold's invasion in January, 1781, when nearly the whole were destroyed including "eight pair of bellows"—A few "anvils and vices" alone were preserved. Wm. Reynolds informs Col: Davies, he has had the "mortar removed Septem. 16th to Westham" unless he can know the location of the cannon "on the Eichmond several creeks of nansemond" he can give no information as to the diffi- culties to be encountered in raising them. A pair of large shears, with some alterations in them are necessary for such work. Col: Joseph Holmes to Col: Davies. Septem.

The people very backward in paying up their grain, but the sherifs will collect it all. Bacon cannot be gotten, but he can procure beef and pork by bartering for them with flour. The Commissioners of Berkeley, Hampshire & Frederick have as yet made no return altho' he has made repeated applications to them, and has consumed at least "two quires of paper" in writing to them: but he finds it would be as much to the purpose, were he "to write to an Indian" on the subject. The militia ordered to the westward he suppose "won't have to march, as "Genl. Irvin writes that there has not been seen any enemy on the frontiers this five weeks." Should they have marched, he orders that they be halted at "Brasons Town on the southwest side of Laurell Hill."

The continued invasion of the country soon afterwards put a stop to all importations for a considerable time & I expected the orders I had given would not have been attended to, unless removed on my part— however it seems soon after the news of the Eeduction of York & Glou- cester, my friends took up the orders & proceeded upon them. By this cutter I have received Cloath'g for a thousand Soldiers including suits for 100 Sergeants. This with another parcel ree'd some time ago, via St Thomas, will be sufficient for 1500 or 2000 Troops. The coats are of blue cloth, lined through with white serge & metal buttons U. S. A.

He submits however cheerfully to their superior judgment. As to the public Arms, they were carried away at the time of the Seige of York, together with all the private ones to be gotten and were never returned.

What I heard was in Mr. Baker's possession, I also Septem. 20th mentioned in my last return; but it might as well been in the moon for any use it has been to this County. An unwillingness has taken place in fact, to undertake the business of Commissioners of Specifics; not I believe from anjr disaffection to the public interest, but from the impracticability of executing the law. Figure to yourself a County one hundred miles long and fifty or upwards, broad, intersected by various ranges of high mountains, and consider how hard it is to men of small fortunes, frequently in immediate danger from the Indians, or harrassed in searching for them to carry grain &c. to a magazine 20 or 30 or some cases 40 miles from them. It is true cash is an alternative; but alas of the shining metals we have almost none. The most of this County men happen to be Whigs. Our confidence in the public faith, our zeal for the promotion of American politics learned us early to despise gold and take paper. A few design- ing pedlars (and perhaps British Agents) with other speculators sweeped the hard money away before the paper was knocked down, and our dis- tance from market and the dullness of Trade, since none of the new circulating Specie are yet brought in, added to this the public are in arrears to us for personal Service, provisions &c. since the year 1779, particularly the Expeditions to King's Mountain, Cherokee Towns and the affair at Guilford, which straitened poor men exceedingly to mount, equip and furnish themselves with provisions so suddenly for such distant and hard times. Col: Christian pass'd the other day on his way to the Long Island. Col: Martin is expected about this time from the Towns, so expect the the negociation with the Cherokees will be brought to a point. I hear Carolinia goes on with their preparations for an Expedition against them. I trusted our Governor or General Greene would have so interfered that no clashing of measures would have happened. On the 11th Inst: a party of northward Indians penetrated as far in this County as the Settlement on the head of Mockison Creek, which is within ten or twelve miles of Abingdon; attacked a family of fourteen in number, of course secured in an interiour part, kill'd the husband on the spot, captivated the wife and six of the children, three of whom after being a short space in the enemies hands, was most inhumanly murdered, one a young woman so long survived the blows as told the tragic tale. Two made their escape the first day and night. The old woman and one child with a considerable booty in horses, household goods &c, was carried foward three days some distance down Sandy Eiver. When part of our militia on duty, with a perseverance in pur- suit thro' a most rugged and difficult way, that does them honor, over- took the Indians and wounded several of them, recovered unhurt the

"We might not be so anxious for peace with the Cherokees, were it not if the war is continued, we will be the greatest sufferers; for proba- bly the Cherokees will be drove from the vally they at present live in, lower down the Cherokee Eiver, or somewhere westward of the Apa- lachain Mountains. The Kentucky path now full of travellers, and that Country attacked by the Southern as well as Northern Tribes, will make it a place of very disagreeable residence."

Mr. Hays thinks an Order from the Executive is necessary before can feel author- ized to proceed in the business. When he first came to Eichmond to engage "in publick business," it was at the particular "instance & desire" of the Council, in considera- tion of the great inconvenience attending his removal without previous provision having been made for a dwelling house, that he had rented one at the public cost. This he had unwillingly done, and at the rate of "sixty pounds pr: annum." As soon as his affairs shall have been arranged, he proposes to leave the City; but the rent of the above men- tioned house is now due, and unless paid, there will be an attachment of his personal property, "a ceremony which he has no reason to expect his Landlord will dispense with." He therefore begs leave to request that so much of his wages may be advanced, as will enable him "to depart in peace from the premises." In view of the great poverty of the State, nothing but absolute necessity & justice to his family compells him to make this demand. Septem. 23d W. ARMISTEAD TO THE GOVERNOR. Richmond Having been required by the Executive to remove to Eichmond in the discharge of his official duties, he was provided with a dwelling house at a rent "of sixty pounds pr: annum." It was not in accordance with his wishes to have been thus furnished at public cost; for now as he is about to leave the city, unless his pay is advanced to him at once, his landlord "will not dispense with the ceremony" of attaching his per- sonal property, if his rent is not paid. Septem. 23d Col: Birkett Davenport informs Col: DavieS) that the whole of the Culpeper Co. "specifics" in his District are disposed of except some wheat, ordered to be made into flour. This can be furnished when wanted. He has a number of blind and poor horses, which he recommends be sold, instead of attempting to drive them to Eichmond. The money received of the former Commissioners, is not worth the expence of hiring a person to carry it to the Treasury. Septem. 23d Jonas Ingham, a merchant taken and paroled at the capitulation of Richmond York, prays the Gov: & Council to be allowed to become a Citizen, or be continued on parole.

Septem. 24th "Sir * * * * * * Philadelphia By the two Frigates mentioned in our last, Congress have received letters from Doct'r Franklin & Mr. Jay, who were at Yersailles, dated the 25th & 29th of June. The sum of the intelligence which they bring concerning negotiations for peace, is that the sincerity manifested at one period by the Court of London in her advances toward a pacification, had been succeeded by an apparent design to draw the negociations into length, with the hope of such further advantages during the campaign as would enable her to rise in her demands. Some communications which have been made to Congress, by the French minister present the same idea. The loss sustained in the French Frigate which had got aground in Delaware Bay proves to be greater than was at first reported. The Enemy have succeeded in their attempts to float ber, and have taken in her, besides a considerable quantity of merchandize, nearly 50,000 Dol- lars. The paper No. 1 herewith enclosed, being an Extract of a letter from Doct'r Franklin to the Superintendant of Finance, will inform your Excellency of some further tokens of friendship, which the United States have received from their Ally." We have the honor to be, with great esteem, your Excelly's obet: & h'ble servants. Extract from Br. Franklin's letter dated Passy Jane 25, 1782. "I am upon the point of liquidating all our accounts with the Gov- ernment here, and giving one general obligation for the whole sum that the King has lent us (exclusive of gifts or subsidies) wh. sum amounts to 18,000,000 livres. By the particular obligations I have from time to time given for separate sums, I had engaged in behalf of the Congress, that they should be paid off, the 1st Jan'y 1788, with the interest at 5 pr: cent. By the terms of this general obligation, which is in form of an agreement or contract between the King & the U. States, his majesty graciously considering that it may incommode the U. States to pay the whole sum at one time, is pleased to agree that it may be paid in 12 dif- ferent yearl}T payments, to commence with the first year after the peace: leaving nevertheless to our choice & liberty the payment of any greater proportion and more early periods as may be convenient to our finan- ces. His majesty also Kindly & generously remits all the interest already accrued on my former obligations, or that would have accrued thereby to the end of the war, which is already a considerable sum. With regard to the 10,000,000 livres borrowed in Holland, we have that

The charges of commission & Banque on this loan have been considerable & paid by the King. These also his majesty is pleased to remit." Septem. 25th CaPT: H. YOUNG TO THE EXECUTIVE. Richmond The shortness of the present crop, has so much increased the demand for grain of all kinds every where within reach of Eichmond, that it cannot now be procured on credit, except at very advanced prices. He has only about "twenty days forage on hand" and is destitute of money. He therefore suggests, that a sufficient quantity of the Public Tobacco be disposed of, so as to obtain a supply of grain. The great scarcity of money will doubtless induce the people to take tobacco for grain, if it be offered them before the next collections. Grain is said to be selling low on the Eastern shore; if so, tobacco might be deposited with the Commissioner there, to pay for grain. The risk and freight from the Eastern Shore to this side, will be amply balanced by the difference in prices here and there. Concludes, "Without considering Colo. Dabney's Corps, we shall consume, at half allowance, at this Post, and at the Point of Fork, eighty thousand weight of long Forage, from the first of October, to the first of May, and five hundred bushels of corn pr: month."

The French sent 50 of the Oport Indians after their horses, retook all their horses, one of our men is missing, we suppose he is killed. What has raised the Jealousy of the French, is that Genl: Clark's Express arrived but a few days before the horses were taken, to Mr. Dalton to contrive the cannon privately from Oport to the falls. The French demanding a sight of the express, it was refused, which has con- firmed their opinion that Genl: Clark is concerned in sending the men there for that purpose, and if this breach is not made up shortly we may expect all the Western Indians on our backs."

He has advanced to the State, "above twelve hundred hhds: Tobo. besides money," and to ask for only "150 or 200 hhds:" to enable him to discharge some debts, he thinks was modest. He trusts however he shall be able to ride in a few days, when he will appear in Richmond to meet these difficulties &c. Septem. 26th Capt: A.

Septem. 26th DAVID Ross TO THE GOVERNOR. 'Arrowfield' He observes that under the present arrangement, the "Financier Genl: is to Cloath the whole army." He, himself, claims no contract, although he imported the goods solely for the purpose of clothing the Troops, and as he was not bound to the State, of course the State is not bound to him. The letter his Excellency- proposes to address to the Financier is all he can expect, and if he wants to purchase clothing, "he may as well lay out a part of the money in Yirginia, as else where."

I hope it will not be thought strange that the door was forced, when I tell you that the magazine was guarded by a Contin'l Soldier, who knew little of his duty, owing to his Just Joining the detachment. Tho' he had repeated orders to suffer no person to come near the place. I wish a guard immediately sent up for the purpose of guarding the magazine, as I cannot suppose it entirely safe without, in the mean time shall use every endeavor in my power to preserve it, as well as every thing else committed to my charge."

Col: Wm. Christian to Gov: Harrison. Septem. 28th "Sir I take the Liberty of addressing a few Lines to your Excellency, Mont- upon the Subject of the Kentucky Country, and flatter myself it requires * Co no apology, as you are acquainted with my being a Representative for that Country. A few days ago, the Eeport of an Expedition made by the Savages into Fayette reached this far, and perhaps may be at Rich- mond before this Letter; but as I have seen a Letter from Colo. Levi Todd, I will enclose an extract from it, for your Satisfaction, as you may not yet have had any well authenticated account from thence. The number of men killed is a lamentable thing for that Country, and the loss of some of their principal and best officers adds greatly to their sorrow. Besides this disastrous Event, a few Days after. 37 People were taken in a station upon Salt river, about 40 miles from the Falls. These successes will surely encourage the Shawanese to new Enterprizes. Kentuckey it is supposed does not contain above 1000 men at present, the general Part of the young men having come off this summer, as is commonly the case when Danger appears there. The Settlements are so much scattered, that it is difficult, and takes some Days to collect a Force together, particularly to go to any Distance from their own Families, when no other man knows what number of the Enemy have entered the Country, nor where the first Stroke will be made. The last Blow has cast a Gloom over the whole Country, and indeed Sir, their Distress is so great, that I need not attempt to describe it. And more- over, all accounts agree that there is Danger from the Wabash Indians, who are disgusted with our Procedings in their Country. ft is true numbers of People are now on the Road, moving out, but from the encumbrance of women, children and stock, the men will be of little service in fighting for the Country this year. And I am doubtful many of them will turn into Carolina towards the Cherokees where they may live in safety. If no succour is sent to Kentuckey, and the war with the British continues another Year, it is more than Proba- ble the whole of the Inhabitants will be killed, taken to Detroit or driven away: And when that is no longer a Barrier, Washington, Montgomery and Greenbrier must suffer. These Counties have suffered this year from small Parties, but Kentucky employs the attention of the Bulk of the Shawney Nation. Your Excellency will please to reflect that any Force which may be marched from Fort Pitt against their
Page 332
332 CALENDAE OF STATE PAPEES. 1782. immediate enemies, will be of no service to Kentuckey, or the Eest of Septem. 28th our Frontiers Southwest of Augusta, which seems to be the distance allotted to the Shawnese and Mingos. I believe Colo. Crawford's Expe- dition was against Sanduskey, and if General Irvine carries on another, it will probably be the same Course, and do as but little good— From your Excellencies known humanity and willingness to releive every Part of the Country under your Care, I can have no doubt, but you will readily fall upon any measures which may appear to you eligible for the Support of Kentuckey. I would therefore propose to your con- sideration the Expediency of having Garrisons erected upon the Ohio, and defended by regular Troops, as I hope you could spare a Eegiment from the lower Country. Besides the Falls, the mouth of Kentucky and mouth of Licking would be proper Places. Perhaps Spotswood's Legion could be sent out: Such of them as are equipt as Dragoons would be of essential service against Indians. Even musket men with bayonets would be of more use than it is generally thought: as the Indians of late depend more upon the use of their Tomhaks and Spears, than their Fire— In the mean time Sir. until something more permanent can be done for the country, I am induced to offer myself to your Excellency and the Council, to aim at raising five hundred Volunteers in the Counties of Augusta, Eockbridge, Greenbrier, Botetourt. Montgomery & Wash- ington to hasten out on Horseback. And when arrived there I would expect to be joined by what Force that country could spare, and would suppose the whole might form a Brigade of 1000 men: and with them I would hope to be able to make an excursion throughout the Shawnee country. Considering the Finances of our country, I should expect every man to find himself a Horse, arms and accoutrements, and also Provisions & Forage to carry him as far as Washington Court House, where some supply might be procured out of the Taxes of that Count}", to last from thence to Kentucky. I would wish to avoid all unneces- sary Parade & Expence, and also the being encumbered with Beeves or Pack-horses. I suppose the men would expect to have their Horses and accoutrements valued, & if lost, paid for at some future Day; and.no doubt they would think of being entitled to the same Pay as others m like service, & for the Provisions found themselves. The men who would go from here would not be too many for acting as mounted Infantry & Dragoons. Perhaps I could procure a few proper Horsemen from Henry, Bedford & Amherst. And I have a chance for some in Sullivan County upon Holston. Col: Preston of this County and Col: Campbell of Washington, have both offered me their assistance, and I expect I should have the assistance of the Officers in the other Counties. The season of the year may be thought unfavourable for such a scheme: but I conceive it would be no great obstacle to such men as would be excited to go from motives of Generosity &*zeal for the People of Ken- tuckey. Horses can live well all the winter at Kentuckey, and in the
Page 333
CALENDAR OF STATE PAPERS. 333 Shawney Country, and a successful attack upon Indians in the winter, 1782. would Distress them vastly more than at any other Season. If the Septem. 28th whole number of volunteers I mentioned cannot be got no doubt a con- siderable part can, and ever so few going out would Inspirit the People of Kentuckey, and give new life to their operations. Should your Excellency & the Council think well of my proposals, I hope you will hold out such encouragements for the Volunteers as you think Right; and give me such instructions and* Powers as you may judge proper. The Bearer Capt: MacCorkle will be able to give any further Information you ma}T want, and can convey your Orders to the several Counties & to me. I beg your Excellency to believe I have not the most distant wish to acquire any lasting Command in the Western Country; a few months will afford Time for all I expect to execute so that any Appointment you may vest me with, cannot interfere with any other Person there.. If the Plan is approved it endeavour to go through with it, And if not, I will not Doubt but your Excellency will do the best for that Country that you find can be done with a good Prospect. I am Sir, your most obedient & humble Servant." "Extract of a Letter from Col: Levi Todd to his Brother, Capt: Robt. Todd." Lexington, Aug: 26th. '82. "On the 16th Instant, in the morning an Express arrived from Bryant's Station informing us it was expected a Body of Indians lay round the Fort. I Set off with 30 men to see if it was so, and before I got there (which is five miles distant) was joined by 10 men from Daniel Boones. I found the Place surrounded & intended to force our way in. Seventeen of the foremost Horsemen rushed in; but being attacked at the mouth of a Lane; the remainder, some on Horseback, and myself and Ten others on Foot, were forced to retreat, leaving one man killed, and having three wounded, one of whom died next morning, but the other two will recover. Our Brother being over in Lincoln, I sent Expresses there desiring assistance. In the meantime, the Indians made a violent attack upon Bryants Fort and continued it all day & night: and a storm was expected. However they met with some Loss, and on the morning of the 17th went off. In the Evening, our Brother, Col: Trigg, and Major Macgary came with 130 men. On the morning of the 18th we collected 182 men ail on Horseback, and pursued the Enemy till 8 o'clock in the morning of the 19th, when we got sight of them forming in a Ridge in a Loop of the River, about three Quarters of a Mile North of the lower blue Lick and over the Licking. We had then pursued about 40 miles. We rode up within 60 yards, dismounted, gave & sustained a heavy and general Fire. The ground was equally favorable to both Parties and the Timber good. The left wing rushed on & gained near 100 yards of
Page 334
334 CALENDAE OF STATE PAPEES. 1782. ground. But the Eight gave way, and the Enemy soon flanked us on Septom. 28th that side, upon which the center gave way & shifted behind the left Wing. And immediately the whole broke in Confusion after the Action had lasted about five minutes. Our men suffered much in the Eetreat, many Indians having mounted our men's Horses, haveing open woods to pass through to the Eiver, and several were killed in the Eiver. Several efforts were made to rally, but all in Yain. He that could remount a horse was 'well off, and he that could not saw no time for delay. Our Brother received a Ball in his left Breast, and was on Horseback when the men broke. He took a course I thought Danger- ous, and as I never saw him afterwards, I suppose he never got over the Eiver. Col: Trigg, Major Harlin, Major Bulger, Captains McBride, Gordon, KinKead, and Overton fell upon the ground, also our friend James Brown. Our number missing is about seventy-five. I think the number of the Enemy was at least 300, but many of the men think five hundred. Colo. Logan with 500 men went to the ground on the 24th, and found & buried about 50 of our dead men. They were all stript naked, scalped, & mangled in such a manner that it was hard to know one from another. Our Brother was not known. As People in different parts of the Country will be anxious to know the names of the Killed, I will add a List of what I can now remember— Colo. John Todd, Col: Stephen Trigg—Major Silas Hardin, Major Edward Bulger—Captains Wm, McBride, John Gordon, Joseph Kinkead, and Cluff Overton—Lieutenants Wm.

Little more can now be bur£ done, but to guard the premises and take care of the effects, that nothing be lost, or injury done to the public property.

Lincoln Scy: at War to Majr: Genl: Greene. Septem. 30th "Dear Sir By the letter herewith (enclosed) from His Excellency General War Office Washington, which was sent to me under a flying seal, you will learn that the propriety or impropriety of removing'the Troops or any of them this Winter, is with you to determine. If you should think proper to remove any of the troops northward this fall, I wish you would send on the Delaware Corps, and the over- plus of a full Eegiment of each of the Maryland & Pennsylvania Troops. These with the recruits here will form one other Eegiment in each state. It will be much better to have the Eegiments formed, and the men as much as possible together, than to continue them in the detached state they have been for some time—for this idea however we are much indebted to you. I wish you would incorporate the Virginia Eegiments of Horse into one, on the Plan of Congress. I have also to request that you would form all the Continental troops with you, who have been enlisted either for the war, or three years, into proper Corps, as directed by the resolve of Congress of the 7th of August last, which I forwarded you some time since, and now inclose a duplicate. The moment you have taken your determinations what troops yon will retain, I wish to be informed whether they can or cannot be supplied with cloathing with you: of this I suppose there will be no doubt, in case Charles Town should be evacuated. Indeed we had better give almost any price, than think of sending from here. We have met with so many losses and delays, that we have little hope of success, should it be again attempted: however if the cloathing cannot be obtained for you, it must go from hence. I have the honor to be &c." (Copy.) Jno.

October 3d "Sir From Col: Christian and the accounts sent by Major Netherland, Washington the Executive may be fully informed of the State of the War in the -^ra^n t^e Kentucky Country. What if it should be the policy of the British Kentucky Ministry to drive in from the other side the Apalachian mountain before ^ountlT the signing the preliminaries of peace. At any rate they are uniting the Savage Tribes, and endeavoring to sow the seeds of deep laid animosity, which will lengthen the Indian war to a longer period than most imagine. Nothing now will put an end to it, but a decided blow in the enemies country, and a peace given them in the hour of their panic and misfortune, afterwards conducted by a proper Superintendency, or that Canada becomes ours, or our Allies. The method of arming and arraying our militia ought to be varied. Bayonets and The Bayonet and Scymeter must be introduced to enable us now to face Scymeter the Indians. And Evolutions suited to the woods should be learned both by Foot and Horse. All our late defeats have been occasioned thro'" neglect of these, and a want of a proper authority and capacity in the Commanding Officers. Never was the lives of so many valuable men lost more shamefully than in the late action of the 19th of August, and that not a little thro' the vain and seditious expressions of a Major Folly of Maj. McGeary. How much more harm than good can one fool do. Todd & Tod^and Trigg had capacity but wanted experience. Boone, Harlin and Lindsay Trigg had experience, but were defective in capacity. Good however would it Boone ^ Co- have been, had their advice been followed. Logan is a dull, narrow body from whom nothing clever need be expected.

In a department where October 19th business hath been as Various and Extensive as this hath, there can be no Doubt of many Errors being committed, many hath been detected.

Jealous of their importance, Embrace that declamatory principal so very agreeable to such bodies, suposing by striking at the principal characters of their Country, that Strangers will View them as men of consequence. The Credit that is given to such characters near the helm of affairs, I can assure you S'r hurts the Interest of the State greatly. The expences in this depart- ment hath been considerable, but had it not been for them and the con- sequential service, we should have been obliged before this to have spent five times as much in defence of our frontiers, and Except some Expences that have proved unnecessary, as a citizen, I am satisfied with the pro- priety of the whole.

Otherways the Country would have unavoidably been lost. The plan of an Expedition against the Shawanees is now on foot, and I believe will take place.

When I wrote to Col: Davis (Davies) respecting the appointments that Col: White had made, I was told the only difficulty in obtaining a confirmation of their appointment was my not having signified my wishes to the Governor of this State on the subject, and that the State Colo. would confirm nothing at the instance of Colo.

From these considerations I wrote Col: Davis on the subject in general terms, not doubting but that Col: White had confined his appointments to such limitations, as appeared to be consistent with a just economy and the constitution of his regiment. This not being the case, I can do nothing in the matter until I am better informed. I wish your Excellency therefore to let the matter rest until you hear further from me, or something more conclusive is done by the Minister Thanks, &c of War on the subject.

I adopted this mode, in preference to discharging them as their time of service expired, that the State might have it in its power to try to reinlist them, as Colo. Davis advised to, but to make the attempt here, and to try to obtain money of the State for the purpose.

As for my part I hold peace in the one Hand and war in the other, but am desirous to receive any friendly persons in friendship than hold them in contempt, the Americans never made it a practice of purchasing friendship as the English has hitherto accustomed, because they are Sensible that bought friendship is corrupted with Treachery, as plainly is seen by the differ- ent nations of red people to the northward who hath with the greatest zeal and assiduity sought for the Succour of the Americans when too late. Brothers I am Sensible that you are unacquainted with the founda- tions of this War, a part of which I do here lay before you. the Eng- lish and the Americans even as one family, but the English grew proud and thought themselves our superiourers. that we should to deprived of our Liberties and rights and like servile slaves, support them with our Labour, but our spirits would not admit us to Condescend to such Impositions—in opposition to their Tyrannical proceedings we took arms in defence of ourselves. Brothers, you know that we furnished the several nations with manu- factures before the war began and are able to furnish the Same to this day and I hope Ever will be to Those who are true friend to the Ameri- cans—and those that choose to hold us in contempt, we will as fondly furnish them with powder and Ball to the Destruction of their men, women and children. Brothers, I have one more circumstance to lay before you. The French, the Spaniards & the Americans are as one family, and this family com-

Six Strings of Wampum. Brothers, what I have said to you is from my Heart—this paper that I now deliver to you contains the Substance of my business, it is the Talk from the beloved man in consequence of the one you sent to him, in reading that you read his Heart, all the Nations are Witnesses that he always Speaks the Truth as the Sky is now clear. I hope—I hope that peace and Amity will imediately take Place, that you send him an answer that may further convince him that he need not look any more with a bloody Eye towards this Land. The winter is near at hand & I have a great way home. I hope to receive your answer as soon as possible I am your Brother, (In the presence of Capt: ^ Eobt. George and James Sha- [ lock, Indian Interpreters. Answer from Piamathihaw, Mmohomah, Piamingo, Chambeau, the Eed King and Several other Sachams and Warriers. Brothers, We received your Talk and the speech of the beloved man and are happy to think the Sky is Clear and mount the throne of Peace and Unity and Smoke together in the Countenance of true Brother- hood. We have had this long time a Desire to take hold of our beloved man by the hand & make our case known to him, that we were con- strained by the Council of bad people to hold our beloved man in con- tempt, but our wisdom hath taught us to the contrary. The English put the Bloody Tomahawk into our hands, telling us that we should have no Goods if we did not Exert ourselves to the greatest point of Eesentment against you, but now we find our mistake and Distresses. The English have done their utmost and left us in our adversity. We find them full of Deceit and Dissimulation and our women & children are crying out for peace, from their move we were daily Expecting to be destroyed by him, but have found an expected mercy from his hand, but this speech gives us pleasure and chears the heart of all our warriers, and now Brothers let us light the old Council Fire and Smok together, let us bury the bones of our slain on both sides and forgett all. let us think on the old Friendship that ware formerly Between us and the Americans our Brothers. Let the Eoads and water courses be open clear and sincear friendship be planted. Whenever we meet Brothers, we shall endeavour to confirm our brothers the red people of our acquaint- ance to the same Sentiments.

JOSEPH CROCKETT TO Gov: HARRISON OF Va. "Sir Charlottes- I received your Excellency's letter of the 16th Instant, the purport Virginia °^ wn^CQ ^ arn at a ^oss to answer so clearly as I could wish, as for Genl: Clark's conduct, last campaign whilst I had the honor to serve under his com'd (as touching his military character) I cannot think he is deserving censure, his greatest misfortune k loss of usefull operations of the campaign, was the want of men, altho' the Genl: strain'd every nerve in his power, to raise a sufficient number to penetrate into the heart of the Enemj^'s Country, and was assisted by a small number of good men, to complete his Laudable design, it appeared to me to be out of the power of any human Existance to cause a sufficient number to Enter the field, or subject those few that were already there to good order. the Genl: often told them of the evils that has already befell them, if that campaign miscarried. One place of General Bendezvous was Wheel: ing, where the genl: expected to be joined with a thousand militia from the Counties over the mountains: onto! which two hundred & fifty only joined, and the half of them deserted after drawing a quantity of arms, Blankets, Leggins, shirts &c. &c.—the greatest part of those that did not desert, threatened mutiny for Several days, nor was this all the Genl's disappointment, there was a certain Quota of men to be sent him from the Counties of Berkeley, Frederick & Hampshire, of which he never received one.

CALENDAR OF STATE PAPERS. I know the Genl: is much censured in the neighbourhood of Fort Pitt, 178: Fort Pitt, for the Loss of Colo. Laugherry's party, for whom he waited October five days at Wheeling: disappointments being so frequent, he lost all hopes of his coming, and moved down the River, the Colo, coming to Wheeling the next day, sent a boat after, with a Letter to the Genl: that he would be glad If he would wait for him, as he had One hundred & thirty men without provisions, the Genl: sent a small boat with ten Keggs of Flour, and wrote the Colo, he would leave Boats enough at a certain Island under a small guard, for the reception of his men, with a quantity of Flour, Ammunition &c.—to prevent desertion, he would move slowly down the river, the unhappy Colo, without proper caution, Landed his men at the mouth of the Maamma, at which place was a large number of Indians, who destroyed the whole of the Colo's party. The Genl: purchased of Mr. Gibson, at Fort Pitt, a considerable Quantity of goods, Liquorers, Sugar, Coffee, Tea &c, which the officers in general accuse him of making a very unequal distribution. It was thought there was one more instance in which General Clark derogated much from the Importance of his trust, there was a Mr. Ellett who traded to New Orleans with 5000 wt. Flour, he stored his flour at a Mr. Newel's, who lived at a place cal'd the new Store on the Monongalia. Said Newel took the Flour in his care, who was also employed by the purchasing Commissary to receive public Flour: Mr. Ellett took the opportunity of going down the river with the Genl:— when we came to the Falls of Ohio, the river being very low, Ellett was under the necessity of unloading his boat to descend the Falls, and carry his flour over the falls in small Crafts: he unloaded near the place where the public flower was landed (of which we had a large Quantity, near 4,000 Keggs). 1 saw Mr. Ellet taking flower from the Bulk of the public. I asked him how he came so to do. his answer was "don't you think that damn'd old Newell at the new store, has misplaced sixty Keggs of my superfine flower, and I must take sixty of your Corse." I immediately informed the Commissary, his answer was "the Gen'l knows it." I asked Mr. Ellett what mark his keggs had. he told me all his was manufactured at William Henshaws mill, and the Barrels was Branded with the two first Letters of his name. Some few days after this Mr. Ellett sail'd down the River, there was a Mr. Randolph who came down the River with us & who had formerly transacted business for Genl: Clark to the westward. I never heard him mention going with Ellett untill the morning he set sail and then went on Bord Ellett's Boat—this affair gave every man reason to suspect . The Genl: some few days afterwards Issued an order for the whole of the flower to be sifted and Repacked (as it had received damage coming down the River). 1 told the Sergeant & several of the soldiers who were appointed for that duty, that I would give them a treat, if they would let me know where they found a kegg Branded W. H. contained finer flower than the rest, I wanted to draw for my own use. I enquired fre-

Notwithstanding this "a Mr. Goosley who thinks himself superior to the rest of his fellow citizens" had given great trouble in this business. Mr. Gibbons had carried off much of this wood which he had ordered the soldiers to carry back &c. Goosley presuming upon his forbearance had grossly insulted him in his room, behaving with great insolence, and threatening unless the wood was returned "he would play the devill with us all." Asks if there was no protection against the insolence of civilians. He could only account for this Conduct on the part of Goosley & others from the fact, that the presence of the military at that place and at Hamp- ton served to prevent the running "of immense quantities of goods" into the state in the flag vessels from New York, "a crime that too many will be found guilty of." Mr. Gibbons had sued him for taking the wood out of his yard, and thinks he had done nothing wrong in carrying off wood which did not belong to him.

The disturbed and critical condition of that country and the difficulty of procuring an Express had prevented him from giving the government the information he desired to send. Continues—"I have in a former let'r I think given you satisfactory Eeasons why the Posts alluded to was not built, preparations ware made early in the spring for the execution of your orders, but a full Acc't of the designs of the Enimy caused us to alter our plans—pru- dence directed that we should not enter on too large a scale—the Forti- fications at the falls was first to be repaired, proceed to Kentucky, from thence to Licking & compleating our works in Eotation—but in the execution of this business I had not only to counteract the design of the Enemy, but a powerfull party indeavouring to subvert the gov- ernment, of which I have reason to believe, that great part of those whome give your Excell'y so much Intelligence belong. Those and many other Resent circumstances caused us to meet with difficulties in drawing out the Militia, hardly to be surmounted with the assistance of many worthy gentlemen in office—I found that it was impossible to Build those posts without the greatest probability of sacrificing a party, *The latter part of this letter is lost.

After six days being within Eighty-six miles Novem. 30th of the Body of the Enimy, and the clamours of Eaven those people Risk of whome I suspect to have made their complaint to you was that such menS&<f post could not he supported and of no consequence, though I believe it not to be the real sentiments of the whole, but rather to disapoint the design, to save themselves from the duty—Eeceiving repeated Intelli- gence from the Enimy we endeavoured to fix on the most likely plan to save the country. Colo. Todd's militia was excused from all other duty Measures but that of keeping out proper scouts and spies on the Ohio and Else- ^e whare to discover the approach of the Enemy, to give time & to Imbody Country &c. a sufficient force to Eepell them, as it could not be previously done, not certainly knowing in what quarter they would make their stroke, instead of those necessary duties being done in which their salvation apparently depended, the Enimy was suffered to penetrate deliberately into the bowels of their Country and make the attack before they ware discovered, this I beleive is what is wished to be blinded, and the Cause of the neglect to be one of the principal springs to that mad pursuit and car- g^^^ narge of the Blue Licks, as the Eeverse of fortune would have obliviated the former neglect. I must confess that I have been defitient in my duty in not given you an ac't of every circumstance attending this unhappy Keasons why affair, but hope to be excused as it was only owing to my Delicacy in lie nad not referred to affecting the memory of the gentlemen who Fell, not conceiving it to tnat affair be of singular advantage to government, and knowing it would fix an Eternal Stigmy on others Characters, but as the Scale has turned to the amazement of many, I shall amediately collect every circumstance rela- tive to the whole affair for you perutial." * * * * * He begs the Governor not to listen to further complaints, and feels persuaded that if he knew "the true character of many of these gentle- men" that he would never refer to them again. Gives as apology for this remark, the zeal he has for the public interest, and the estimate he has of his goodness. Eefering again to the memorial from Fayette Co. he adds, it was "to cover their misconduct, and a prelude to a Maj'rs Real object Commission for a Triffle and a Col's for a person something more deserv- of the. ing, to the prejudice of a valuable man Mr. Swearingin, their former memona Major who had been absent for some time and was Dayly expected, which would have prevented their design, to my certain knowledge they now dread the Execution of what a few of them were deluded to pray for again, Col: Donoldson, who was last spring chairman of the Co] j)onaj_ Committee that endeavoured to subvert the Government and cost us soe son at- much trouble to overset, since bearing an important Commission &c. ^se^the* * * * * * * Government 49

They had deferred making any further purchases from private indi- viduals, prefering that the State should not be encumbered with a debt for stores, which should be borne by the U. States. Rather than annoy the Cher: de la Luzerne in regard to the direct importation of the stores from France to Virginia, they had thought it best to communicate with Mr. Morris, as to the chances of affecting that object, under his auspices: but it was uncertain how far this channel could be relied upon. * This part is in cypher, interpreted.

Smith declining to serve on the Board, oix this account able to fill the vacancy thus caused. He had not taken an escort from Washington Co., as authorized by his Excellency, but had ventured through the wilderness in rather a small party, and after twenty three days journey had arrived safely but done very little busi- ness. This was owing to the people having been out in the forces sent against the Shawanee Towns. The death and removal of many persons connected with the transactions in that County, into which the Com- missioners were to look, would retard the business very seriously. There was good reason to know that "the greatest abuses" had been com- mitted in that Department. The printed notices of the proposed meet- ing of this Board not having come to hand, he had caused written ones to be despatched to "the Illinois" summoning Col: Le grass and others. Neither Mr. Bullock, Mr. Barbour, or Mr. Shannon were in that Country, on this account the business would be much delayed. Lindsay and Harrison being both dead, their papers were left in great confusion.

"Sir, Great Island I came to this part of the Country a few Days ago & was informed by Colo. Martin that a party of Cherokee Indians were here, on their way to Eichmond, and desired me to assist him in turning them Home again. Accordingly I attended to-day, and we had some Talk with them, which Colo. Martin will communicate to your Excellency. The Deplorable miseries of those People, from what I see and hear seem to exceed ^he^Chero^ ^e8Cripti°nj here are men, women and children almost naked—I see kees very little to cover either sex, but some old Bear skins, and we are told the Bulk of the Nation, are in the same naked situation. But this is not the greatest of their Evils: their crops this year have been worse than was ever known, so that their corn and Potatoes, it is supposed, will be all done before April. And many are already out, particularly Widows and Fatherless Children. * * * * In their Commonwealth their is no provision made for distressed Families, and such as cannot provide for Themselves, seldom get any assistance. The great Scarcity of Amunition makes their case still more deplorable. If they had a supply, all the Families who have Hun- ters among them could procure meat, which would enable them to live on a while in hopes of better days. Besides, it is in vain for your Excellency to send them Goods without Ammunition, because without, they can procure no skins to pay for them. We are informed that the Creeks upon the Mobilles as well as the Shawnese have threatened the Cherokees; and in their unprepared situation may force them to disturb Suggests our settlements. Indeed Sir, it appears to me that a moderate supply measures for Qf Ammunition and goods would be a means of averting all the misery their relief f ° J &c. attending these People, as well as save many of our own frontiers. On this subject I have a word more to add. We are told that some hundreds of those Iudians must inevitably die with Hunger, unless something is done for them; and it appears to me that the most speedy and certain way to releive the widow & the orphan, would be to allow Col: Martin to purchase two or three hundred Bushels of Corn to distribute as their necessities may require. I find that the party here, consisting of fifty odd, are living on Col: Martin's corn. Whenever a family begins to be in a starving condition, it is very probable they will push for this Place and throw them themselves upon him for Bread. I am your Excellency's most humble Serv't, &c, &c.

"Dear Sir, Mahanaine I was lately down Holston near the Island, when Col: Mar- tin the Virginia Agent for Indian Affairs informed me there were a number of Cherokees in the Island who intended to go on to Richmond. This he seemed very desirous to prevent, supposed it would be a disa- greable visit to your Honourable Board. He showed me a letter from his Excellency our Governer, in which a wish seemed to be expressed that 1 should assist and advise him when opportunity offered. We then Indians per- went into the Island, and after some Talk with the Indians they agreed ^cfto Rich10 to return DOme again. We took down in writing all that passed, which mond with Letters from Colo. Martin and myself to his Excellency upon the same subject, we sent by Colo. John Taylor, who was present & who was to deliver the Papers as he returned to Caroline. After writing the Letters by Mr. Taylor, Col: Martin and myself had a good deal of Conversation about his situation, where he is as an agent for Virginia. As soon as we talked a little about it, I saw the impro- priety of it, and we agreed that I should write to you upon the subject. And in order to give you a better Idea of the Country, I have scratched Map of that down a rough map* of that Part of it which now comes in question, country rr.ne is|an(j js jn North Carolina about ten miles: and in my opinion, it Carolinians is not very agreable to the North Carolinians for Us to have a Trade and Agency in that State: although they don't complain much about it, being greatly pleased with the Complaisance, and Politeness of Governor Harrison. The settlements down the River, extend about 30 miles, and to the Southwest and South much more. The only way the Indians can come Dangers to to the Island in safety is up the River; and even on that Rout they which friend-have suffered. Two of their men noted friends to the White People ly Indians . . 1 are exposed were murdered last summer, on the Itiver, within the settlements, as they were bringing up a Canoe with skins and Furrs to the Island. Col: Martin, knew, took and confined the murderers three in number: and although men in no Repute, were rescued by a Body of Armed men *This map referred to is to be found enclosed in this letter.
Page 407
CALENDAE OF STATE PAPEES. 407 their Neighbors in a few Hours. And since that two other Indians 1782. were Killed about the lower settlements. These Inconveniences obliged Decern. 30th Col: Martin to go all the way to the nation, with the goods the Execu- tive furnishes him with, which adds considerably to the Expenses attend- ing the Trade. And if Public business is to be done, it is a great Eisk to bring the Indians to the Island. What I mean then to submit to your consideration, is the removing State Agency of the Store and Agency to Cumberland Gap. The Gap lies directly ^^ed^o betwixt the Lines of Henderson and Walker, but a Post might be fixed Cumberland within both, to be certainly in Yirginia, as the lines are but 2$ miles Gap &c* asunder. The Gap is near half way betwixt our settlements on Holston and Kentuckey, and a post there would be a resting Place for our poor citizens going back and foward & would be a great means of saving the Lives of Hundreds of them. For it very seldom happens that Indians will kill People near where they Trade: and it is thereabouts the most of the mischief on the Eoad has been done. The best hunting ground the Cherokees now have is down Tennessee & up Powell's valley to * Cumberland Gap: there being certain fixed Bounds betwixt them and the Chicasaws and Creeks over which neither must trespass. And at anv rate the Gap is nearer to the Towns than the Island: more conve- nient for their Trade, and more safe on account of our own People. Besides wherever an Agent is, Indians will be every now and then coming to him. In Powell's valley they could, for some time to come furnish themselves with Provisions. At the Island they have no chance but to live upon Col. Martin. It has however, been the case for a long Time past, for I am convinced all the pay he gets from the State would not buy the Provisions he has to give away to them. If our Trade should be increased, I dare say Powell's river is navigable for canoes, and would answer that End as well as at Holston. Col: Martin could easily procure a number of Families to join him Col: Martin and erect a Station next Spring in Powell's Valley, and would willingly ^eJfin do it, if directed so to do by Government. Notwithstanding I think the establishing Pay of half a dozen or a dozen men for a few months at the Beginning p^well's* would be well laid out. Indeed I always thought our State ought to have Valley kept a Post at the Gap. There is a noted place called Martin's 20 miles above the Gap, where there was a Station some years ago, that might answer. But the Gap is much to be preferred to any other. Col: Mar- tin is a Field Officer in our Washington, and I should suppose there need be no officer in Pay at his Station; and no other expence attending the men, if any are ordered, but their Pay and Provisions. I view the change I propose, as of great Importance to the Frontiers of Washington; to our Peoples Journeying to and from Kentucky; particularly the poor families moving out; to the Indian Trade and to the Indian Agency in general. Will you then Sir, be pleased to reflect a little upon the subject, and state it to his Excellency our Governor, and our Honourable Council?
Page 408
408 CALEJSTDAB OF STATE PAPEBS. 1782. I know of no views but the Public good, that Martin or myself could Decern. 30th have in this change. I have therefore to stipulate with you Sir, that if Character of the proposition is disliked, that the Blame may fall on me alone. I wish ^ &c*artin ^° mention to you that I have been well acquainted with Col: Martin's Transactions, and management for more than 6 years past, and have always observed him to be a faithful, trusty servant to the Public; Act- ing at all times fairly and openly, without respect to the censure or applause of the lawless or licentions. I have always found him a man of the greatest candour and Integrity in all his dealings Public and private; and I verily believe the back country does not afford a man so fit in all .Respects as he is for your Agent. I am sure he has been with- in an Inch of loosing his life in the service, when a man of less zeal for the Country's welfare would have shunned the Danger. In short Sir, he is a undesigning, plain, honest, brave man, and understands the manners and disposition of the Indians better than any Body I know; Besides he is held in great esteem by all Banks of them. It is for fear Col. Martin has been or may be traduced by men unacquainted with his merit, that I trouble you upon this Head; and am satisfied it will give you pleasure to know that those in Trust, under the Direction of your Board are honest men. I have been looking for some of our back members to get news from the Assembly, but have heard of none returning yet. Pray if you have anything that is no Secret, will you write me a few Lines at leisure Times. I am Sir, with Bespect your obed't Serv't." &c. &c. Decern. 30th Wm.

The general opinion at that Place was that there would not be a very speedy Peace. Should the war continue, he thinks the French Ministry would furnish the loan wanted by Virginia. The loan for Pennsylvania might be effected in Holland, but the merchants of Amsterdam preferred making advances to Virginia, because the pay- ment of Interest could be made by that State in an Article (Tobacco) which always commanded cash, and of which there was a constant con- sumption, &c.

Steps neces- sary to pro- tect the in- habitants 'Sir, On Chrismas day last the Indians attacked the house of John Ingles on Clinch in this county, scalped and otherwise greivously wounded, a young man of the name of Cox, overtaken in ye field, the second day afterwards as they enemy was making off towards the head of Sandy-River, came on three hunters, two of whom they killed. This attack at so uncommon a season, and notwithstanding- Genl: Clarke's success, has dishartened the whole settlement of Clinch greatly—in-so- much that they have generally come to a resolution to abandon the river early in the Spring, if some apparantly effectual measures are not set on foot for their protection—A Fort erect on Sandy-River, west of the Laurel Ridge seems to me the only probable measures. A negotiation for peace with the northward Tribes may do great things; yet it will not be certain but several small parties will annoy us thro' the summer if some active exertions are not early made to intimidate and prevent them." "I should not be so importunate on this subject were I not fully per- suaded of the danger that may be expected from a Tribe lately initiated, but not subded, and who will at last be secretly supported from Detroit notwithstanding all Carlton has promised—Some of our Countrymen lately from Canada gives various and well evidenced reasons for this opin- ion. Since my return from Richmond I addressed the Governor on this subject, and should not again have troubled an}: of the Gentlemen of the Executive had it not been, that I was lately waited on by a deputation of officers from Clinch, informing me of the fixed resolution of the inhabi- tants, as above stated, &c.

CALENDAR OF STATE PAPERS. 425 The Falls is beyond a doubt a proper station for a garrison, but it is 1783. of no more use to the upper and middle Country than a Post on James Jan'y 29th River would be to the people on Potomack. I rather judge Limestone to be the most suitable Place, and that a hundred men would be a sufficient number for a Garrison there. It would be a proper Place for the ^Rendezvous of Troops going into the Shawney Country, and for the Debarkation of Families moving down the Ohio. The other advantages arising from a Post there, I need not explain, as they will in a moment occur to your Excellency. There is one however I have just thought of that I will mention. At Limestone or Licking would be a proper station for an armed vessel to cruize from, The River to up and down the River. But it ought to be light and manageable for ^ P™^^ twenty or thirty men, which number in a proper constructed vessel vessel &c. would be strong enough to attack any number of Indians in Canoes. There is one thing I will mention, and although it may appear Selfish, yet you ought to be acquainted with it. Fayette County is the most Fayette Co., exposed to the Enemy, of any County in the State, or perhaps in America, the ex~ and if neglected, the Inhabitants will I dare say from Report, move away in great numbers to Cumberland in North Carolina: and if the present Inhabitants makes a Break I don't know where any others would be found to take their Places. I am informed by Letters from Kentucky that the People seem pretty easy just now, being amused False secu- with an account of a Cessation of Arms betwixt us and our Enemies: and °f Kentucky some other accounts of General Carlton's having proposed to stop hos- tilities, from the Indians. The latter we hear often by travellers from Pennsylvania. Be those matters as they may, I have very slender Hopes that the Shawnees will regard either Carlton or Haldimand's Talks, in any short Time; besides the Doubt I have of Carlton's sincer- ity. And therefore I guess the People exposed ought to make Prepa- rations for an early and vigorous attack. Small Parties have already been on our Frontiers: and near the Falls of Ohio. Their success will send out others, in spite of any vague and doubtful orders from their generals at ten or twelve hundred miles distance. I am your Excellencies obedient servant. Wm.

That all ye other nations are this Spring, to Imbody in the neighborhood of Detroit & march from there with a party of British forces against Fort Pitt; from thence to the Falls of Ohio & Kentucky, & from thence to the Illinois in order to take the above places and destroy the Kaskaskian Indians, as they are sure of success. This appears to be their design and plan for this year.

I expect they will be back some time in March. At their arrival in the Cherokee Country I am to have Immediate notice. Therefore if your Excellency should think proper to order about 100 Horsemen to hold themselves in readiness, they might be easily cut off before they could cross the Ohio. I am told they have dispatches from the Commander at Detroit to the Commander at Samt Augustine; in all probability if they could be defeated on their way home, which I think is Easily Effected, we then should be made acquainted with all their secret plans of war. Your Excellency's instructions respecting the Treaty with the Southern Tribes has not come to hand. Col: Donaldson have been waiting since the 2d of last month on that business, and waits your Excellency's Instructions. Maj'r Reid who I have Imploid to carry these dispatches, has also engaged to go to the Chekecaws' Nation, to fix the time of meeting at the Cumberland River, he is a person whose Diligance & Fidelity may be depended on. And I presume that it would be highly necessary he should be Enabled to make a good Apperance, to strike the Attention of the Indians where he is to go, as it may answer a good purpose with Those people.

February 3d "Sir, ^Head Your favor of the 24th of December, with the several enclosures I Charles have had the honor to receive. I am much obliged to you and the Th^k^f Council for your generous confidence in my integerity, and hope every the confi- Part °f mY conduct will continue to merit it. I am sensible with you, dence r®; of Checking improper suspicions, and of the impropriety of the liberty Mr. Banks took even in a Confidential Letter. There is nothing but the surmise that applies to me—If you will read his Letter, you will see the special privileges granted him even by the enemy, not by me—He never had a flag from me, nor any other indulgence whatever. How Banks He went into Town from George Town under Col: Lushington's flag, g0t truceS °f anc* came out t0 Camp under the Enemy's flag with liberty to return again, and this obtained by his friends in Charles Town at the same time that it was refused to eveiy Body else. When it was known that the Enemy intended to evacuate this place, a number of merchants made application to the Governor and Council for liberty to remain here with their goods. The peculiar situation of this Country induced them to consent to it. Before the evacuation Mr. Banks made large purchases of these Merchants: and some little time before it took place, he came out to Camp, where he was introduced to me, before which I had never seen him. Steps to pro- Having received orders from Genl: Lincoln to procure clothing for forlhe°arm g ^G ariT)y almost at any price, and seeing it would be impossible to get it &c. from the northward, and the troops in a suffering condition, I consulted Mr. Banks upon the practicability of procuring an assortment for Bills on Mr. Morris—He offered his services, and told me that if I could advance about 1200 Guineas he thought he could procure the Goods 20 pr: cent, lower of the same Merchants before the Enemy left the Town, than afterwards. I advanced him the money, and drew him a sett of Bills, the same mentioned in his Letter, and forwarded by Major Forsyth, and wrote to General Lincoln the steps I had taken to procure the cloathing, as you will see by a copy of my Letter to him of the 11th of November—I have been thus particular, that you might comprehend the whole transaction; and that you might have it in your power to Genl. Scott's inform General Scott, that the imposition he imagines he had discovered suspicion un- j^as n0 foundation, for the Bills were drawn for the public service, and the Secretary at war advised thereof—How far Mr. Banks has dealt generously in the prices of the purchases he has made, I cannot pretend to say, having never examine the invoices. Notwithstanding the agree- ment made with Mr. Banks, I gave the Clothier, as you will see by a Efforts to get copy of his instructions, to try all the Merchants, generally, intending goods cheap to plirchase of him who would serve the public on the best terms. But unfortunately the Merchants would not sell for Bills on any terms, and this made an obligation the greater, to Mr. Banks, who furnished us

T have been obliged to 1783. draw Bills for two months pay for the officers—Mr. Banks has given February 3d those credit also, when few or no other Merchants in Town would. Every Merchant will make his advantages, and I suppose Mr. Banks has done it in the price of his goods furnished the officers. I did not know that Major Burnet had engaged in business with him Major Bur- untill a few days ago. I know he had it in contemplation, and intended net &c' to leave the Army to go into business, his friends approving thereof: but I understood him every thing would be conditional untill he con- sulted them. However, all his engagements must have taken place after the evacu- ation: and it was my intention he should have been out of my Family before he entered into any business. Lest there should remain a shadow of doubt respecting Mr. Banks' surmise, I herewith enclose you a copy of certificate* sworne to before Henry Pendleton Judge of the Superior Court of this State. I am not conscious of having done anything in my whole life that Precautions should render a measure of this sort necessary, but as I cannot tell what pero7eSctrhis° lengths jealousies ma}^ run, and knowing that public officers should be representa- like Ceasar's Wife, not only innocent, but free from suspicions, I take tlon the liberty to trouble you with this Certificate, if anything of the kind should be insinuated, that you would do me the justice to which Mr. Banks' imprudence, and Genl: Scott's indelicacy have exposed me. Mr. Banks took a very improper liberty, nor can I imagine what he could ground it on, unless it was from my saying to him that Major Burnet had Probable thoughts of leaving the Army, and going into business, if the Enemy Qe^USg^t>s should evacuate Charles Town; and should he go into business, as he suspicion had long been in my Family he would oblige me by rendering him any services in his power. Mr. Banks has entered into contract with Lt: Col: Carrington for the subsistence of the Army; and he was the only Person who could be found to make an offer, altho' the army were starv- ing, and subsisted with the point of the Bayonet. I only mention this lest you should have a more unfavorable opinion of Mr. Banks than he deserves. How far his going into Town in the first instance was justi- fiable, I cannot decide on. The transaction was known by the civil authority of this state, and it lay with them to punish him, if he had exceeded the priveledges of a Citizen belonging to another State. I have the honor to be your Excellency's mo: obt. Servt." &c. &c. "Extract of a Letter from Genl Greene to Genl. Lincoln—Nov: lli/i, 1782. Gives Genl.

I imagine our purchases will amount to February 3d not less than 40,000 dollars, for which I shall draw Bills on the Finan- cier: and as I provide this cloathing at your instance, and by your order, I hope you will prepare the Financier for the drafts, that the Bills may be punctually paid. I have already drawn in favor of Messrs. Banks & Comp'y for 8,000 Dollars in Bills of Different value to secure the cloathing: and by this step I am in hopes to save at least 20 pr: ct. on the Goods. I am to advance also 1200 guineas, which I am in hopes to get of Mr. Hall the Continental Receiver. You will please to inform Mr. Morris that I have applied, and propose to appropriate this sum to the payment of the Cloathing—If in anything I have exceeded your intentions, you will please to inform me. My esti- mates are barely sufficient for covering the Troops, and as I am informed the Northern Army is compleatly clad, and as you mention a desire that this should, I have laid out accordingly as far as the Articles neces- sary for the purchase could be had.

CALENDAE OF STATE PAPEES. 431 The principal topics of conversation that passed between us I will 178^. endeavour to give you, as far as my recollection will avail me. lie com- February 3d plains that they are wholly without Law or G-overnment: that their Magistrates, from Indolence or sinister views, having for some time been relax in the Execution of their Office, are now altogether without authority: that crimes of the greatest enormity may be committed with Impunity, and a man be murdered in his own House and no person regard it: that they have no Sheriff nor Prison: and to crown the gen- eral Confusion, that man}T people have made large purchases of three or four hundred Leagues, and are endeavouring to have themselves established Lords of the Soil, as some have done in Canada, and have settlements made on these purchases, composed of a set of men wholly subservient to their views. As a remedy to those Greivances, he would recommend that a Presi- dent of Judication be sent them, with Executive powers to a certain Extent, and that subordinate civil officers be appointed to reside in each village or station, who should have powers to hear and decide all causes upon Obligations not exceeding three hundred Dollars, but that those which were given for more, the adjusting and settling all accounts what- ever, and determining finally upon all intricate and important Questions should be reserved for the Court, which might be held at Haskaskias: and consist of the President and a majority of the magistrates. He wishes the Grant in which the Kaskaskias Settlements lie could be considered as making one District; it contains five villages, of which Kaskaskias and Kohokia are the principal. The Grant reaches from Piaza to Amaric, about ninety miles along the Mississippi, and back from the Eiver as far as the Illinois extends, that is to the Lakes. (I doubt the extent of the Grant to the X. E.) The Tract comprehended within these limits he informs me, was by Solemn Treaties, granted to the Settlers by the Indians, and has never been disputed by them. He further observes that there is no man in that Country whose abilities and Influence by any means capacitates him for the office of President; and he believes it would be absolutely necessary for a year or two, to have a company of Eegulars stationed in the Country, who should be under the direction of the President; otherwise he conceives their decrees would not be carried into execution, as the Licentiousness of the People has risen to such a height. He seems anxious to encourage Population among them, and as an encouragement to adventurers to migrate thither, he wishes the President were vested with powers of granting Lands in moderate Quantities (for he appears afraid of monopolies) to such as chose to become Inhabitants of their Country. He says the Spaniards have the liberty of trading up any of their Eivers on the east side of the Mississippi, while they are prohibited by the Governor of Pancore to enter any one Eiver on the Spanish side, and that the}r ardently wish proper representations were made of the matter, that they might enjoy reciprocal advantages with their neigh-

He complains that the Eoard of Commissioners have not settled the obligations which were given, payable in Peltry agreeable to the known Eule and constant practice of the Ilinois Country, which is, when a note is given tor 50 lbs: in Peltry, for Instance, and the obligor fails to pay in Peltry, that then he is considered as bound to pay 100 Livres in money. My own observations to him, I presume, are unnecessary to communi- cate to you, though if you desire it, I shall upon being notified thereof, at any Time be ready to do it. As by your Commission, you might be empowered to enquire into the Situation of the Country of Ilinois, and state their grievances to Government, I thought the above narrative might not be without its use.

Nelson" Garrison. Present, Majr. George Walls Capt: George, Lieut: Eich'd Clark, Capt. Bailey, Lieut. Williams, Capt Chaplain, Lieut. W. Clark. The Officers, after consultation & mature deliberation find that the Garrison in its present situation, is by no means equal to the importance of the place. That there is not above one third of the men necessary for its defence, and in a short time the unavoidable casualties will reduce the number to not more than twenty or thirty men. That there is not more than three months Flower in store, not one pound of meat, and no possibility of procuring a sufficiency by the usual method of hunting* That there is not a sufficiency of lead to defend the Garrison twenty four hours in case of an assault. Some parts of the Fortifications going to wreck, and not men to make the necessary repairs. Also that the men appear to be on the Verge of mutiny in consequence of having served so long without receiving pay & other necessaries, and no pros- pect of an alteration for the better. These considerations and the daily expectation of the Enemy now in the opening of the Spring induce the officers to conceive, that without some speedy remedy is taken they may be reduced to the shocking alterna- tive of evacuating the Post. And should either its fall or the Evacua- tion happen, for want of the necessary supplies they cannot think them- selves answerable for the consequences, being conscious of having done their dut}^ as officers. But as it is the determination of officers & men to defend the Post to the last extremity (being sensible of its importance) wish only for the means, And hoping that something may be speedily done for the better support of the Department, Majr: Walls is hereby desired to lay this, with the State of the Garrison, before the General, requesting him to make the necessary alterations or Amendments, and lay the same before the Commiss'rs, or take such other measures as he may think most proper.

"Sir Feb'v 21st * % * * * * £'The situation of my affairs in this quarter has not admitted of my Charlestown being in Virginia as early as I wished, and it will still be somu time before I can come. In the mean time I am advancing respectable paj'- ments to my creditors there, on account towards their debts, which will satisfy them till I can arrive to make a final close of their claims. My resignation of Deputy Qaurter Master General took place on the first of January, when I was to have proceeded immediately to Virginia; but no successor has yet been appointed, and I have been reduced to the necessity of remaining here or of leaving the department in a degree of confusion not wholesome to the present state of our Finances. I am sincerely sorry the Letters opened by General Scott from Mr. Banks to Mr. Hunter should have occasioned so much uneasiness in Vir- ginia. The inclosed publications will no doubt remove any suspicion as to the General, and I am persuaded Mr. Banks' conduct in his commer- cial views will also stand irreprehensible. We have encountered the greatest of difficulties in procuring contracts for the subsistance of the Arm}r here, amongst the inhabitants of the country the bands of Society had undergone too many fractures, and property too many revolutions, to leave us a resource in combined inter- ests for the business. The mercantile characters were mostly Foreigners unacquinted, as well as unconected with the country, and consequently would not specu- late in such an undertaking on nice calculation. Every endeavour has been made to excite a Competition for the business, but in the course of three months an offer of no sort could be drawn from any but Mr. Banks, he has undertaken it at somewhat less than lid. sterling, equal to 17Jd. Pennsylvania Currency. This is very high, but other resort was left for the support of the army. The measures of Government for giveing us supplies had entirely failed, and for the last two months we have rarely received more than half rations, and frequently no meat for five or six days. For a few weeks after the enemy left this country the people remained in tolerable tranquility, tho' not as to the interior country, in a State of Society the principles of Whigg and Tory were so equally dessemina- ted amongst them that mutual hostilities, and in many instances mur- ders have left resentments which several Generations will be required to efface. But even that tranquality is now over. Several Parties of the banished characters have lately, through the upper parts of Geor- gia, penetrated into this State, and are now within 50 or 60 miles of this capital, plundering & burning the property of such characters as are odious to them, and some murders have been committed.

Deep swamps afford them the securest cover whenever danger approaches, and the only possible means of ever interrupting them is by Dogs. These animals both parties have in this country, trained as regularly for hunting of men as ever they were for beast. In short sir, this is, and must continue an unhappy country. The people are ideally restored to their political state, but that political Fabric wants the necessary foundation of a social & cordial Connection, besides being liable to constant depredations from incensed and desperate enemies. Our cavalry have been sent after those people, but I fear can answer but little purpose, from the reasons I have mentioned. I have the Honor to be your Excellencies most obedt. Servant."

Col: John Montgomery to the Hon: the Board of Commissioners Feb'y 22d for the Settlement of Western Accounts. "Gentlemen, As I am Sensible that many Reports prejudicial to my New character hath been spred by persons of an Evil disposition, and perhaps Holland their character not known, may of course make some impression on you; and as my accts. are now on the carpit. I take the liberty of address- ing this short narrative to 3^ou, the Contents Being an undeniable truth, I am in hopes will have the desired effect and disperse any suspitions you may have, originated by those Characters alluded to. In 1777, being ordered with my Company from Wholstons to the Kentucky Country for its defence, I remained there untill the year following, when Col: Clark arrived at the falls of the Ohio with a body of Troops on his way to the Illinois. I Joined him, and on the presumption of our being Suckcessfull, it was thought prudent to Establish a small Post at that place for the conveniencey of a communication between the Illi- nois and Kentuckey Countries, after which we set out on our intended enterprise, and met with all the suckcess we could wish for, principally owing to the secrecy of our movements, after remaining in that coun- try untill circumstances appearantly permited our Return, I came of with the volunteers, having Instructions from Col: now Genl.

I proceeded on my rout and arrived at Kaskaskia the 29th of May 1779. an Expedition being already planed, or rather a manouver to prevent the Enemy's taking the Field and Distressing the Frontiers, I was Ordered to conduct the Troops by water to St. Vincent on the Wabash, Genl: Clark crossing by Land to that post with a small escort, the appearance of a design of atacking the Enemy on the Lakes being kept up untill the aprebentions of all danger of their attempting any- thing Capital that Season Yanished, a Garrison was ordered to be left at St. Yincene. The body of the batalion marched back to the Missis- sippi to Garrison the Towns Kaskaskia and Kohas. Genl: Clark find- ing the Public interest required that he should reside at the Falls of the Ohio untill provision should be made for the Insueing Campaign, I was ordered to take command of the Troops in the Illinois; make often reports of the State of the Department to Genl: Clark, and to be care- full to have Expences of government as moderate as possible: drawing bills of Exchange on him or the Treasury of Virginia for the payment of the Expences of the Troops, studying the general Interest of the State and Tranquility of the Inhabitants of the Different posts leting all kind of opressions be the last shift, this is the Substance of orders I received. I set out for Kaskaskia the 14th of August, and disposed of my Troops according to order, drawing Bills on the Treasurer for the suport of the Troops, after some time the Inhabitants refused to Take Bills drawn any other way than on Mr. Pollock of New Orleans or the Treasurer addressed to both which I was necessitated to do or suffer my Troops to perish, not dareing, from the nature of my Instructions to Impress provisions, if to be got by any other mains on moderate Terms. What might have been Genl: Clark's views for giving Such orders..I can't acct. for any other way than that of his views of future oppera- tions being such that he suposed it to be our Interest to keep the Inhabi- tants attached to us by Every means in our power, knowing the influ- ence they had over the- minds of a great number of Savage Tribes. My Troops suffered, as the credit of the State fell: no payment being made for the Bills that was Drawn, and never haveing any goods, or other property in my possession to have purchased provisions, which was gen- erally in Specie notes, which the vouchers to my accts. will best show. Bills I gave cash, for the recruiting Service was Depreciated, it required all the Industry we could possiable make use of to support ourselves, by hunting &c. in the Spring 1780, we were threatened with an Invasion.

I was Emediately convinced that some malicious person in my absence had made reports much to my prejudice asserting that I bad made large purchases pre- tendedly for the State and apropriated them to my use, which is a palp- able falsity, as it is wTell known that I never attempted any thing that could give the least suspicion of such practices, of course these reports have originated from false malitious persons so Common in the Western Country and so apt to be credited by persons that ought, and would despise them, could the know their charactar. You are sensible how fond some perticular classes of people are. of spreading reports prejudicial to others, a low character, in the Eastern part of the state, he fits himself out, come to the fronteers, supposes on his rout, that although of an Inferior Class in his own neighborhood will be at least Equal to the First in the Country he is a going to push himself into Company and perhaps Gets kicked out, and Emediately makes a point of Exclaiming, not only for sake of Eevenge, but is in hopes that strangers will view him as a man of consequence, but Sirs, you are too well acquainted with the world to make it necessary for me to say any thing more on the Subject of such Characters. I flatter myself that you will at least find, that too great credit have been paid to party reports, and that officers zealous in the interest of their Country, that have sacrifised their all for it, have suffered by those veiy men, who not having virtue enough to step forth in its Defence, have maid their fortunes under the banner of those offi- cers they wish to Destroy, no person but those that have been wit- nesses can have a just idea of the adress and Fatigues that it hath required to suport this Department that have Been the Salvation of all our fronteers, and saved much blood and Treasure, always Labouring under Every Kind of Difficualty, the want of men, money and provis- ion, and haveing not only to Counteract the designs of a Powerful sav- age Tribe, incouraged by British Emissaries and others Equally Dan- gerous to the State.

Prejudice & part}'' disputes, and the want of aids from Government hath in a great measure been the occasion of reducing this Department to a Defenceless State, at a time when we might suppose they were rising superior to the Enemy they have to contend with. How it hath been supported under these difficulties would require a pamphlett to convey to you the Idea of the measures that have been taken, rather than a Letter. Its present defence is what we ought to be solicitous for, for reasons obvious to every thinking man that is zealous for the welfare of this Country and will divest himself of prejudice, must know that great part of the State owe their protection to this Settlement, being far advanced towards the Enemy's Country, engaging the attention of those Savages that would (had they no such object) make frequent depredations on the Fronteers, and would have long since caused the richest part of our Country to have been abandoned, and instead of that assistance to the General defence, that have been given by the frontier Countries of the State, they would have required support from the more interior parts. What might not have been the consequence in such a situation; and what is that of this Country at present, detached from all immediate resource, surrounded by numerous Savage Tribes, inflamed from Educa- tion and the prospect of British reward.

State through inattention that will nearly double the Enemy, and the Feb'y 25th whole of the Savage Tribes let loose on a Country void of the necessary military stores to enable them to defend themselves, had they other 'W0 supplies. Emissaries among them dividing their Councills and destroying their Interest at the seat of Government, ready to take the advantage of the first opportunity to seperate them from the State they live in for the advantage of a few Individuals, who at present rejoice at every misfor- tune they meet with. Too few in number to harrass the Enemy, in the manner it ought to be done, and too great a number of women and children to make their escapes from the Country. We may expect nothing more certain than an Invasion the ensuing Fall if no measure should be taken to prevent it. Indian Tribes joining the Bloodjr League will counterbalance what they sufferred last year, and finding us to be too weak to keep up those Garrisons we have occupied &c; those cir- cumstances with a little British Flattery will induce them to make a Violent attempt, and perhaps agreable to the Genl: Council of the nations last fall, will imbody, as they express it, from the rising to the setting of the Sun, and finally drive the Kentuckians across the mountains and then the other Inhabitants into the Sea. In short, I think the settle- ment in extreme Danger, and that the interest of the Continent require that it should be immediately put in a state of defence, which is by no means in our power without assistance from the Executive. I have repeatedly wrote to them on this disagreable subject, without as yet receiving an answer, & therefore think it highly necessary that an Express should be sent immediately to Government, laying a state of the Department before them, in which I hope for your assistance. Lmake no doubt of it, from the Idea I have of your disposition, as it will farther convince them of the propriety of their taking some imme- diate steps for its support, by advancing monej^, Troops & Stores; at least such part as cannot be procured in this country. Fort Nelson ought by all means to be supported, as in the eyes of the Enemy, it is a key to the country, and immediately between the Body of the Enemy and the settlement. A garrison or two higher up the Eiver might be necessary as a Barrier to the Eastern parts of the Settlement, one hun- dred Regulars in each, reinforced occasionally by militia, which would be much cheaper than Garrisons of militia relieved every two months, and exceedingly burthensome to the Inhabitants. This is the smallest scale that I could possibly suppose would answer the purpose; and not then, except our army should penetrate to the head of the Oubache some time the ensuing summer, as the greatest body of the Enemy live there, those on the Miami retiring since the last expedition, by defeat- ing them, it is more than probable they would come to any terms with you before they would suffer their crops to be destroyed, which always 57

The greatest part of the hostile Tribes at present are of those people that have been in alliance with us until lately. An Expedition into their country would be appropo to what they ought to expect from us from the nature of the different Treaties held between us. Such an armiment to set out in July would prevent any capital designs they may have on this settlement, as that is about the time they generally take the Field when they move in large Bodies: their whole attention would be taken up by the Idea of defeating said Army as the preservation of their Families would depend on it. If they were disappointed you might be sure of any reasonable Terms. I could not suppose that such an under- taking would be difficult or expensive. 170,000 lbs Flour to be imme- diately purchased at Pittsburg and sent to Fort Nelson, and some other necessary stores. Kentucky might furnish 1,000 Troops, 500 to be drawn from other Quarters which would compose a sufficient Army, and probably in two month do the business proposed: at least they would convince the Indians that they were inferior to us, that the British assertions of our weakness was false, and that we could at all times pene- trate into their country at pleasure and destroy that Idea they have of their ability of routing the Kentucky country or prevent its population, and might induce them to suppose that their own Existance depended on their Amitty with us. take a slight view of the undeniable advantages the settlement is of, to the States at large, we then might with pro- priety suppose that there ought to be at least 350 Regular Troops kept up in this Department, one third at St. Vincents, well supplied with necessary supplies, and a sufficiency to furnish any little army that miirht be drawn into the field, which under these circumstances miffht be raised at any time, & penetrate into any quarter of the Enemy's Country at pleasure.

CALENDAK OF STATE PAPERS. 453 with them. The several letters I hope you have received this winter, 1783. will give you an Idea of the situation of Affairs in this Quarter at that March 8th time, but much more alarming at present, as the Ouabache Indians have at last generally Declared War, and I doubt, the Combination of Savages which the last Expedition was intended to have confused, still subsists: and if the destruction of the Shawnee property and the appearance of such a force in their County at a time when they supposed we were too weakened to attempt any thing, do not discourage them, I am affraid the Western Part of this settlement will be tore to pieces the insuing fall without the greatest attention & without something should be done by Government to prevent it. The Illinois will be Garrisoned by the English in a short time, as they have now little to fear, Since getting the whole of the Ouabache Indians engaged against us. we should have to cut our way through them before we could get at such Garrison. I have but little confidence in British promises of putting a stop to the savages continuing the War: its dangerous to their Interest, and their conduct among the Western Indians fully point out their Views. Sup- posing them sincere, the late expedition would be attended with the most salutary Consequences in showing the Indians what they might continue to expect, and they would of course with greater Ease comply with the British request; for they do not view themselves as dependant on the English, for them and ourselves have formerly taught them to think so much of themselves, that they would strike both if they were equally affronted. In my last letter I flattered you with the prospect of our attempting one of the Forts on the Ohio immediately. I was too sanguine in my hopes without Funds from you for the purchase of Provisions. Enough could not be provided to march a sufficient Body of men to the spot: Corn is the only article of Provision that could be got in tolerable plenty, a Bushel of which could not be got on the Credit of the State. I can't certainly conceive what reason your Excellency could have for supposing that 1 should be backward in having your Orders respecting those Forts executed, if in my Power one of them in particular would add greatly to my interest, and supposing me to be fond of Command, I then of course should prefer the greatest number possible. I thank }-ou Sir, for your permit for retiring, the smallness of the command could not have been my reasons, as it is certainly extensive, but quite a different cause. Every Exertion in my power have been made for many years for the Defence of this Department. Knowing the safety of all our Fronteers depended on it, of course took pleasure in encountering the greatest fatigues, leaving nothing in my Power undone, either by dividing the councils of the Indians, taking necessary steps to keep great numbers in our Interest, making necessary Excur- sions into their country to Distress our Enemy, and cause the Friendly to keep so. and attempting to destroy the Interest of that numerous Clan of Partizans or pretended Proprietors residing in Philadelphia that

As soon as I found they were likely to carry their point I at once saw the destruction of the country if the war should continue: and of course wished not to be a witness to the great success in their attempts against me, as the greatest stroke they could possibly make, put it out of my power to save the Country. I wished to be clear. These were my reasons. You mention that you wish a stop to be put any further drafts on New Orleans, it has long been the case. I don't know of a Bill of any kind being drawn for two years. I have continued to reduce the officers, as the number of soldiers decreased, since I was first acquainted with the act for that purpose. By this conveyance I expect you will receive a full account of the situation of the Country from the Board of Commissioners, as they have received every information in my power to give them. It is truly alarming. You will find by the last returns the great scarcity of Lead. If you will send an order to the mines for 1000 or 1500 lbs., previous to my arrival at that place.

These would be found important, tho' not decisive: and his Excel- ries for Peace leney might form his own opinion as to the prospects of a speedy Peace, slp1fter(jsat and act accordingly. The preliminary Articles of Peace, had been signed by Mr. Ozwald, Minister Plen: of G. Brittain, & Messrs. Adams, Franklin & Jay, our Ministers, provisionally; that is, to be effective when the definitive Treaty shall be concluded between France & G. Brittain. They are substantial^ as follows—ample recognition of the Inde- pendence of the United States, with relinquishment on the part of the Crown of all jurisdiction, sovereignty and property, &c, within the limits of the same. These are fixed as follows, from the mouth of the Bounds of the River St. Croix to the source, thence along those mountains which divide Umtedgtates the waters that fall on each side into the St. Lawrence & Atlantic ocean, thence to the head of Connecticut River, thence down the middle of that River to the 45th degree of Latitude, thence west to the River Iro- quois or Cataroquy, thence along the middle of said River to the Lake Ontario, thence thro' the middle of that Lake & the Lakes Erie, Huron, Superior & the lake of the Woods, pursuing the middle of their water communications, thence due west to the Mississippi, thence along the middle of that River to the 31st Degree of north latitude & thence from that intersection nearly an East course to the source of St. Mary's River, thence down the middle of that River to the Atlantic ocean, together with all Islands in s'd ocean within 20 Leagues of the Continent.

All Posts taken since the signing of these Preliminaries to be imme- March 12th diately relinquished—general amnesty on both sides for all offences, and a ceasing of all prosecutions growing out of such offences, &c. This was the general ground on which the agreement reciprocally signed, rested. Difficulties™ On the 24th Dr. Franklin writes, that difficulties had arisen, in the tio^olTacc't Prosecution of the negotiations between France & Great Britain. From of Gibralter the Journal of these negotiations, and the letters of the American min- isters, the chief difficulty seemed to be in relation to Gibraltar. France had offered to give G. Britain the Island of Guadaloupe for that Post, & to receive in return from Spain, the half of St. Domingo, which belongs now to Spain, but Britain obstinately contended for Porto Eico. To give some idea of the character of the information received by Congress, the following quotations from a letter from the Compte de Vergennes to Dr. Franklin, of the 24th ult: and transmitted by him, will describe the state of affairs at that date, " Our negotiations (i. e. between France & G. B.) are at the same point with yours: but yet far from an end" then again "Our facility has occasioned difficulty, again, "I do not despair: 1 rather hope, yet every thing is uncertain." On the whole their impression is, that the terms between France & G. Britain are agreed upon, tho' not signed—but Spain & Holland had made little progress in their business. His Excellency might be sure any further advices upon this important subject should be promptly transmitted to him by a safe hand. They herewith transmit a copy of Commission of his Swedish Majesty, authorizing his Minister at Paris to conclude a treaty with the U. States, the terms of which are very honorable and flattering.

Mr. Adams' house, tho' near, was too far from the Prison, to prevent Escapes and preserve order, but his present residence put it totally out ^of the power of the Jailor to prevent former or support the latter.

The Present Prison "being surrounded by tippling houses, liquor is conveyed to them by the guards, by disorderly people plying round the Pickets."

This could never happen if he lived upon the spot. The Justices of Henrico Co. at their last Court had given the old Jail to the Public; the bricks to be used as underpinning and for chimnies to the House to be built for the Keeper where the old Prison now stands; also the timber and plank.

As I expect this will have a speedy conveyance to you, I hope you will loose no Time after ye Reception of it to have the orders put in Execution.

But I have not the 1783. least Idea of their Quitting the war until they are Envited to A treaty April 30th by the prospect of presents, or Eeduced to a peace by an armament in their own country. They are, or will be convinced that a peace will take place and will push the war by small partyes with great Vigour, supposing that the greater number of prisoners they got, or the more formidable they make themselves to apear to us, the greater price they will get for peace, making no doubt of it whenever they choose to offer it, suposing that we are under obligations to them for it. This is the Idea that I could wish to be destroy'd. that they should be obligated to treat with us on our own terms, and convinced that they were Infe- riour to us, and that the}7 are under obligations to us for the Very lands they live on. An Army of 1500 men would be necessary to do this. I beleive easily to be got, but how they are to be furnish'd, it is impossi- ble for me to tell not knowing the Resources of Government. But as I hope to have the pleasure of waiting on your Excellency in a few days. I shall Endeavour in the mean time to Inable myself to sketch out some plan the most agreeable to my Ideas of the General Interest of the State. Inclos'd is copies of Instructions &c, which I hope your Excel- lency will aprove of. I could not think of any plan so likely to have the lead convey'd to Kentucky as the one I have fallen on. I am in hopes that the orders you. have sent for the different Taxes to be deliv- er'd will Inable us to garrisou the mouth of Kantucky in time, Except the collectors should be negligent in their duty. I could have heartily wished to have been at the treaty with the Chicasaws, but am convinced it will not take place until the fall or latter part of the Summer, as it will be a considerable time before Mr. Reed gets to that nation. I met him on his Rout to Kan lucky and Eecommended it to him to go by water from the falls as the most Expeditious and Safe Eout he could take, and if it was agreeable to the Indians, to have the Treaty at that place. My principal Reasons for such Recommendations was the great scarcity of provisions at the French Lick. The Indians continue to make Incursions into the different Countys in Kantucky and have Eepeatedly suffer'd the loss of some of their men. In answer to your Letter of the 29th of Novemb'r 1782, which lately came to hand, I can only say that Major Landot was Employed by me in the Spring of '79 as an Indian Agent for the upper Mississippi. That he rendered singular services in that department, and was permitted to go to Government, where he was Commissioned as Agent, and I beleive was very serviceable until his death, previous to his latter appointment I Generally Judg'd of the propriety of his Expences. and paid them myself and charged them to the State, which was the case with all the Agents in the Western Departm't, several of them being necessaries.

A few days afterwards a man was killed on Blue Stone by a Small Party, who were also pursued to no purpose. In consequence of Troops sent these alarms, he had sent out two companies to the defence of the out frontier, and the minds of the people were much quieted thereby. Proper measures had been taken to furnish supplies to these troops, by purchase, and contributions from those who had no money; he had given fifty pounds himself, & people of property were willing to subscribe and wait until government should pay them.

Martin, should be replaced, not a single am"Jlu"^lon pound had ever been received. frontier &c. In addition to this, out of 1000 lbs. of Lead ordered by the Executive to be delivered, only 300 lbs. had ever been received from Col: Lynch. To this fact was due the want of ammunition in the late alarms.

May 22d J "Sir, Richmond Agreeable to your Excellencies' Instructions, I lay before you the plan of such offensive measures as I should suppose the general Interest Required to be put in Execution this season against the Indians. It is notorious that those Tribes that have been for the greatest length of time acquainted with us firmly beleive that they can make war or peace with us at pleasure, and that we would at all times gladly embrace the offer of any terms with them. They have Abundant Reasons to believe it, if they Judge from our former conduct, as a treaty was always attended with considerable presents from us, which caused them to beleive we were afraid of them. In short, every Kind of lenity shewn them by us, is Imputed to Timidit}^, and until this Idea is destroy'd, a war will be the consequence of the least suppos'd affront they receive from us, which periods the young warriours will often wish for, and promote, in order to have an opportunity to show their valour, to which they are also Excited by the prospect of gain, as well by plunder as that of presents at the End of the war, confidently assured of peace when Ever they shall offer it. Tbis Idea, I presume, hath not yet gain'd much ground on the Oubash and the nations west of that River, as by some lucky strokes and the smiles of fortune, the Effections of near four thousand of their warriors, were weaned from the brittish Interest in the fall of Seventy Eight. Having the management of them myself thro' the means of Agents, I Endeavour'd to Instill such notions into them as will yet be of advantage to us in future treaties, altho' they have lately made war on us, owing to the Inabillity of our merchants to supply them with goods, and the distresses of the State being such, that they could not give any assistance. Those circumstances gave the brittish Emisaries Every advantage in Engaging them again to Receive their bloody belts. And I make no doubt but their correspondence with the Shawanees, Wiandots and others, will Enduce the whole of them to Embrace those Ideas I have before mentioned. They have no notion of being dependant on either the Brittish or Americans, But would make war on both if Equally Insulted. They conceive the English to be gratly Indebted to them for assistance given them during the war, and I suppose are by this time pretty well convinced that a peace will take place, and I am confident they will prosecute the war with as great violence as possible in order to make themselves more formidable to us. That the terms of the treaty may be more to their advantage, w7hich might be brought about in a very short time by send- ing a General Envitation to them. It is what they will Expect, and generally attend to. Influenced by the hopes of Receiving presents, Rather than a desire of being friendly with us.

A peace between us and brittain, may not have the Impres- sion on them as is generally suppos'd, of eonve.ying to them such an Idea of our Importance as to cause them to fear us. I make no doubt but the English Emisaries Explain the case in its most favourable light on their side, and cause us to apear as Insignificant in the Eyes of the Indians as possible. A greater opportunity can never offer to Reduce them to obedience than the present moment, as they are generally at war (I allude to those north of the Ohio), and nothing we could do to them would destroy our faith among other tribes. On the contrary have a valuable Impression on them, as we have every Excuse. If Eeducing them to obedience should be Eesolv'd on, I should Eecommend the following plan: To march an army of at least two thousand men Immediately into the heart of their country. If the}r Imbodied and fought you, a defeat would Ensure the terms you wish for. But I am confident they would generally sollicit to treat, when it would be in your power to convince them of what you were determined to do, giving them their own choice, either to come to your terms or continue the war. There would be no doubt of your wishes being compleated: they would be at once convinc'd that their non-compliance would be the destruction of their families. Judging from your uncommon and appa- rently determined conduct, your speeches to them could not be too daring, but it might be advisable to have the terms Easy, and let them know, that if they broke a single article, that you would make war on the nation that did it. Such conduct would soon put a final End to thoughts of a war Existing among them. At the Same time Justice Eequires that we should not infringe on the Treaty ourselves. From their disposition, I have found that nothing will so firmly bind them to us, as the fear of our arms, and the dread of loosing their Country. Which would be the greatest security we could possibly have for their good conduct, by obliging them to give up part of their country to pay us for the Expence of the war, which might lay waste until government chose to have it dispos'd of, and Informing them that whenever they acted contrary to a single article of the treaty, that you would make war on them, and take as much of their lands as would pay the Expence. Should your Excellency order such an armament, I conceive the most Easy and cheap plan would be to have the Eendezvous at the Kentucky. The People of that Country would rejoice at the prospect of an advan- tageous peace with the Indians, and most chearfully furnish near half the number of men. Militia might easily be marched from Holston, New Eiver and other parts of the frontiers, without any great Expence, and 1 should suppose ought to be equally interested with the Kantuck- ians, as they have undoubtedly, been cover'd from the depredations of 62

Perhaps it might be thought advisable for May 22d some assistance to be given from the frontier in the neighborhood of pittsburg, thro' the channel of the Ohio. But your Excellency will be the best Judge, in what manner such force could be collected with the greatest Ease to the falls of Ohio, which is undoubtedly the most central and advantageous post that is now possessed by the Americans, for the management of the Indian department in general. To Equip such an army as here propos'd, with all those necessary supplies that would Enable them to do the greatest service possible, would require a sum of money, which I doubt from the present stale of affairs could not possibly be furnish'd. And of course suppose that the smallest scale that could be thought to answer the purpose, would be prefer'd. From my long Experience in Indian affairs, and the knowledge of the policy of those nations alluded to, I take it for granted that if the plan was Enter'd into and prosecuted with vigor, that it would be of but short duration, and that two or three months provisions might answer the purpose, the greatest part of which must be procured in the pittsburg country. The Expence of the small supply of Horses and provisions necessary to Enable such an armament to answer the desirable purposes, could not be very considerable, provided they got on their march by the latter part of this summer. I learn the Brittish posts on the lakes are to be garrisoned by continental Troops. If those Troops and the armament propos'd were to commence their Eout nearly at the same time, it might greatly promote the general Interest. A few troops of horse would be much wanting, as it is found by experience, that they are of singular service in the Indian Department. If there is any farther Information in my power to give your Excellency, that may Enable you to conduct your western frontier to greater advantage, I shall at all times do it with pleasure. I have the honor to be, Your Excellency's Devoted and very Humbl. Servt." May22d GrEO: EOGERS CLARKE TO THE GOVERNOR OF VIRGINIA. "Sir, Richmond "Enclosed is a farther answer to your last letter to me.

I have not Enlarg'd so much on several heads as I at first intended, as it bore so much the appearance of dic- tating to your Excellency, but I am in hopes that I have been suffi- ciently explicit.

Officers of the Line, appointed by the Governor, according to office Law, to receive the money collected, from the County Lieutenants', are now required to proceed against the latter, in case of failure to render prompt account of their entire receipts. Upon an official Certificate Suggestions being furnished the Solicitor by the Clerk of the Council, that any ^^e0 recruit? County Lieutenant had thus failed, he is required to demand and recover ing tax from the latter one "Eigth of the County's Tax." Col: Peachy, whose brother is Co. Lieut: of Eichmond Co., had made his Settlement with Mr. Jett, as required, but some small sums having been subsequently paid in, and not returned, he is thereby liable to be proceeded against. This would be unjust to Mr. Peachy, and be "fixing a kind of stigma" on his character extremely disagreable." Other Co. Lieuts. were in the same category. In view of this difficulty, the Solicitor suggests to his Excellency that he be at once furnished with a list of the County Lieu- tenants of the District officers appointed to adjust their accounts, places of residence, counties assigned them, recruiting officers &c, so that he may make direct application to those District officers, and hold them responsible, by Suit at Law for the prompt settlement of their affairs, instead of proceeding in the Co.

"Sir, The frequent applications from the Inhabitants of our frontier In Council Counties, for assistance to repel the invading Indians have induced the Executive to order militia from the adjacent counties, on that service, which tho' all that we have it in our Power to do is frequently found ineffectual. On conversing with General Clark on the subject, he is of opinion that they never can be kept quiet till subjected by a military force sent into their Country. I have ever thought as he does but have been deter'd from the measure by the distress'd situation of the State with respect to its finances. Tho' at the same Time, I have doubted whether the expence would be in the end so great as we now incur by having so many parties of militia for such of Time on duty. Gen: Clark has reduced his Thoughts on the subject to writing, which

A circumstance has lately happened which may show a defect in the militia Law, and will require a remedy. Sixteen men were ordered from a neighbouring County to guard the Jail and stores, and Ten out of that number have refused to obey the order, tho' I am clear in my own opin- ion, that a mode of punishment may be found in the general power given the Executive over the militia by the Constitution. Yet I think it would be advisable to make it more so, by a clause in the militia Law, which every man might read and understand. The natural defence of a free People is militia. It will therefore perhaps be found expedient to arm government with such Powers over them as to render them useful whenever there should be an occasion for their services. I am, with sentiments of great respect & Esteem, Sir, your most obedt. Servant." June 1st Col: Arthur Campbell to the Governor.

On our getting possession of Post St. Vincennes in 1778, and gaining three or four thousand warriors to the American Interest, all commerce between that country and Dutroyt immediately ceased—the Checasaws, part of the Cherokees and other Southern Indians warmly attached to the British Interest rendered it exceedingly difficult for the merch'ts to get supplies from the Mississippi, as numbers of them were cut on* on their passage up the Ohio by the Indians, who had been instructed by the English to block up that River if possible. Those circumstances caused every article at St. Vincent to raise at least to four or five prices. The garrison kept at that Post were obliged to receive its supplies from the Inhabitants of the Town, whom consisted of about three hun- dred militia, about one Fourth farmers that scarcely raised a sufficiency of provisions to supply the Inhabitants. The British on the Lakes, sensible of our growing Interest with the Savages, spared no pains to

Consequently vast numbers of Savages were constantly at that Post, councelling &c. as agents were kept in every quarter of their Settlements where we could venture them, and St. Yincent at one time, became the seat of Indian Affairs. And those Articles necessary for the solemnity of Treaties, support of troops, &c. was generally procured for the State by a few merchants (Lagrass, Boisou, Lanitot and others) whose zeal Induced them to advance their fortunes for the public Interest. Governor Hamilton, by his Enemies in the pittsburg Country being informed there was a great number of dis- affected Persons in that Quarter ready to join him, resolved to make a Descent on that place, with all the power he could raise. Genl: Carlton approved of his plan, but recommended it to him, first to drive the Eebels out of the Illinois Country, otherwise they might possibly step in and take possession of Deetroyt, as he would have to leave it in a defence- less situation, after puting the latter into execution he might regain the whole of the Indian Interest, and complete his force to enable him to execute his first Design (the attempt was daring) but the prudent meas- ures that Gentleman conducted himself by, enabled him to get posses- sion of St. Yincent without much difficulty, the Season being too far advanced he was obliged to take up his Winter Quarters at that place, and of course disperse his Indian forces untill the Spring. In the mean time got captured by a superiour force, which doubly revived our Inter- est in that Quarter, and extended our Influence nearly to the walls of Dutroyt, and the great concourse of people that consequently happen'd for many months, Troops, Indians &c. nearly caused a famine. The Inhabitants not being able to recover their former plenty, in 1781 were obliged to abandon the Post for the want of supplies, from which moment our Interest with the Indians Sunk as rapidly as we had gained it. and nearly the whole engaged in War against us.

They sent in a written demand to be allowed to appoint under-officers to redress their grievances, requiring a favourable answer in twenty minutes, or they would let in enraged Soldiery. This, altho' directed to the Executive Council was certainly meant ultimately for Congress, to whom a memorial had been previously presented signed by Sergeants, of so insolent a nature as to forbid any answer. In this situation Congress thought it most becoming their character to take no public notice of the insult, but to forbear any official act whatever. By the exertions of Genl: Sinclair and of individual members of Congress they were gradually diverted from their purpose, altho' inflamed by misrepresentation & intoxicated with liquor furnished by the rabble present. This scene continued about twelve to three o'clock when Con- gress retired thro' the soldiers—who themselves shortly after retired to their Barracks. At about 6 o'clock, Congress reassembled and resolved that the committee should again wait on the Executive & demand a cate- gorical answer, whether they could make exertions to support Govern- ment & to inform that unless satisfactory measures should be taken to restore the authority to Government, (of which the Committee and President were to be judges in the recess of Congress) that then Congress should be summoned to meet at Prince Town or Trentown in New Jer- sey. Of these steps General Washington was informed & directed to detach a select force for the purpose of quelling the mutiny. The Com- mittee found the Executive wholly indicisive, & at their request, gave 'em a day to deliberate, at the end of which they remained either inca- pable or indisposed to exert the necessary force. In this state things now remain, the temper and views of the mutinears are not ascertained, as little are known the root or extent of the evil. 1783. July 4th Conduct of the muti- neers, &e. Genl.

Having forbid Jno. Berry- man and Charles Stuart from hunting on his land, Stith had urged Stuart and furnished him with pistols to challenge him (Thornton). Before this Stith had brought about a duel between Lawrence Washing- ton and Philip T.

For if Congress takes up the business of Easing us of the Burthen of our too extended Frontiers, and they have many plausa- ble reasons for so doing, and I think have as many plausable reasons for acquescence in that business, (for our frontier settlements has cost this State infinitely more than ever they can or will reimburse us & they will always continue a dead weight on us, it therefore is my wish we ware quit of them on good terms.

He set out on the 1st May, was detained Decern, for want of Guides, "the distance from there to the Chickasaws being 300 miles & no road, and dangerous traveling alone/' the way infested by the hostile Creeks, so that it was the 2nd August when he arrived at the Chickasaw towns. On the 23d August Reid had sent him word the Chickasaws had agreed to meet at the time and place suggested, and that an earlier day would not have suited them. This information he at once sent to Colos. Martin & Donclson, two hundred miles away. From these facts he trusts Major Reid will not longer be blamed for "procrastinating that Treaty to so late a period," &c. J. Madison, Robert Andrews and John Page, Commissioners to Decern. 2d Gov: Harrison. They had considered what Instruments would be necessary to them Williams- in fixing the Boundary Line between Yirg'a and Penn'a, and find there burS is such a scarcity of the proper kind in the State that an Appropriation Expenses of £135, would be necessary to get them by importation. The two lnci4entJ-0 J J & j r running the observatories to be built, one at each end of the Line would probably Boundary "cost one hundred pounds currency," and the expenses of travelling for y^^p^n*1 four Commissioners at £6.00 pr: day, for four or five months, the time necessary in which to finish the work, would amount to £800. To this estimate is to be added the allowance to the Commissioners for their ser- vices, "which we presume your Excellency & the hon'ble Council will estimate according to their extraordinary nature." They request an early reply to their suggestions, especially as regards the importation of Instruments, as they had agreed to begin their observations on the 1st June next.

They would be useful afterwards, or might bo given to "some of the Academies." As to the Time required to finish the business, he is of the opinion, "that the number of necessary Observations to be made on the Eclipses of Jupiter's Satellites alone, to ascertain with sufficient accuracy the difference of Longitude between the Eastern and Western 69

Although he had made purchases there, so far from being amenable to this charge, Col: Donelson "had neglected his own private business in order to serve the Public" and he assures his Excellency any report to the contrary was malicious and groundless. The Powell's Yalley Station was settling fast. He had furnished Mr. Reid out of the public store, linen, four Ruffeled shirts, &c, to be charged to his account.

The Creeks They had also found the Chickamaugas favorable to peace, but the hostile Creeks did not attend at the Council as expected—A small "town of the Delawares living on the Tennessee in the Chickasaw County had refused to treat, but the Eed King, declares he will drive them out or force them to terms. They had been informed by the King of the Chickasaws, Spanish that some Spanish Trades from their "Dominions on the Mississippi" Traders were establishing depots of goods on the Tennessee River near the mouth of Bear Creek, and were endeavouring by every means to gain the Indians to their favor, to the detriment of the United States—They suggest the propriety of immediate action to counter act this move.

The Attorney General, at great length, contends and decides against the justice of this demand—He assumes, that under the 4th article of the Confederation and the Laws of nations a citizen of one independent state cannot be carried into another to be tried, without previous investigation iuto the charges against him; that Hancock could not be proven to have been guilty of a "high misdemea- nor," and that therefore the demand was based upon an illegal and exag- gerated degree of crime. Under the existing law the Executive alone can secure the delivery of the accused should they differ from his opinion. To effect this a Justice of the Peace must be notified that the demand is properly made, and be ordered to cause his arrest. He does not think the rights of citizenship can authorize such proceedure. The demand

"1 approve the method you have taken to support your Troops—Their Feb'y 7th time of service being now expired by the happy conclusion of the War, you will please to discharge your whole corps."—Thus Brothers we prove to you our sincerity in desiring Peace and friendship: Our War- riors are discharged and gone home to their wives and children. We have buried the Tomahawk, we have covered the blood which has been spilt & we have gathered together the bones which were scattered on the Ground, and buried them in a large Grave, that they may no more be seen. Now Brothers, we wish you to do the same, to join your hands to ours, bury the Hatchet, and let war come no more among us, for we desire to become one flesh and one Blood with you. When the Peace which the Americans and British have made comes among you, you will find that the British have forgot you their children. Nevertheless, we wish to consider you as Brothers, and hold with you the Chain of Friendship. Mr. Owens informed me that the Talks I sent you some time ago on the Subject of a Treaty was not yet opened on'account of your Chiefs being absent: As soon as they have collected & considered of the matter, it will be necessary to send a Runner to let us know their sentiments, that I may inform our Great Chief, who will send Persons to meet them at this place, at any time they may appoint, to conclude a firm Peace, which we hope may continue as long as the Rivers & Woods shall last." To the Cheifs & Warriors of the Shawances Nation. Copy of Papers concerning the claim of Campbell & Simmcs to Lands Feb'y 10th in Pensylvania, formerly \y\ng in Virginia. J. Ambler, Treasurer, to the Governor. Feb;y llth -Sir, I had the honor to inform your Excellency about ten days ago, Treasury that every Shilling of money in the Treasury, which was not expressly Office tied up, was paid on account of the Delegates in Congress, on Mr. Jefferson's pressing requisition: We arc absolutely unable to furnish The Treasury money for the triffling contingent expenses of the public Offices, emPly such as fuel & stationary. It gives me real concern, that I cannot pos- sibly comply with the requisition in yoixv Excellency's letter of the 9lh, until the Treasury is by some means or other aided. I am with great respect, Your Excellency's Most obed't Serv't, &c, &c.

Order of Congress, recognising Sieur Ostcr, as "vice Consul of France AnnapoHs at Ricnmoncl in the State of Virginia" which state uis called upon by "Oster" virtue of the powers delegated by the Confederation to the United at'Richmond 8tates in Congress" to furnish the said Sieur Oster, their Executor, &c. Feb'y 16th Col: Jos: Martin to Gov: Harrison. "Sir, Henry Co. Your Exeelly's of the 14th Novembr. in Council, came to my hands sometime ago, & as I am just Come Home, and for many weeks past the - Weather rendered travelling almost impossible, I could not sooner Answer the Contents, & heavy as the Charges seem to be against my Conduct, I am Comforted by the Reflection, that I have not done Any thing, inconsistent with my Duty as a public agent." Vindicates "True it is, that I am one with others concerned in a Bargain with his conduct the cherokees for a Tract of Land on the Tenassee which will fall into in purchas- ing the Land South Carolina or Georgia, the latter I believe—It lays on the North on the Ten- g-(je Qf Rjver jn a ]arge Bent of it, near the muscle shoals—North nessee River ° 1 from the Carolina has opened her Land Office for the Territory on the Eastern & Cherokees \yestern Side of this Bent, * * * & the country is filling up with Inhabitants around it so fast, that the Indians plainly perceived the Condition of Ground we purchased would be of no Service to them. And it is a Fact thiU &cUnty' a^80' num^er °f People wn0 have actually gone & declared a resolution to go, and settle this very Ground in Question, was very con- siderable: & this Settlement was to be made, without any Agreement with the Indians. What was then to have been Apprehended, I leave to y'r Excellency's Judgement: more particularly when the Character & Dis- position of this Kind of our back Settlers, is considered: & that the minds of the Indians are much irritated by late repeated Encroach- ments. It has been no easy task to prevent them from speedy & signal vengeance for recent Injuries of this sort, nor to remove their appre- hensions of more in Future. In this state of Facts, it is easy to guess what would have been the Issue of our Treaty with them, if at the Time, the Settlements near the Shoals or Bent was going o# without their leave. The true What then could be done, more likely to conciliate the returning policy Affections of the Indians (especially the Chickamoggas who are nearest the place) than agreeing to pay them a reasonable price for the Land, which tho' not absolutely necessary for their subsistence, was their Property." He then admits, he had rec'd no orders as Agent, to take this step, but did it upon his own responsibility, and is willing to abide an enquiry; as he is unwilling to hold any land, "independent of the States, for whose establishment, he had never ceased to endeavour."

CALENDAB OF STATE PAPERS. 561 Proceeds—"It is not easy for those who are unacquainted with our 1784. Frontiers, to judge of the evils & calamities which threaten to arise Feb'y 16th from the licentious & ungovernable conduct of the People there. To Peculiarities reconcile this witTi the vindictive Spirit of the Indians is really difficult °\ife°&™r & often Times impossible—I Know of no way so proper to conciliate these People to our nation permanently, as to procure in the settlement about to be made, a number of respectable Gentlemen, who will serve as checks to the licentious & wicked—And I should not have made this Purchase, but with the concurranee & at the Request of a Number of the first Gentlemen in North Carolina, with whose sentiments I was made acquainted: & if final Success attend our Enterprise, I am certain Good effects that a settlement will be formed directly, as respectable for the charac- of chaseUr" ter as number of People: and while it helps to form a Barrier to the Eastern Inhabitants, seems to be most likely to discourage that anarchy, which is but two common, and to discover, if not prevent, certain Par- ties of the Spaniards, of which you will probably hear before long. I wish I could avoid speaking of my own particular advantages, and The necessity thereby avoid adding to your Excellency's Trouble: but the severity of Aof,referring J ° J J 7 J to bis private your Excellency's Reprehensions has made it necessary. No doubt I affairs have many Enemys, who wish to supplant me, & to this End are never ceasing to propagate their Falsehoods. The particular Time, and dis- tressing circumstances, in which I at first undertook this Agency, I sup- pose are well Known—Some who now want it, rather wonder at the Motives of Folly of one who ventured among the Indians during the War, than desired to take this Place, But now, the Tone is altered & they are brave enough to face the Danger. I wish they were honest enough to tell the truth. If I now seek my own advantage, it is consistent with the public Good—my Partners would disdain anything otherwise. I have never as yet added to the Embarrassments of my Country by claiming Dona- tions to myself, & by engaging in this Purchase in a distant State, I must have promoted the public Good." "I had no hand in slopping the Expedition against the Chickamoggas, The Expedi- as is universally Known: but am very ^lad it was stopped, for it is cer- tion against -r • -n , theChicka- tam those Indians are now m Peace with us, without attacking them: maugas & who can say how many Lives might have been lost, how great Expence of money, and the final Event, if Hostilitys had been pursued." * * * "As your Excellency's last to me, was written in Desires this Council, I request the Favor that this may be laid before that honorable j^before Board, for their Consideration. I also beg that if there remains any- the Council thing not yet cleared up, in my Conduct, that you may let me know it, that I may have an opportunity to do justice to my character. I will be very glad to know who are the Persons who alledge misconduct against me, as I think it but just to know my accusers, as I believe I can place them in a proper Light.

On the 12th Jan'y 1783, Col: Jos: Martin apprehending great danger from the different Tribes of Indians preparing to attack the settlements on the Holston, had engaged him in the Cherokee nation to deliver despatches Col: Martin to his Excellency. Before preparing these despatches Col: Martin had wUhSDe"- detained him at the Holston until the February following, in order to patches to have more talk with the Indians. The badness of the roads and the "swells in the rivers" prevented his arrival at Richmond until the 6th March, where he was detained, until the 12th, when he set out on the business of his Commission. At New London he was detained to see Col: Donelson, one of the Commissioners, to whom he delivered his Excelly's instructions, and from whom he ree'd orders to proceed to the Great Island on Holston for further instructions from Col: Martin, who detained him until April 14th for the purpose of securing a guard Richmond Causes of detention

Set out on his He being one of the Commissioners, and being directed to apply to him Kentucky to appoint the time and Place where the Chickasaws were to meet for the Treaty, he was detained there until the 2d of May—Proceeds—" 17th of May I arrived at the French Lick on Cumberland 240 miles from Shelby's. On my arrival I acquainted the Inhabitants of my appoint- ment. Colonel Eobertson, who commanded then, persuaded the inhabi- tants not to let me go on the business, and called a Committee, who determined against my gowing to the nation, but after ray pressing the necessity, they concluded to call a meeting of the people, who deter- mined that I might proceed on my journey—this with the difficulty of obtaining guides detained me until the 14th July. I should have pro- ceeded on ray journey, on ray first arrival at the Cumberland, but the frequent murders of the inhabitants, and its being from thence 300 miles to the nation, and my being unacquainted with the way (which was through the woods) obliged me to employ two people for Guides, and arrived at the nation 14 days after. On the first of August I had a conference with the chiefs, by a lincester (Linguester) who was a British officer, and they agreed that they would meet the Commission- ers, the full moon in October, at the French Lick, on Cumberland. On the 3d of August, I wrote Col: Shelby of my arrival, and success with the nation. About 12 days after, I engaged a lincester (Linguester) in the nation, that was well vers'd in their language (as there was none in the Cumberland settlement) to accompany the Indians to the place of Treaty, and on the 25th of August, after recovering a slight ilness, and my Horses being a little recruited, I set out for Cumberland settlement, and in 20 days I arrived at the place of Treaty—a few dajrs after I rec'd a letter from Col: Shelby expressing his doubts that the Commissioners would not attend, and thinking it not only to the interest of this Coun- try, but my duty to wait their arrival, & in case they should not attend, to invite them to the big Island on Holston, where two of the Commis- sioners were, I stayed until their arrival, what was the time they appointed. The Comm'rs did not meet until about 10 days after the Indians, and I was obliged to find the warriors every necessary until the arrival of our Comm'rs, who afterwards directed me to do this business, all for which I have been paid except what is charged. About the 12th of Nov: the Treaty was concluded, when I set out with the Commissioners from the Cumberland Settlement, and arrived ai the Block House on Holston, (the distance being about 480 miles) the 12th December. About the 20th I set out from Holston, on my way to this place, the badness of the weather, the ice (of which your Excellency can now form some judgement from what may be seen), &c, &c, cannot fail accounting for my not arriving from Holston at this place, before I did.

The Maryland people seem to think them- selves "priviledged to embezzle from wrecked vessels." They have a good opportunity of doing this as the Island of Assitiaque (famous for its shoals & on which three valuable Vessels have been lately stranded) lies near that state. They are furnished with information by the Island people, "who are concerned in such villany." An outrage of this kind had lately been committed by one Wm. Holland of Worcester Co. He therefore calls upon the Executive for redress against this man—"as well in behalf of the public, as the unfortunate Gentlemen who have been such loosers," &c. "Holland takes care not to come within the reach of any process from this State" else he would not trouble his Excell'y. April 10th S- Hardy (Delegate) to the Governor of Va.

CALENDAR OF STATE PAPERS. 573 John F. Mercer, (Delegate), to the Executive op Yirginia. 1784. April 10th "Gentlemen, Having heretofore wrote divers Letters to his Excellenc}T Annapolis Benjamin Harrison, but no reason existing that can induce me to sup- pose they have ever come to hand, I can but imagine that some wick- edly disposed Persons have intercepted all my correspondanee; a prac- Correspon- tice become but too common, by the relax'd morals of our people—to ^cept^d^" the great scandal of all government. I have therefore determined, in order to deceive those villians to open a new source of communication, Each dele- writes which I hope will continue during the month, in which it is my duty to 0fficjai inters write official Letters, unsuspected & of course safe." pr: Month Enclos'd is a .Report of a Grand Committee on the requisition for the current year, acted upon, altho' not yet pass'd. I could wish for informa- tion on the statement marked "A," which is an Apportionment of 1,200,000, to compleat the payment of Interest on Loan Office Certifi- cates. Has any Tax ever been laid by the state of Virginia for its pay- ment? If there has not been, I cou'd wish to oppose the idea alto- gether for 2 reasons: 1. The State must pay this sum in specie, as She has not among her Objections to citizens above 300,000 Dollars out of 11,000,000—& the Requisition on which this sum is calPd for is intended manifestly to enable the states est on to releive their own Citizens. We will not allow any Complaints from "^x^ebT1 them to reach Congress. 2ndly. the Circumstances of our Citizens will not permit our paying up all the arrears of interest at this moment. & certainly whoever con- siders the history of the loan office debt, will agree, that if ever they get paid, they will have brought their money to a good market." "I am also against the clause marked UB" for two reasons— 1. We are to pay ourselves first & every deficiency is to be borne by Foreign Creditors; which would be a breach of faith, and in fact, it is intended to make the Southern States pay all the Foreign Debt— 2ndl}\ It will give the Northern States great facility, who have settled all the Acc'ts of Individuals with the Continent, the Southern States have not, of course have no Conti'l Securities & they must in fact give more than their proportion in Taxes, being oblig'd to sell their property for Specie to pay their Taxes, when the others are allowed to sell for Certificates. A System for making Treaties in Europe is now before Congress & will possibly pass, the Delegation will I believe give their assent, if we are properly represented in the Commission.

There is an old Log-House, which has been for some Time appropriated to the use of the -Guard, within one hundred yards of the Prison, and now occupied by a few soldiers, which can be easily spared. I request your Excellency will be pleased to direct Col: Meriwether, or the officer of the Guard, to remove them to the Barracks on the Shockoe side of the Creek, which are sufficiently spacious to contain the whole Guard, and that this House be delivered up to me for a temjDorary kitchen.

I am happy to learn that my proceedings, with respect to the Sowers of Sedition met with Your Excellency's approbation: & still more so that I now have it in my power to inform You, that Pomeroy himself, the first mover, at least the ostensible cause of the Disturbance, has undergone the same fate with that of his partizans. A few weeks ago, I was informed that he had returned from Congress & had circu- lated Letters among his adherents calculated to Keep up their spirits & expectations: that matters were not yet ripe for execution, &c, &c.

There was a very crowded Audience during the whole Trial 3-5th of which I am persuaded were of the number of his Followers, notwithstanding which, the most perfect Decorum was observed throughout. Together with the Evidence made use of, in behalf of the Commonwealth, I called on five or six of the Eingleaders of the party, as I could easily pick them out of the Crowd, most of whom swore to the very facts, which the State Witnesses declared. He was fined 2,000 lbs. of Tobacco, the extent of the Law, and bound to the Behaviour, with two Sureties, himself in £1000, & his Sureties in £500 each. I was surprised to see with what chearfulness his party offered to be his Security. Instead of Indignation & Eesentment. at being brought into contempt & ridicule, by his falsehoods & misrepresentations, they seemed to mourn at his con- viction. I was for a considerable time almost at a loss to know under what Law he should be punished. To prosecute him for high crimes & misdemeanors, was unprecedented not only in this new country, but in the State: it would have been difficult to have fixed the matter, & to have brought him under the description: his crime did not amount to Treason, tho' the consequences were nearly as serious and alarming:

Commonwealth, but less than Treason had expired by the ratification May 21st of the Articles of the Definitive Treaty of peace. I therefore had recourse to our old Law, almost absolute, for the punishment of Divul- gers of false news; and endeavoured to draw a parallel between our * present situation & that of our Forefathers at the time of the Restora- tion when this Act passed. I now persuade myself & hope with your Excellency that we Shall be no longer troubjed with this turbulent and Hopes for factious set of men. There is Yet a certain Leitch, who was considered Leitch"&c. as second to Pomeroy & was commissioned jointly with him to Congress, who has not yet returned, whom I mean to prosecute: & then, unless new Disorders arise, which I by no means apprehend, I shall conceive public Justice may rest satisfied, as the other members of the party arc two inconsiderable to dread any Danger from. While I am on the subject of Dissentions in this Country, permit me Indians A.ffairs to mention to Your Excellency the state of Indian affairs & the preca- rious situation of the Western Inhabitants in consequence of the arrange- ments that have been taken relative thereto. As early as June last, when the Oubache & Sanduskie Tribes first understood that a general peace was about to take place, between Great Britain & America, Depu- tations from most of them came to the Falls of Ohio, desiring to know what Line of Conduct we meant to pursue towards them & at the same time expressing an earnest desire to brighten up the chain of Friend- Disposed to ship, which British artifice & Seduction had caused to rust, observing Peace that the mist was now cleared before their Ej^es, that they could see clears &c, &c. I happened at Louisville both then & at sundry other times when their Cheifs & Runners came about this Business: and as I was always invited to the Council, I endeavoured to impress upon them the necessity there was of their giving some proof of the sincerity: that Guarantees they now had an opportunity to do this, by giving up, without ransom req^^ of the horses & prisoners they had among them: and that unless they did this, as it was a matter wholly in their power, Doubts might arise with our Great Men below, concerning the reality of their professions. At first, I never saw men seemingly more determined to comply with whatever was required of them: they readily promised to do all that Their was asked, and a man was accordingly sent to Post Yincennes to receive Duplicity the prisoners & Horses. But after waiting there a considerable time and receiving nothing, as has transpired, but frivolous excuses, he returned. The Indians in the mean time & ever since, still keep up the appearance of being anxious to be in Friendship with us. We at different times informed them of our Expectations about a General Treaty, without which they can do nothing, & they communi- cated their Ideas to-us. As Soon as it was made known that Congress They are had taken up the Subject, we directed them to look up to that Body referred to Concrress the Bostonians (?) & not to us, the Big Knife, for peace & Trade. They had previous, and indeed after this intelligence came to hand, been wrote 74

A disappointment however, after such advertisement was sure to operate to our prejudice. Their s expectations were raised very high upon this Information & Chiefs as well as Runners frequently came over to us, advising us of every thing they heard & explaining their conduct when any Scalps were taken. Still trouble- As nations, they abstained from Acts of violence & Robbery, tho' Small some parties from Several Tribes would still be doing mischief, both in steal- ing Horses, taking prisoners & even murdering the Inhabitants. All this was borne by our people with great patience; who Still hoped that the General Treaty would put a final End to these Disorders. The TheChica- Chickamoggies, a large Separated Tribe of the Cherokees, were all this maugas hos- ^me actjng with every mark of an enraged Enemy, & rendered it dangerous to pass from one outside Station, to another. A Body of Volunteers were collecting to check their Incursions, but were prevailed upon to give over their plan, by one of the Commissioners, who hap- dened here at the time, as the Tribe had given certain assurances of making peace & that he expected it was signed by that time. A regard The people's to publick Faith, prevailed over the Resentments of the People. But forbearance wuen Q.Gn\.

The active mind of man cannot bear to be unemplo37ed & immediately is casting about to remove the causes of their present con- finement; hence these political parties & factions & hence so ready an Ear to listen to Tales from the Designing in the Northern States. Another source of complaint, which is confined indeed mostly to the Serious want better sort of people, arises from the want of energy in Government, °.f dueaclmin- 1 1' rtJ 'istration of from a Defect of Distributive Justice among us. 'Justice The Fund appropriated for the maintenance of the Supreme Court in Failure of this District has proved wholly inadequate to the End; So much that Cmir^appre- the Judges have not received £10, apiece for their Services: their attend- bended & the ance cannot be*expected unless other Funds are granted them. If the .quencos present gentlemen resign, which I am informed they have in comtem- thereof plation unless their Salaries are secured to them, by the adoption of some other mode than the present, I am greatly at a loss to Know where others could be got to supply their places. Unless men of abilities & Integrity fill so high an office, it were bet- ter for the people to annihilate the Tribunal & leave them as they were. Few men of capacity here will for some years be willing to undertake the offices, because other Employments offer, which afford more lucrative prospects: Something therefore should be clone to induce the present members to continue. If a Dissolution of the Court takes place, anarchy & confusion must follow, because faction & error will bring the County Court into Contempt: their authority will immediately be trampled on & disregard—Exclusive of other Differences, pomp & sound have a great influence over minds of nine tenths of mankind—In a Frontier too, so The peculiar- remote as ours, to which the Knave & the outlaw from every State in Uies °.f th® J .Frontier & the Union fly as to an Asylum, a place of Impurity, the Springs of Gov- necessity of eminent cannot be too tightly wound up: the punishment should tread , executinS 1 law promptly close on the heels of the crime: As a state of Idleness & Inactivity has been the parent of Sedition, So a relaxation in the Execution of the penal Laws of the State will beget and unwillingness to obey any Law at all.

Give me leave sir to add a few words, which may throw some light on this new Method Pennsylvania has adopted to carry the Agreement into Execution. I am told by one of their Council, The Executive of Penn'a has wrote to your Hon'r Council for an exact list of Entrys made under Yirginia, previous to the Agreement Enter'd into at Balti- more the 31st day of August 1779. 2ndly. That £3.10.0 shall be paid by all those People for surveying their Lands & 3dly. That the sum of £10.0.0. p'r hundred acres shall be paid for all Lands not so entered, with legal interest from the date of Settlement! As to the 1st, I mean the List! What a farr fraught thought is this! It's well known many of the poor People in this Country have been deterred entering their Lands with the Comm'rs. Others have entered with the Com'rs, and by Penn- sylvania issuing a Proclamation forbidding our Comm'rs acting within these bounds, have stopt'd half way, e. i. Entered with the Comm'rs, but never entered with the Surveyor. Others I find have entered with both Com'r & Surveyor, who by neglect omitted to certify to these entrys. Shall these men pay ten pounds pr: hundred with Interest,? If so, it's cruel and hard! The list I now send I presume is to go from you to the Executive of Pennsylvania—by this List I judge the People are to be disseminated: Good God, what can those men hope for, who are deem'd Yirginians! What does their own People say on, or about the late Act!" * * * * * * * This List contains an Acc't of the Quantity of Land granted, the place where situate, and the Time of Entry with the Surveyor.

That after the arrival of the Difinitive Treaty, he left of Loyalists New York for yirginiau After roadjng the "Citizens' Bill passed by the last Assembly" he conceived himself at liberty to settle in this State and become a Citizen. He considered himself amenable to the Laws & therefore entitled to their protection. His surprise was great there- fore when on the day previous, he found himself called upon by a num- ber of men, who, after many questions which he answered candidly, informed him, they'had formed themselves into a Committee, and "had come to some Resolutions'' which they read to him:—afterwards a note, full of threats was delivered to him. His situation may be judged of, when they arS informed that upon so short a notice he is required to settle up his affairs, and remove his family from the State. He there- fore hopes the Gov: & Council will take measures to prevent his being driven out of .the state, at least, until the "time limited by the Treaty of Peace is expired."

I am sorry you did not send Sooner, as they were all set off to Pensacola ^ pensacola before I received your Letter, or I would have sent them back, and all they had.

Many horses have been stolen from the Indians, and brought to the settlements: and many have been taken from the settle- ments to Chickarnogge, and from thence to Pensacola and Augustine. I have used the best Exertions I could, to prevent those Disorders, and have detected some of the offenders among the White People, who I am to appear against in August. There appears to be great Disorder among the Indians at present: Several Hundred are gone to a Treaty The Indians with the Spaniards on some part of the Mississippi. They went off in Spaniards Canoes, and are to take Part of those at the Muscle Shoals with them. The Treat}T with the Creeks is over, & they have returned with large Presents.

"Sir, My fears that the Incursions of the Savages might be shortly attended with unhappy consequences have eventually proved unfortu- nately too true. This Western County, perhaps Sir, has never sustained a greater Loss, or more deep felt shock, in the Death of one man, than it now does in that of Walker Daniel Esquire who with a merchant from Ireland by the name of George Keightley, on the 12th ulto: were Killed and Scalped by the Savages. As I was in Company & had nearly have shared the Same unhappy Fate: (a Ball having glanced my Breast) a concise Eelation, perhaps may not be amiss.

Within five or six miles of the Salt Works, we were fired on by several Savages, to the number of Six, as near as my fears, and the momentary Glance I had of them could per- mit me to distinguish. The sudden and unexpected sight of a Savage stepping from behind a Tree, and deliberately firing on us, occasioned an Exclamation of there!! from me, who first discovered him, but the word had hardly escaped my Lips, before two or three guns more were fired on us, and the war whoop raised, the unfortunate gentlemen fell dead on the spot, having rec'd the fatal Ball thro' their Hearts—the wound I rec'd was not attended with dangerous Consequences—the same Evening the dead Gent: were taken to a house half a mile farther on the Eoad, and the day afterwards conveyed to the Salt Works for a Burial. The Savages, according to custom, were in vain pursued—And we are now under momentary painful anxiety—We See daily signs of their Incursions—they travel our Countrj7 fearless of Danger, while in trembling Crowds, the men, women & children once more leave their little Farms, and unless some eventual and Speedy steps are taken to revenge the Insult, we shall continually be subject to the cruelties of a Savage Enemy—We cannot now do anything—provisions never were scarcer here, than at present.

I hope your Excellency & the Board will be assured enthThtaerd-11 that bad the ^atlire of our Business required a farther Risk of Health ships, &c, if & longer Sacrifice of Interest & Domestic Happiness, that few Citizens necessary, can ^e founci WDo would with more Readiness have run that Risk & ana compli-' ments his continued that sacrifice than I should. Permit me Sir, to recommend to associate y0ur particular Attention my worthy Associate in the arduous Work, in which we have been engaged: his zeal for the Interest of this State & Perseverance in its Service I humbly think may justly claim it. I find Observatory by a Letter from him dated at Wilmington (the place of our Observatory) Much in Sept: ye 20tb, that he had received neither Remittance nor Letters on vvant^of that, Subject, & that therefore he was under the necessity of endeavour- ing to negociate the Bill, which we had jointly drawn on the Treasurer when I left Wilmington on ye 13th. This step was absolutely necessary, as my Proportion of the £800, which had been advanced the Commis- sioners was expended, & Mr. Andrew's nearly so—& we had waited many Weeks, for an answer from your Excellency to our Letter apply- ing for a further Advance to enable us to finish the Business & return home. Mr. Andrews was to keep the Bill 'till after the Post of the 19tb, when if he should receive any Remittance, he was to cancel it, if not, he was to endeavour to negociate it. In full confidence that he would receive a Remittance or Directions to draw on the Treasurer, I was induced to refer my Landlord to Mr. Andrews for Payment of a Bal'ce due to him for my board, & had I not, on my way to Baltimore, met a Met a private Remittance from my Steward, I should have been under further Remittance Embarrassments before I could have reached Home. It gives me pain to mention it Sir, but unless Mr. Andrews should receive a Remittance, or can sell our Bill he must be greatly distressed & can not go to the

By Post Script, he expresses the hope, his Excellency & the Board will not construe his letter into a complaint, of being neglected, or of having been furnished with a too scanty allowance for their expences, but rather that their Letter had not reached them and that more important matters had engaged their attention.

Your Clerk declined to grant the Novem. 23d Certificate doubting whether General Lee could be considered as belong- ing to this State; and if so, whether the sentence of the Court Martial, confirmed by Congress, and his subsequent dismission, did not preclude him from the benefit of the Law. Your memorialist commends the cir- cumspection of a gentleman acting officially, but flatters himself, that when the matter comes to be considered between a Great nation and the Sister of a gentleman, who left his native county at the risk of his life and of a very opulent fortune, to embark in our cause, and who must be allowed to have rendered very signal services, that they will have very little weight. With regard to the first Objection, your memo- rialist begs leave to state, that early in the year 1775, soon after his arrival in America, he made a Purchase of a valuable Estate in the County of Berkeley. That before the gentleman from whom he pur- chased could give possession, he was called into the Army. That as soon as possession was given, he placed an overseer, Servants and Stock upon the Estate, and made it the place of his Eesidence to the day of his death. The sentence of the Court Martial amounted to no more than a suspension from duty for one year, and cannot by any construc- tion be considered as superceding or cashiering—His subsequent dis- mission was evidently owing to an angry letter wrote when suffering under the most painful Disease, and initiated by an account of the con- firmation of the sentence of the Court Martial against him, and an information that Congress meant to pursue further measures to his dis- grace. It was certainly never the meaning of the Legislature of this Commonwealth to deprive any man of the well earned'Rewards of his services, for an offence so venial, which the constitutional frame of the best of men often give rise to. Your memorialist therefore prays, that your Honourable Board, considering the matter on liberal and generous principals, will direct a Certificate to issue to Sidney Lee, the Sister and representative of the late General Lee, for the quantity of Land allowed to a Major General of this State; And your memorialist shall pray, &c, &c.

In consequence oi these Instructions the said Colo. Lewis deputed Col: Wm.

Great numbers of the People applied and entered their Lands accordingly, paying those Gentlemen two shillings & six pence Virginia currency pr: Tract, i. e. for every 400 acres. We are desirous to know of your Excellency and Honourable Council, whether those Entries with these Gentlemen avail the People anything— whether a Certificate from Col: Lewis' Office is of the same force & effi- cacy as a certificate obtained from your late Honourable Board of Com- missioners for the adjusting Claims to unpattented Lands on the West- ern Waters—Or whether the Idea of those Entries with Colonel Lewis were implied, or were in anywise adverted to, in the late Agreement between the two States. 'Tis true that the money paid for those Entries was but a trifle, and so ihe money paid in to the office of Pennsylvania for a Location, was but a triffie likewise: but we find their operation is such that they sweap away large and valuable Improvements. Many People here applied to the Honourable Board of Commissioners aforesaid in Order to obtain Certificates for their Lands, But could not obtain them on account of Disputes arising between them and others relative to the premises.

"That your Memorialist is an old settler, and an early adherent to the An early State of Virginia on the Waters of the Ohio, that he has by his acting se e in Office under this Government, rendered himself very obnoxious: to the People of Pennsylvania, to whom that Country has been transferred." Anxious to reside in that Country he had tried to secure his lands there, but at the time Virginia was adjusting the claims to Lands in that County, he was a Prisoner with the Enemy. From the "manner A prisoner in which the Courts of Law proceeds" in that County he cannot have justice done him, and deriving his right from this State will only be prejudicial to his Interest. Pensylvania will make no distinction between Settlers on Lands within her Charter Limits, and those in the Cession made by Virginia to her; he therefore will be required to pay unjustly a large sum of money to secure his lands, he will be subjected to every delay and mortification by the Officers of that State, merely because of his attachment to, and Service as an officer of Virginia. In addition to this, suits had been brought against Officers who had served in the Militia of Virginia under her own Laws, and many had suffered severely already in pocket & person. Situated as he is, it may easily be understood, what little security there would be in that County either for his person or property under the existing Laws of Pensylvania— This very memorial might be the cause of his arrest, when they would claim the power "to remove and keep him a prisoner at pleasure and bring him to Tryal in any part of that State, where they can procure proper creatures to condemn him." "Your Memorialist therefore craves the Protection of this state for himself and all the officers of Virginia in that Country, and prays your Excellency and the Honourable the Council to grant them such relief as in your Wisdom you see meet, The remedy - either by having the State of Pennsylvania restricted to its Charter Limits, or by reperesenting your memorilist's case to the Legislature of this State, and having a person sent to Pennsj'lvania to demand Justice for them, and Your Memorialist, as in duty bound, will ever pray, &c."

The alter- Claim for native of <entirely deserting the country or adopting this step had been t^fronUer forced upon them. Since that time this County had been ceded to Pen- sylvania, and they with many others had been made to pay very dearly for defending the country once under the Jurisdiction of Virginia. They themselves had been required to pay Five hundred and fifty-five pounds and Costs, on account of a Company of Kangers of fourteen men; and as their conduct was as officers of Virginia, & having been refused releif by Pensylvania, they are constrained to call upon Virginia to do them justice and releive them of this burthen. 80
