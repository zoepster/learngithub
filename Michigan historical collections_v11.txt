PREFACE. It is with satisfaction that the Committee of Historians of the Michigan Pioneer and Historical Society presents to that Society and the public generally the eleventh volume of Historical Collections, believing that it will be found of unusual interest. It comprises, first, the address of the president, and the reports of the other officers of the Society, given at the Annual Meeting of 1887, from which may be learned the origin, the objects and the progress of the Society. Following these are the memorial reports, which embody much of interest in the lives of early pioneers. The papers which succeed these were.nearly all read at the same meeting, and such articles as " The Ordinance of 1787," "The Constitution of the United States," "Recollections of Early Explorations" and the articles on the boundary disputes, together with the sketches of men who contributed much towards making our commonwealth all that it is at the present time, cannot fail to be of great value as well to all who are interested in " the greatest study of mankind" as to the future historian. The latter half of the volume is occupied by another installment of the "Haldimand Papers," which contains a wealth of information relative to the very early history of localities now embraced within the boundaries of Michigan and other portions of the Northwest. These papers are already attracting considerable attention from litterateurs in different parts of the country, and those published in Vol. 9, were frequently referred to by William Frederick Poole, L. L. D., librarian of Newberry Library, Chicago, in his article on "The West " in Vol. 6, of the " Narrative and Critical History of America," edited by Justin Winsor, librarian of Harvard University. They are for the most part arranged chronologically, and reference to any given period is thereby made easy. A part of the papers published under this head, those comprised in the series "Q," belong strictly to the " Colonial Office Records," but for convenience in arrangement have been classified with the Haldimand Papers proper.

ANNUAL MEETING, JUNE 1 AND

2, 1887.

ADDRESS OF THE PRESIDENT. HON. M. H. GOODRICH, OF ANN ARBOR. The Pioneer and Historical Society of Michigan: What I have written for this occasion pursuant to a wholesome and highly beneficial precedent, perforce of unyielding and tyrannical circumstances, I have been forced to write in a too perfunctory manner to be properly adapted to and befitting the occasion. I am fully aware of its too many defects and that-I have subjected myself to just criticism, therefore feel myself compelled to implore you to temper with mercy and forbearance any criticisms you may

make, assuring you that my failure will occasion me more sad thoughts and reflections than it possibly can you. After thirteen years of active and vigorous life, the question is frequently asked, " What is the Pioneer and Historical Society of Michigan, what has it done and what are its purposes and objects?" This question is asked not only by those whom some may term the non-reading, non-reflecting, plodding portion of our people, but by persons who are considered well up to mediocrity in general intelligence and current events, and occupy and hold influential and commanding positions both in the social compact and body politic. At first blush it may seem strange and unaccountable that such a question should emanate from such a source-be propounded by such intelligent people at this date of the society's life. But I think it will not seem so strange when we reflect that the people constituting our commonwealth, in common with the people of all other commonwealths which go to make up this republic, are so intently absorbed in the pursuit of their peculiar and individual callings and avocations, that a large proportion of them cannot find time to inquire the name of their next door neighbor, much less his peculiar profession or avocation. Having been asked the above question on my last trip to Lansing, a few days prior to this meeting, by a person of acknowledged intelligence, it suggested the thought that 1 could not better redeem the time allotted for the president's address on this occasion than by substituting for any address I might be capable of writing, a few rambling reflections and considerations concerning the Pioneer and Historical Society of Michigan and topics gerniain to it. In 1868 or '69 some considerable thought was bestowed, by a certain class of thinking men, upon the subject of inaugurating or formulating some system or plan by which the materials and essential'elements of a true and faithful early history of the state, hitherto uncollected and stored away in unsafe and rapidly failing and perishing storehouses-the memories of the surviving pioneers-might be gathered and put in shape for permanent preservation for the use of the future historian. This sentiment and feeling extended rapidly and soon crystallized into shape, and by 1871 or '72 a number of city and county pioneer societies were organized, and through pure pioneer energy achieved marvelous success. But it soon became apparent, however, that this system, in many essential particulars, was defective and inadequate to accomplish the objects and purposes sought, and the workers in this field, being unaccustomed to the use of the word failure, applied themselves to the task of remedying these defects. The result of their efforts and labors in this behalf resulted in the formation or organization of the Pioneer Society

of the State of Michigan, and subsequent events have demonstrated the wisdom of their action. The Pioneer Society of the State of Michigan was organized in representative hall of the old capitol at Lansing, on the 22d day of April, 1874, under and in pursuance of an act of the legislature approved April 25th, 1873, its aims, objects and purposes being to "collect and preserve historical, biographical and other information relative to the State of Michigan," to establish and preserve a museum of relics, to collect and preserve a library of books, maps, charts, manuscripts, etc., and last, but not least, to rescue from the dark, dismal and gloomy charnel hlouse of wreck and oblivion the noble deeds and achievements of the pioneer men and women of Michigan, who were and are as noble and brave an army as ever fought the battle of life, and as gallant and as heroic mariners as ever made a voyage on life's turbulent and tempestuous ocean, and transmit them to posterity as a precious legacy. This is the Pioneer Society of Michigan; such its aims, purposes and objects. The first board or committee of historians was elected February 2d, 1876, and immediately after its election entered upon the discharge of the duties assigned to it, since which time, under its and the board of directors' supervision and direction, the Society has published ten octavo volumes of Collections, averaging six hundred and fifty nine pages each, with one edition of each volume, of one thousand and eight hundred copies, making an aggregate of eighteen thousand copies and eleven million eight hundred and sixty two thousand octavo pages, requiring the writing of forty four thousand and twenty folios, or four millions four hundred and two thousand words of manuscript. In.addition to this work the Society has made reasonable progress in collecting relies not only curious but illustrative of the early life and manners of the pioneer settlers of Michigan. Also a valuable collection of manuscripts, books, maps, pamphlets, periodicals etc., etc. This, in brief, is what the Pioneer Society of Michigan has accomplished in the brief period of its existence. We venture to say without much fear of being convicted of the offense of boasting or self laudation, that every intelligent person who shall carefully and critically examine the work of the Society, will acknowledge that as historical material, it will be of essential and real benefit to the future historian, the philosophers of history, the politician and the ethnologist. We do not claim that our work is perfect, but we venture to assert that it is as free from fatal, mischievous, misleading and damaging errors as works of similar nature, and as could reasonably be expected, taking into consideration the peculiar situation and circumstances under which the Society has been placed and forced to work. Since almost every work of the human mind and hands \

has its imperfections; every landscape, however luxuriant, gorgeous, dazzling and brilliant its appointments may have been made by extravagant nature, its arid spots; our every hope and anticipation is shadowed by the clouds and chilled by the dews of disappointment; our every pleasure and joy by its handmaid, sorrow, may we not reasonably expect a pardon for the imperfections of our work and labor? We have not essayed to write history, but have confined our labors to collecting materials and putting them in shape for permanent preservation for future use; acting as it were as logographers, preparing the way for some future Herodotus, Thucydides, Xenophon or Tacitus. In prosecuting the objects and pturposes for which the Society was organized, the Society has received that support and assistance which was absolutely necessary and requisite to achieve success. The legislature in its wisdom and sagacity has, from an early period in the life of the Society, adopted and continued to the present time a liberal financial policy toward it, for which every intelligent and thinking citizen of the commonwealth is under permanent and lasting obligation and will ever hold it in kind, grateful and appreciative remembrance. When the Society called for contributions of historical materials, biographical sketches and material illustrative of the early history of Michigan, the call was responded to with an alacrity and to an extent far beyond the anticipations and expectations of the most sanguine of. the sanguine members of the Society, and the ten volumes of Pioneer Collections published by the Society, attest the inestimable and incalculable value of the service, and will ever remain an imperishable monument of the wisdom and patriotism of those who so generously and disinterestedlyperformed it. The work is not yet finished. The harvest is not all garnered yet. The gleaning is not yet reached. Much valuable historical and biographical material still remains stored away in the shadowy and faded memories of the noble little band of pioneer men and women still permitted to tread the pathE of life among us. If this valuable material is ever to be collected, it must be collected quickly. Our annual necrological reports show that this noble little band is rapidly being transferred to the great majority on the other side of " that bourne from whence no traveler ever returns." As each pioneer is laid to rest to take that dreamless sleep that knows no waking, it closes a chapter in the early history of the state never to be reopened. The literature which goes current for history is so mixed, intermixed and interlaced with novel, mere speculation, essay and ambiguous narrative, and too many accredited historians are, may be unconsciously, such strict partisans, zealots, enthusiasts, egotists, who "cast their facts in the mold of

their hypothesis," that both the student and philosophers of history are constantly beset with stubborn perplexities, difficulties and uncertainties, and are called upon for the expenditure of a prodigious amount of mental labor and toil to separate the true from the false. So constant and invariable are these perils and dangers encountered in the domain of history that many are almost persuaded to assert that the study of history is but a school for teaching skepticism. True history-the biographies of nations-is the stern light that illumines the rough and rugged path of mankind. Extinguish this light and it is a problem of easy solution to determine how soon the civilized world would return to a night of intellectual darkness as black, dismal atd gloomy as Erebus. With the accumulated experience of the past and the needs and requirements of our advanced civilization it is a primal, fundamental duty of every civilized nation to inaugurate some system or plan by which its daily history, its daily life, free from legend, inferences, bias, speculation and theory, can be recorded and preserved. The acts and deeds of the executive, legislative, judicial and ministerial officers of a nation do not constitute or make up its fall and complete history. The history of a commonwealth or nation is not complete and will be wanting in a most essential element unless it includes full and unreserved the domestic social life-the life around the home hearth-stone-of its citizens, those acts and deeds which unmistakably and unerringly discover and bring to light the principles which govern the life of its citizens, the inner life of the nation. Of what assistance in the advancement of tha material inter6sts and the higher and more perfect civilization of the human race is the knowledge that this or that nation is prosperous, happy and contented, that this or that empire or dynasty conquered and exercised hegemonic power, and in the plentitudo of its power and splendor dazzled and bewildered the nations of the earth, or that this or that nation or people once proud, prosperous and happy, went to decay and disappeared.from the family of nations, leaving nothing behind except wreck and desolation, unless we know the processes and methods by which these events were produced and the principles governing the domestic, civil and political life of these peoples? The thirteen years' experience of this Society is but cumulative evidence in support of the long since realized paramount importance of collecting and preserving the historical material daily furnished by every department of the commonwealth-social, civil, religious and political. In the interest of science and civilization, the archmologist, the antiqua

rian, the ethnologist, the anthropologist, the philosopher, the historian and the scientist traverse oceans and continents and perform herculean labors, suffer untold hardships and deprivations in search of faint, feeble and shadowy evidences of the life, cuCtoms and manners of nations and peoples which have, centuries ago, passed away and been buried in the wreck and debris of time. If a pebble from the path of Hannibal over the Alps, a few grains of sand from the pass of Thermopyla--a sliver from a stone in the Parthenon or the old Acropolis or the old Coliseum-a twig from the plains of Marathon -a piece of broken pottery or tablet from the ruins of Pompeii-a few ideographs and phonograms from the towering obelisks of Egypt, have a value and afford us-bright visions and happy memories, shall not the noble lives, deeds and achievements of those who made us the favored people among the nations of the earth, have a greater value, and bring to us brighter visions and more sacred, happier and holier memories? In view of the present defective, I might say more correctly, in the absence of any, system for collecting and preserving, in anything like an authentic or reliable manner, historical material, the Pioneer and Historical Society of Michigan has been and is directing its attention to perfecting an effective system whereby the historical material daily produced by the state may be collected and preserved. When this shall transpire it will impose new duties and obligations upon the Society, for the efficient and faithful discharge of which the Society will require not only the sympathies but the active assistance and cobperation of every one who places a proper and true value on genuine history. The rounding out of another little cycle of a year has brought the pioneers together again. Many pioneers whom it was ever our pleasure aid joy to meet upon the occasion of our annual gatherings, have the past year traveled the well beaten road to the tomb. When they took a last, lingering look on things of earth, it was with a consolation that they had fought the battle of life nobly-had rounded out life with all its work finished and finished well -and that they and their work will not be forgotten. The Pioneer Society is a source of real, solid solace to the pioneer. He knows that his life's work has a lasting, permanent place in the records of the deeds and achievements of mankind. Yes, it is a pleasure and joy beyond measure to him as he sits in life's gloaming waiting and watching for the curtain to drop in the last scene of life's drama, to know that those whom he leaves behind have not drank of the waters of Ardenne to hate him nor of the waters of the river Lethe to forget him, and that his lifeless body, once the lucky tenement of the soul, will be carefully and gently handed down to the tomb, the common storehouse of mankind, and the sod that covers it moistened with the tears of true friendship and affection.

LANSING, June 1, 1887. To the Oficers and Members of the Michigan Pioneer and Historical Society: How rapidly the years roll by: It seems but a day since we last met to exchange our annual greetings and report the year's progress of the Society's doings. But another year has passed into history, and it again, becomes my duty to report so much of the work of the Society as has been entrusted to me. The file of letters and communications received during the year is herewith submitted, all of which have received prompt attention. A copy of the State Republican containing the proceedings of last meeting was mailed, soon after the close of the meeting, to each member of the committees and also to each vice president. About the same time a notice was sent to each vice president, informing him of his election, and requesting him to secure memorials of prominent pioneers of his county who should die within the year, and a further notice about four weeks ago, reminding them of their duties and requesting from them a memorial report for this meeting. Notices of this meeting, containing a list of papers to be read, were on May 21st forwarded to each member of the Society, also to the leading newspapers throughout the state, state officers and their deputies, members of the legislature, judges of the supreme court, etc. I have to report the death of twenty five members of the Society who have died within the past year, the greatest number of any previous year. They are as follows:

ANNUAL MEETING, 1887.

REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE OF HISTORIANS. To the Pioneer and Historical Society of the State of Michigan: The Committee of Historians would respectfully report that the result of the labors of the committee, seconded, as they have been, by the pioneers of the state, have been attended by more successful results than in any previous year. The interest taken by the first settlers, in the counties most recently settled, will enable the Society to collect and preserve an authentic account of the rapid development of the state in all its varied interests. The success of the Society in procuring and publishing historical matter relating to Michigan when under the government of France or Great Britain, has attracted the attention of historical societies in other states and of persons interested in historical studies and has added greatly to the repuitation of our Society and to the interest taken in its advancement by very many of' our own citizens. The committee succeeded in procuring the publication of volumes 8 and 9 previous to the first of January of this year, snd had good reason to believe that it would be able to have volume 10 ready for delivery at this meeting, but in this it has been disappointed. The material for volume 10 was selected and ready for publication when volume 9 was delivered, but the state printers have been required to do so large an amount of work for the legislature, now in session, that they have not been able to publish volume 10. However much this is to be regretted the delay has been unavoidable. Volumes 8 and 9 can now be procured of Mrs. H. A. Tenney, the recording secretary, at seventy five cents each. Volume 8 is a book of 728 pages, and contains the proceedings of the annual meeting of 1885, the historical papers read at that meeting, of which particular attention is called to that on the " Lake Superior Country," by John, H. Forster, that on the "Iron Region of Lake Superior," by Peter White, and to those relating to the " Personal Reminiscences " of that venerable pioneer of the Saginaw Valley-Ephraim S. Williams. These, with other papers, occupy 146 pages. The memorial reports of 21 counties take up 104 pages, and the " Copies and translation of papers in the possession of the Historical Society at Detroit," cover 403 pages.

These papers are as interesting as they are important. Among them will "be found a translation of the "Pontiac Manuscript," being the "Journal or History of a conspiracy by the Indians against the English, and the siege of Detroit by four different nations, beginning on the 7th of May, 1763." The " Conspiracy of Pontiac " and the "Siege of Detroit" include the "statements of Mrs. Melroche, Charles Gouin, Gabriel St. Aubin, Jacques Parent and Mr. Pettier, who were eye witnesses of the siege of Ft. Detroit in S1763, made in 1824 to Charles C. Trowbridge, sub-agent of Indian affairs at Detroit,, and written by him at that time." This volume also contains "Pontiac's Incursions, the Macinaw Massacre and the Battle of Bloody Bridge," being "Major Thompson Maxwell's account of the incursion of the Chief tan Pontiac, including the massacre of the Mackinaw garrison, the Battle of Bloody Bridge, together with some observations of the general appearance of the territory when these occurrences took place." The papers relating to these times and transactions, as interesting and as important as any in the history of Michigan, cover over 100 pages. The other 300 pages include miscellaneous matters that date from a proclamation of King Charles 2d, in 1672, prohibiting the use of salt, to that of Col: Henry Proctor, " dated Aug. 21st, -1812, for the regulation of the Civil Government of the Territory of Michigan after the surrender of General Hull;" and many of the papers of Judge A. B. Woodward and Major James May. Also Election Rolls for Wayne County for 1799; Tax Roll for 1802; "Proclamation of Gen. William Henry Harrison, Governor and Commanderin-Chief of the Indiana Territory," issued at "Vincennes, January 14th, 1803, laying off and establishing the boundaries of the County of Wayne;" Address of the Chiefs of the Chippewa Nation, Detroit, September 8th, 1797; "C Father Marquette and the Early Jesuits," by C. I. Walker; "Early Detroit," by C. I. Walker; "c Account of a plot for obtaining the Lower Peninsula of Michigan from the United States in 1795," by J. V. Campbell; "Date of the Detroit Settlement," by J. V. Campbell; Gov. Winm. Hull's speech to the Ottawa and Chippewa nations of Indians at Michilimackinac, August 28th, 1809, and many military orders and papers relating to the war of 1812. Volume 9 has 707 pages, and contains the '"Proceedings of the annual meeting for 1886," the papers read at that meeting, which include with others, "Reminiscences of the Survey of Northwestern Lakes," by John H. Forster; "The Diocese of Michigan, What it was, What it is," by Rev. Frank A. O'Brien; "History of St. Andrews' Church at Ann Arbor," by Rt. Rev. G. D. Gillespie; "Recollections of Early Ministers of Washtenaw County," by Rev. Lorenzo Davis; and papers by Judge Albert Miller, of Bay

City, Ephraim S. Williams, of Flint, and Judge F. A. Dewey, of Lenawee county; also memorial reports from 22 counties. These papers conclude on the 221st page, and the succeeding 120 pages are devoted to the History of Ottawa County as given in "papers read at the semi-centennial celebration of its settlement held at Grand Haven, Dec. 2d, 1884." " The Haldimand Papers " occupy 316 pages and are " Copies of papers on file in the Dominion Archives at Ottawa, Canada." These are the first of a large number of documents which the committee "has procured from the Archives of the Dominion, through the courtesy of its officials, and the committee wishes to note that it has been under particular obligations to Mr. Douglass Brymner, Archivist for the Dominion of Canada for the efficient aid which he has given it, in procuring from that source, matter relating to the history of Michigan while a part of the French or British Dominion. The committee cannot too highly commend these papers to the attention of the members of the Society and to all others who feel the least interest in the history of Michigan or in historical studies. They will be found to include the correspondence of the commanding officers at Detroit, Mackinaw and St. Joseph, with Gov. Guy Carleton and Gov. Frederick Ualdimand, " Captain Generals and Governors-in-Chief in and over the province of Quebec and territories depending thereon in America," from 1776 to 1784, also an "account of the expedition of Lieutenant Gov. Hamilton," in Oct., 1778, from Detroit to Vincennes; of the capture, Dec. 17th, 1778, of the fort at that place, called Fort Sackville, by Gov. Hamilton, and of its recapture by Col. George Clark, Feb. 24th, 1779; prices current in February and April 1778; " Council held at Detroit, June 14th, 1778, with the Ottowas, Chippeways, Hurons, Poutconattamies, Delawares, Shawanese, Miamis, Mingoes, Mohawks, and the tribes of Ouashtanou, Saginaw, Delewares and Senecas." The proceedings of the council will be found to be of great interest, giving the names and speeches of the chiefs of each nation.

Every member of this Society should avail himself of the present opportunity to procure these volumes. The legislature having appropriated $2,500 each for the years 1887 and 1888, the committee feels justified in saying that, with the balance now on hand, of the appropriation for 1886, there cin be published five volumes of Collections. These will contain the proceedings of 1887 and 1888, the papers read at the annual meetings of the Society for these years, with such other original matter as is now in the archives of the Society or as may be acquired in the meantime.. "The Pioneer and Historical Society of the State of Michigan " is now established on a basis that must insure its continuance. It has already accomplished, during its brief existence, results of greater importance, in securing original historical material, than many other state societies that were organized before Michigan was admitted into the Union. " It is the intention of the Society to be Unremitting in its efforts to secure an authentic history of the settlement of every county in the more recently settled parts of the state. These, though now lacking in interest, with many readers, will, with the passage of time, come to be looked upon as being of as much or more importance than is now the history of the occupation of the state by the French and English. The degree of interest manifested in these, our annual gatherings, is a most certain guarantee of the continuance of the prosperity of the Society.

1825. He came to Saginaw in 1837, where he learned the trade of a printer, when his health failed. To improve it he accompanied his brother, Capt. David Smith, on a trip or two on the schooner, Coneaut Packet, and was shipwrecked on Lake Huron, above Goderich, on the Canada shore. They were given up for lost, and it was some six weeks before they were heard from, it being late in the fall when they put in an appearance, nearly naked aud with scarcely any shoes on their feet. There was great rejoicing among their friends when they arrived. He then commenced the study of medicine with Dr. George Davis, of Saginaw City, and graduated at the Cleveland Medical College of Ohio, in 1851. He removed to Lower Saginaw, now Bay City, the same year. He was married about this time to Miss Abbie Hart, of Lapeer, by whom he had four children. Dr. Smith was the first physician in the lower end of the Saginaw Valley. In 1861 he went into the mercantile business which he followed up to 1878, when he again assumed his profession. Dr. Smith was postmaster of Bay City for many years previous to 1861. He was an elder in the Presbyterian church from its organization until his death. WILLIAM MC EUAN. " William McEuan, one of the pioneers and business men 'who have helped to make Bay City, died at Ontario, California, where he had gone for his health, on March 10, 1887. Mr. McEuan was born in Glasgow, Scotland, March 5, 182g. He came to America in 1848, stopping first in New York, and then coming to Detroit and Chicago, at each place working as a machinist. He had learned his trade at Napier's famous works in Glasgow, and brought with him papers of recommendation from them, which, however, he never needed to use, his work recommending itself. In 1850, he with his brother, Alexander, came to Bay City, then Lower Saginaw, and built the mill at "Woodside," still known as the "McEuan Bros.' mill." Alexander died in 1853 and the business was continued by Willia'm and his brother John. February 4, 1858, he married Annie, the eldest daughter of the late James Fraser, the founder of Bay City, by whom he had six children, five of whom survive, The eldest son, James F., died in 1877, at the age of eighteen years. Mr. McEuan had been much of the time, for the last fourteen years, out of health and of active business, but still attending to many interests, and in all that concerned the growth and progress of Bay City he was always ready to do a full share. 4



Page 26
26 ANNUAL MEETING, 1887. He was of a kindly nature, and ready always to lend a helping hand to those in distress. He did not accumulate great wealth, but he left behind him an unstained name. He was a man of scientific tastes and of wide reading. He was strongly attached to the land of his birth, and, although a resident of this country for almost forty years, was never naturalized. He was obliged to take many journeys in search of health, twice crossing the Atlantic to his old home, and spending several winters in California, where the end came at last. His death is a loss, not only to Bay City, but to the lessening company of "The Pioneers." SUSAN J. MUNGER. Susan J. Munger died on the 7th of May, 1887, at her home in Bay City. She was born in Monroe county, New York, August 13, 1828. She was married to Algeron S. Munger in St. Joseph county, Michigan, in 1853. Mr. and Mrs. Manger emigrated to Lower Saginaw, now Bay City, in 1854. She had only one child, a boy, who died in childhood. Mrs. Munger was a lady much respected by all who knew her.

Snow, Mrs. Alonzo Sherwood, Win. B. Davis, Michael Hess, Chas. Evans. A VETERAN OF 1812-STEPHEN SEARLES. The subject of this sketch, whose death was announced last week, was the third son of Samuel Searles. He was born July 21, 1792, near New York City, on the north side of the Hudson river. When about 4 years old he removed with his father to Broadalbin, 40 miles northwest of Albany, and when he was 12 years old they left Broadalbin and settled at Aurora, N. Y., where he worked at farming until the breaking out of the war of 1812, when he went into the army and served until it close. He was at Buffalo when it was burned, and when the order was given for our forces to retreat and every man to look out for himself, he, with several others, volunteered to save a quantity of arms and ammunition which would have fallen into the hands of the enemy; which act they accomplished by taking a circuitous route through woods at the great risk of being captured. After the war he returned to the business of farming. In the year 1830 he married Mrs. Polly Carpenter, who lived only six years, leaving only two daughters, Mrs. D. A. Winslow, of Saugatuck, and Mrs. R. D. Parker, of St. Jdseph; together with Mrs. L. C. Stinson, of St. Joseph, and Wm. Carpenter, of Charlotte, Mich., a step daughter and step-son, to mourn his loss. In the year 1838 heremoved with his family to Charlotte, Eaton county, Mich., and with his three brothers settled on what is still known as Searles street, near Charlotte, where he remained engaged in the business of farming and building mills until the year 1852 when he removed to St. Joseph, and here closed his lifework. He was a member of the State Pioneer Society. Mr. Searles was able to be about and was down to the postoffice only a few days before his death. His funeral was held from the residence of Dr. Parker, his home, his remains being escorted to the cemetery by A. W. Chapman Post, No. 21, G. A. R. Rev. G. L. Cole officiated at the services.-St. Joseph HErald.

CALHOUN COUNTY. BY DR. 0. 0. COMSTOCK. HON. GEORGE WOODRUFF. Hon. George Woodruff, late judge of the 5th judicial district of this state, died at his residence in Marshall, Calhoun county, in the 19th year of his age, May 15, 1887. He was probably the most scholarly man in Calhoun county, and few men surpassed him in this particular. He was a sound lawyer, an incorruptible judge and a courteous, Christian gentleman. SKETCHES OF PIONEERS OF CALHOUN COUNTY. COMPILED BY A. D. P. VANÃ½ BUREIN. ELIZA P. FORD. Another of the early residents of Battle Creek is numbered with the dead. Mrs. Eliza P. Ford, wife of C. Ford, Esq., died Tuesday morning, Oct. 7, 1875, at her husband's residence, after an illness of many years, aggravated within the past few days by an attack of dysentery, which proved fatal, notwithstanding the most diligent efforts were made for her relief. This comparatively sudden termination of her earthly career was unexpected by all, save by a few friends who knew of her condition, and the announcement of her,death generally took the community by surprise. Eliza P. Ford was the oldest daughter of the late G. F. Smith, one of our most prominent and influential citizens, and was born in Leroy, Genesee -county, N. Y., on the 20th of October, 1824, having consequently nearly ended her 53d year at the time of her decease. At the age of sixteen, in the year 1838, she emigrated with her father's family to Battle Creek,-having previously received the advantages of a course of study in Miss Ingham's Seminary at Leroy. Early in the summer of 1843 she was married to Mr. Ford and has resided nearly the entire time since in this community, thus acquiring a large and extensive acquaintance. Of our early Battle Creek society Mrs. Ford was in her youth and for many years'afterward-until sickness confined her within the circle of home -one of the most conspicuous members, and foremost in social as well as benevolent enterprises. Possessed of a remarkably cheerful disposition, a vivacious and clear intellect, sound practical judgment, she commanded

universal esteem, and held a leading position in society. For several years a lingering and unyielding disease gradually withdrew her more and more from an active participation in social duties and activities, but her intimate friends and acquaintances have been permitted to witness no abatement of those noble and generous qualities of head and heart which cause her memory to be highly prized. PETER PUTNAM Died in Athens, April 23, 1875, of erysipelas, Mr. Peter Putnam, in the 73d year of his age. He had a stubborn attack, which did not yield to the best medical treatment that could be procured. I cannot speak too highly of the unceasing care and attention of the entire community. "Uncle Peter," as he was familiarly called, was highly esteemed by all who knew the good qualities of his heart. He was a native of Vermont, but came to, Rochester, N. Y., in the spring of 1825, where he married and resided untill 1842, when he came to Michigan, where, by industry, economy and integrity, he had secured a comfortable home, and where he has ever contributed to the wants of the suffering and oppressed. In earlier years he was skeptical on the subject of religion, but several years since a great change came over his mind on the subject, and he has been prominent in trying to promote the principles of pure and undefiled religion. He has been truly a father to the fatherless and the widow's friend, as it has fallen to his lot to provide a home for several relatives of his wife; also a number of his own. Providence seemed to have qualified him for this responsible duty, which always seemed a pleasure ratherthan a burden to him. At the time of his death he was the guardian of some minor children, and the attorney of parties in California having an interest here. He leaves a wife, and three children, survive him; one son and two daughters. MRS. CELIA FISH. Mrs. Fish, whose death occurred at the residence of her son-in-law, A. J. Quick, of Leroy, on Friday, the 13th of May, 1887, had reached the advanced age of 83 years, and retained to a re'markable degree her vigor of mind and body up to a short period before her demise. She, with her husband, was one of the early pioneers of Leroy township, which was named after her son, Leroy, the first male child born in the township. She was a woman of rare originality of thought, earnest conviction, strong pfactical judgment and fine social qualities, a combination which fitted her for the part she has borne in developing our community from the pioneer condition of half a century ago..

The deceased leaves nine children, six of whom were at the funeral; three sons, William, Leroy and Washington, and three daughters, Mrs. Copeland, wife of the Rev. Wm. Copeland, of the M. E. church, Mrs. A. J. Quick, and Mrs Cordelia Johnson. Mrs. Fish possessed a wide acquaintance in this section of the state by whom her memory will be affectionately cherished. We here present the concluding portion of the funeral discourse by Rev. James Berry: "We halt to-day for a few moments in the journey of life to say the last farewell over one of our number. The skeleton foot of death, which enters the loftiest as well as the humblest stations of life, has invaded our circle. But a week ago a commanding presence moved in our midst, whom we shall see no more, a cheerful companion who will no more make glad pur hearts by her happy life and encouraging words, a kind neighbor who will no more be ready with willing hands to minister to the wants of those about her, a loving mother whose labor of love for her children is ended, a witness to the power of Jesus Christ to save on earth has gone to join that innumerable company of the redeemed on the other shore. Celia Seamans was born February 2, 1804, in the state of Rhode Island. She moved with her parents to Connecticut, then to Vermont, and then to New York. In 1822 she was married to Mr. David Fish, with whom she shared the joys and sorrows, successes and privations incident to life in a new country, until four years ago, when he was taken from her side. In 1832 with her family she came to Michigan. She lived in Washtenaw county for two years, and then moved to Leroy in 1834. This was then a wilderness, but she has been spared to see the forest give place to the cultivated fields, the log houses to beautiful dwellings, the wilderness to blossom as the rose. For over fifty years she has lived here and was well known to all. Said one of. her neighbors, 'I don't think Aunt Celia had an enemy in the world. Everybody was glad to see her cheerful face and no one was more welcome to the social circle, or more sadly missed if she was absent.' Long has she been spared, but that summons to which every ear shall hearken and all mortality obey, reached her at last, and without a murmur or a fear she received it, and, folding her hands, she quietly fell asleep as an infant in its mother's arms. Eternity beckoned to one whose labors here were ended, and she sank down to rest with resignation to the decrees as they were written."

She had contracted a cold early in the previous week and had been confined to her room a few days under the care of Dr. Buckham, the family physician. But she was apparently better late in the week and the physician had pronounced her so far recovered as not to need his services further. Sunday, however, some fever had developed and he had been called again. While holding a tester in her mouth to determine the amount of fever, she suddenly uttered a cry of pain, threw up her hands and was dead. Mrs. Thomson was born in Brighton, N. Y., in July, 1819, and was educated at LsRoy, N. Y. In 1810 she came to Flint, then a little village in the wilderness, and opened a select school which was attended by many young people who have since become prominent in business and social circles. In the year 1842 she married the late Col. E. H. Thomson. Two children were born to them, only one of whom, Etward H. Thomson, grew up, however. She went to Europe twice with her husband and also spent much time with him in Washington and other important places. In this city she was

always among the most prominent, influential and beloved of women. For many years she was a member of St. Paul's choir. Intellectually she was more than ordinarily brilliant and her knowledge was both critical and extensive. She was a brilliant conversationalist. All that she had learned by study, reading, reflection, travel and observation was ready at hand to enrich her conversation. She came of an educated family. One brother, the late Rev. Charles P. Bash, was for many years secretary of the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions. Another brother, the Rev. George Bush, a Presbyterian clergyman at Brooklyn in this state, is a man noted for the extent of his learning in philosophy and theology. Another brother is Mr. B. F. Bash, a well known citizen of Grand Blanc. Mrs. Thomson's death will be the cause of general sorrow in this community, where she has been intimately known for so many years. MR. NAHUM N. WILSON. Mr. Nahum N. Wilson, one of the pioneers of this county, passed to his final rest at the house of his son, Nahaum T. Wilson, in the first ward, at four o'clock Saturday morning, May 7, 1887, at the age of 82 years. Mr. Wilson was born in 1805 in Newport, N. H., bat most of his boyhood was spent in Norwich, Vt. At an early age he evinced a great desire for knowledge, but like most farmers' sons in those early days, he had only meagre-facilities for acquiring it. He went to the district school winters only, working on the farm in the summer. But he used all his spare time in study by himself, and at the age of nineteen became a teacher. He mastered the art of surveying and later in life he made this knowledge available in this county, having done most of the surveying in the northern half of the. county for many years. Mr. Wilson married Miss Phalle R. Slafter in Vermont, in 1828. Soon after he removed to Canada, bought a farm and divided his time between its improvement and teaching school. In 1831 he removed to what was then Thread village, now the city of Flint, and worked at bridge building, millwright work and lumbering. He built the first bridge across the Flint river, the first store and the first sawmill, known as the Stage & Wright mill, and cut the first lumber in it. In 1838 he leased a farm in Vienna township and was soon elected supervisor. Soon after this he bought eighty acres of land on section 25, Thetford, which was the nucleus of what afterwards became the magnificent farm of 650 acres, with large and commodious buildings, orchards and other improvements. When the township was set off, Mr. Wilson himself gave it the name of

"Thetford" from a town in his beloved Vermont. He was clerk of the town for many years and also held the office of justice of the peace and had much to do with the public affairs of the town-was postmaster at East Thetford many years. During all his life he was accustomed to read a great deal on scientific and economic subjects, and few men had a larger fund of solid, useful information than Mr. Wilson. In later years he suffered several severe strokes of paralysis, but his mind remained clear to the last. He had risen from his bed and was dressed not more than twenty minutes before he died. The funeral was held at the house and the femains were taken to Thetford for burial, beside those of his first wife who died in 1863. He married his second wife in Vermont in 1867. Mr. Wilson was the father of eight children, all of whom are living. The first was a daughter, born in 1830, now residing with her husband in Tuscola county. The first son, Charles E., residing at Bay City, is a clergyman, as is also John N., living in Ohio. Wm. Hl. and Farwell A. are lumbermen at Harrison, Clare county, the former being a member of the present legislature. The second daughter is the wife of Win. H. Long of this city. Samuel J. and Nahum T. are the active members of the Flint Cabinet Creamery Company. All the children are persons of excellent character and bright intellects, as their father was, and, like him, are all highly esteemed. GILES BISHOP. A dispatch received by Russell Bishop announced the death of his brother, Giles Bishop, which took place at Griffin, Ga., May 24, 1887. The sad event was not unexpected, for previous announcement of his precarious condition had been made by telegraph, through the columns of the Journal. More than forty five years of Mr. Bishop's life had been spent in Flint, and he only changed his residence when ill health compelled him to seek the more salubrious climate of the south. With this end in view, about four years ago he left his beautiful home, corner Fourth and Beach streets, and located on a large plantation at Griffin, Ga., where he purchased a plantation for each of his two sons. Mr. Bishop was for more than a quarter of a century engaged in the grocery and drug business in the city, and had a large circle of friends and acquaintances who will be pained to hear that death has claimed him for a victim. Mr. Bishop was 64 years of age. He leaves four children, Henry and Jbhn Bishop, of Griffin, Mrs. W. C. Rosevelt, of Chicago, who was at his bedside during his last illness, and Mrs. W. H. Gibson, of Jacksonville, Fla. The remains were interred at Griffin, Ga.

MEMORIAL REPORT-.-HILLSDALE COUNTY. 37 MRS. HOVEY. Mrs. Hovey, wife-of George Hovey, one of the oldest and best known citizens of Genesee township, died at her home May 241, 1887. Mrs. Hovey was sick,a long time in the early spring and got better, but a relapse came and she did not rally. She was a most estimable lady and will be sadly missed in the community where she had resided so many years, while her loss to her husband and children will be irreparable. Mrs. Hovey leaves besides her husband two sons and two daughters. The eldest son, 0. M., resides in Detroit, and the younger, Fred, lives with his family at the old homestead. One daughter resides at Vassar, Tuscola county, and the other's home is in Indiana. HILLSDALE COUNTY. BY E. 0. GROSVENOR. We give below names, ages, township residence and date'of death of pioneers who have passed away during the year since your last annual meeting. Some of.these have been prominent in business, literary, professional and political circles, and have done much towards the development of the resources, moulding the character and establishing the institutions of our beloved state, and merit at our hands a more extended notice,,but the large number who during the year have been laid to rest precludes the possibility in most cases of more than the simple record of name, age, residence and date of death. In some- cases we have not been able to get the exact age. These are indicated by "q" after age given. * * */ * - \

Among those named above are two members of this society, both residents of Jonesville, and who, by reason of unusual prominence and public service, should receive special notice. No man for many years was better known throughout the state, more actively useful, or more highly esteemed and respected, than William Walton Murphy, who died at Heidelberg, Germany, June 8, 1886, at the age of 70 years. His long residence at Frankfort.on-the-Main as consul general of the United States during the entire period cbvered by our civil war, and after its close, during the Prussian war, which resulted in the annexation of the free. " "; *.... i.. -.

MEMORIAL REPORT-HILLSDALE COUNTY. 41 cities of Germany, and the establishment of the German Empire, made him nearly as well known and as highly respected in Germany as he was. in Michigan. He rendered valuable service to the United States daring the trying period of the civil war in maintaining the financial credit and placing the bank of the United States at Frankfort-one of the great centers of wealth in Europe-and during the Prussian war his position as United States consul general enabled him td render great service and to afford protection to many of the citizens of the city of Frankfort, which greatly endeared him to them, and which were subsequently publicly recognized and acknowledged. WM. WALTON MURPHY. Died of pneumonia at Hamburg, Prussia, on Tuesday, June 8, 1886. W. W. Murphy, aged 70 years. Mr. Murphy was born in Ernestown, Canada West, April 3, 1816, removing to Seneca county, N. Y., at an early age. He came to Monroe, Michigan, in 1835, where he entered the United States land office as clerk. While there he began the study of law, and in the fall of 1837 removed to Jonesville, forming a partnership with William T. Howell and opening the first law office in Hillsdale county. He practiced law here until 1861, from 1848 being associated with Hon. W. J. Baxter. He served one term as prosecutor of this county, and in 1844 he was elected representative in the Michigan legislature. In 1861 he was appointed by President Lincoln to the position of consul general at Frankfort-on-the-Main, which position he held for nine years, and has since resided there the greater portion of the time, acting as the financial representative of several American railroad companies. The first bonds of 'the United States placed at Frankfort were sold through his influence. He was a partner in the Exchange Bank of Grosvenor & Co., and in company ot one or two others was the founder of this paper, it first being published by W. W. Murphy & Co., under the name of The Jonesville Telegraph. Since then he has always manifested a warm interest in the Independent, subscribing and paying for five or six copies every year, and in many ways manifesting his interest and good will. He was one of the members of Grace Episcopal church, this place, at the time of its organization in 1838, was one of the first vestrymen, and has been a vestryman of that church for 39 years, and during 13 years of this time served as warden. He regularly contributed to the support of the church from the time of its organization to the day of his death. For many years prior to the war Mr. Murphy was an active, prominent anti-slavery man, aiding at all times the slaves in their efforts to escape from

bondage with counsel and with money, volunteering his services as a lawyer whenever occasion required. He was formerly a democrat but joined the free soil party in 1848, and the republican party at its formation. He was prominent in county and state politics, and never failed to attend a political convention when it was possible for him to do so. In 1849 he was married to Ellen Beaumont, of Monroe, who survives him. The news of Mr. Murphy's death is no surprise to his many friends. For many years he has been in failing health, and lately private advices have been very discouraging. He has long been afflicted with a bronchial affection which was undoubtedly the cause of his death. Mr. Murphy, or as he was better known, "Walt," was a man of unusual kindness of heart and disposition. He was constantly doing acts of kindness to the poor and those in trouble, which acts were never divulged by himself. Although absent from Jonesville since 1861 and undoubtedly having formed new and strong ties in his German home, he always wanted to be counted in all charitable matters here, and was ever ready to respond to a proper demand. He was widely known throughout the state, everybody liked him, and we believe of him can it be truly said he leaves not a single enemy.[Jonesville Independent.] SAMUEL S. BAKER. Died at his home in Jonesville, on Saturday, June 5, 1886, Samuel S. Baker, aged 83 years, one month and fourteen days. The deceased was born at Palmira, Trumble county, Ohio, April 21, 1803. At the age of 10 years he moved with his parents to Groveling, Livingston county, N. Y. Was married at the age of 22 years to Rachel Putney by whom he has had 12 children, but two of whom survive him. He came to Jonesville in 1840, and has since been a respected citizen of the place. He was a man of strong convictions, conscientious and high sentiment for humanity. His aged wife (also 83 years old) and two children,- Mrs. T. Harding and Geo. W. Baker survive him. JOHN T. BLOIS. In Jonesville, at his residence, Wednesday morning, June 9th, 1886, John T. Blois, aged 76 years. Mr. Blois was born in New Haven, Connecticut, in September, 1809, and resided in that state until 1833, when he made a change of residence in the hope of benefiting his health, which was then poor. He entered the popular military academy at Middletown, Conn., in 1826, and graduated in a course of civil engineering. This was at the time when there was but one railroad,

in the United States, a tram railway at Quincy, Mass. He was at the academy three years, but his health being unequal to the rough life of a civil engineer, he continued his classical studies with Rev. Luther Hart, of Plymouth, Conn. In 1832 he entered the law office of Geo. N. Briggs, of Lanesborough, Mass., who was then a representative in Congress, and was afterwards governor of Massachusetts. From here he went to Lenox in Berkshire Co., continuing his law studies, and having as a fellow student the Hon. David Davis, of Ill. He resided for a short time in South Carolina, Tennessee and Ohio, coming to Michigan in 1836. He first located in Detroit. Here he taught in the Detroit Academy and collected memoranda for a statistical, topographical and political history of the state and territory of Michigan, which he afterwards published under the patronage of the state legislature as a Gazetteer of the state of Michigan. While preparing this work for the press he found the archives barren and it was only owing to memoranda furnished by him to the secretary of state that enabled the governor to negotiate what was then called the $5,000,000 loan, for internal inprovement purposes. He came to Jonesville, which place has since been his home, in 1839, and in connection with Salem T. King opened the second law office in this village, the firm being King & Blois. In 1840 he was elected register of deeds for this county, serving two years, and was circuit court commissioner for eight years. He was Plected one of the justices of the peace for Fayette township in 1840 and served until 1844, was again elected in 1865, and has filled that position continuously sincetwenty one years. He was for a number of years engaged in the nursery business here, finally relinquishing it on account of ill health. Mr. Blois was a scientist and a man of high literary attainments. He was married and raised his family of three children here. Edwin T. of Chicago, Miss Ida and W. S. of this place survive him. INGHAM COUNTY. BY C. B. STEBBINS. June 16, 1886.-Mrs. Louise L. Woodworth, aged 60 years. She had been a resident of Lansing 31 years. June 21, 1886.-Henry Eckstein, aged 33 years.

Williams died in Williamston, Saturday, Sept. 18, 1886, aged 70 years. James M. Williams, familiarly known as" Miles," came to this place in company with his two brothers, 0. B. and H. B., and settled near the spot occupied by the present homestead, from Batavia, New York, in 1839. In 1840 they built the first dam and saw mill in this section. In 1842 they built the first grist mill, known as the Red Cedar Mill, which is still standing, a small part of the present Williamston Mills. It contained one run of stone, which were hauled from Detroit by oxen, a part of the way on wagons and the rest on sleds, the roads not permitting heavily loaded wagons. It was however a great convenience to a large extent of territory. He was our first postmaster, receiving his appointment in 1842, which he held till 1850. In 1843, at the organization of the township, he was elected its first supervisor, which position he also filled in 1844-5-6-7, '66 and '74. He was also township treasurer on two or three different occasions. In 1846 he mined the first coal in this region which was used for blacksmithing. In 1871, at the organization of the village, he was elected its first-president, which position he also held in 1873-4-5. He was almost continually a member of the school board and much of its success is due to his efforts. He accumulated a fine property, reared a family of seven children, six of

whom survive him and who are useful citizens and an honor to him and his memory. He was firm in his convictions, strong in his likes and dislikes, and naturally made some enemies and many friends, but all will unite in this, that he lived an honorable and useful life. He was the possessor of a very retentive memory and could tell the "why, where and by whom" of every transaction of importance in the history of the whole community with unerring accuracy.[Williamston Enterprise, Sept, 22, 1886. ELIJAH WOODWORTH. Elijah Woodworth died at the home of his grandson, in \Vheatfield, Thursday, D.ec. 23, 1886, aged 94 years. To the many who have known this pioneer all their lives this news will not be surprising. 'He came to Leslie in 1835, and built the first house of the town, and soon afterward put up the first saw mill. For several years he teamed between Ann Arbor and Leslie, fording streams wherever there was one. He practiced some as a physician, but did not like the profession. Once he preached the Presbyterian faith, after which he published some of his works on the Old and New Testament. In 1884 he wrote a poem dedicated to the State Pioneer Society, which was published in the Local, since which time he has been confined to the house most of the time. In the winter of '83-4 he ordered his own tombstone, aud wrote the inscription which reads as follows: "In memory of Elijah Woodworth, born 1792, who now resides in spirit life, a real personal being in progression eternally, served -in the war of 1812. A sectarian minister, an atheist lecturer up to 1852, first resident of Leslie, Ingham county.

His last request was that he be buried in Leslie but without any ceremony whatever, and designating his pall bearers. Mr. Woodworth made his home for years with his son, Solomon, and after his death he lived with his granddaughter, where he died. He has a daughter living somewhere in Ohio or Indiana.

light in their lives that will never be forgotten.-[Leslie Local, Dec 24, 1886. SMITH TOOKER. Smith J. Tooker, one of the oldest and most respected citizens of Lansing, died at his home at 410 Wall street, May 11, 1887, of paralysis. He had been gradually declining in health during the last seven years and became entirely helpless nine weeks before his death. Mr. Tooker, who was born in North Hector, New York, Oct. 14, 1819, came to Lansing with his brother. V. W. Tooker, 40 years ago. The site of the town was then a heavy forest, and Mr. Tooker witnessed all its transitions from a wilderness into the handsomest and one of the most prosperous cities in Michigan. As soon as a rude semblance of a home could be arranged, Mr. Tooker sent for his wife, who was the first white woman to locate, in Lansing. His memory was an exceedingly accurate volume of local history from the beginning, and he always felt a keen interest in everything relating to the old pioneer days. He was one of the twelve original members of the State Pioneer Society, and also an active member of the County Pioneer organization. On the morning after the recent spring election he said to his brother sadly: "Yesterday was the first time my legs ever refused to take me to the polls to vote a democratic ticket." His wife survives him, as do aldo five brothers and three sisters. These are V. W. and 0. G. Tooker of Lansing, John S. Tooker of Montana, Steven Tooker of Portland, Mich., S. A.

VALENTINE BRETZ. Valentine Bretz was-'born in Fairfield county, Ohio, Sept. 5, 1830, and died in Odessa, Ionia county, Mich., June 11, 1886. He was the son of David and Fannie Bretz, and was one of a' family of ten children, of whom four are still living. His early life was spent on his father's farm in Ohio. In 1855 he was married to Miss Sarah A. Telford, of Ohio, who survives him. There have been seven children born to them, of whom five are still living. Two years after his marriage he removed to Ionia county, Mich., and settled on the farm where he died. He enlisted in the 21st Michigan infantry, August 6, 1862, and served with his regiment until the close of the war. Comrade Bretz was a good, true soldier, always at his post of duty and with

no spirit of complaining at the hardships endured. At the battle of Stone River he received a wound in the face, a ball of buckshot entering his nose and remaining lodged in his face until last winter, when sneezing violently the ball was discharged from his nose. This wound was the primary cause of his sickness and death. He has never been in good health since he came home' from the army. There were six of his comrades, members of his company, who accompanied the corpse as bearers, all that remain of a band of nineteen that went out together. As a citizen and neighbcq, Bro. Bretz was held in great esteem, and was loved and respected by all who knew him. He hadfilled the office of supervisor and clerk of his township with fidelity and honor to his constituents. lie was a stirring and ardent republican in principle, yet in action he was very considerate and was of the conservative order of men. He was always a strong advocate of temperance. As a christian man his influence was felt in his pure and exemplary life. He was a faithful and respected member of the M. E. church. DAVID DODGE. David Dodge, whose sickness was of long standing, died at the residence of his son, Alex. W. Dodge, in Ionia, on Sunday, June 13, 1886, in the 89th year of his age. He was born Dec. 21, 1797, in Herkimer county N. Y., whence his father had emigrated from Massachusetts that same year. In the following year, 1798, when David was only six weeks old, his father returned to his native state, living on a farm in Worcester county until David was 21 years of age, when the family removed to Oxford, Mass. In 1826 they removed to Rochester, N. Y. The subject of this sketch lived in Rochester till 1843, when he came to Ionia county and bought a farm on "Long plain" in the township of Ronald, and built a house. In 1844 he removed his family to his new home. Several years afterward lie exchanged his Ronald farm for one in North Plains, where he resided till 1857, when he came to Ionia and has resided here since. While in Rochester Mr. Dodge was a mason and master builder; he constructed three churches, and the great flouring mill on the Genesee river. He with his partner excavated the great races below the first fall in the Genesee through the solid rock. The work was a failure, the parties projecting it went into bankruptcy and the contractors lost their pay. Mr Dodge then closed up his business and emigrated to Michigan. He cleared up three new farms in Ionia county. In 1855 his health failed and since 1859 he had lived in the

family of his son, Alex. W. Dodge. Deceased was twice married. His first wife, Lucina Fitts. died a year after marriage, leaving one son, who died in Rochester at the age of 29.. Subsequently he married Ruth, sister of the late Joseph L. Freeman and of Mrs. P. C. Hutchins. By her he had ten children. She died Oct. 2, 1872. Mr. Dodge lived to seen born in his family eleven children, 45 grandchildren and 9 great grandchildren, of whom 33 were boys. He was converted to the christian religion in 1831, under the preaching of Charles G. Finney, at Rochester, N. Y., and. joined the Presbyterian church, of which he was a member until the hour of death. Three sons and four daughters survive him. ALONZO SESSIONS. Hon. Alonzo Sessions died at his residence in Berlin on Saturday morning, July 3, 1886, after a lingering illness, in the 76 h year of his age. The funeral was held on the following Tuesday, from the residence, and he was buried in a grave on the farm, the spot being selected by himself. For nearly fifty years Mr. Sessions has been one of the most prominent citizens and politicians of Ionia county, and in his death a striking and picturesque figure is removed from local and state affairs. Alonzo Sessions was born August 4, 1810, in Marcellus, Onondaga county, New York. He was of New England stock, his grandfather having lived on a rough farm in the state of Connecticut. Amasa, the eldest of eleven children, was the father of Alonzo. At the age of nineteen he made his way on foot to the wilds of central New York, where he taught school and cleared land alternately, till he earned'enough to pay for a farm on the east side of Skeneateles lake, where he died in 1838. His wife, Phoebe Smith, was a daughter of Job Smith, an officer of the Revolutionary army. Her brother was sheriff of the county and member of the legislature. Alonzo was one of nine children and was trained in habits of frugality and industry and in the strictest of religious tenets, his parents being members of the Baptist church. Being a diligent student he early acquired a good education and taught school. In 1831 he went to Bennington and engaged as clerk in a store for two years, receiving as compensation for his services, board and ten dollars a month. In 1833 he left his native state for Michigan, traveling from Detroit on foot, most of the way, via Mt. Clemens, Romeo and Pontiac to Farmington, where he struck the Grand river trail and followed it through Shiawassee, Clinton and Ionia counties to the present site of the city of Ionia, where ne found five families, part of them living in unfinished log cabins, and others in Indian wigwams. He then embarked on a batteau to Grand Rapids, and thence went on foot, by way of Kalamazoo, to White Pigeon, where the U. 7

S. land office was, and entered his land. The next winter he spent in Ohio, teaching school in Dayton till 1835, when he bought a team and came through to his land on the south side of Grand river. The journey consumed sixteen days and from Marshall was through an unbroken wilderness. He built the first log cabin in the township of Berlin and the first bridges across the small streams between Ionia and Saranac. In -1837 he married Celia, daughter of Samuel Dexter, the pioneer of Ionia, and sister of the' late John (. Dexter and Stephen F. Dexter, now of Evart, Mrs. on Jones and Mrs. Tibbetts. By her he has had 13 children, seven of whom with Mrs. Sessions survive him. The farm, which at first consisted of 360 acres, increased to 800 and, though hewn out of the wilderness, has come to be one of the most valuable in Ionia county. Mr. Sessions has been greatly honored by his fellow citizens in the matter of official positions. He was the first supervisor of' Berlin and chairman of the first board of supervisors for Ionia county, and held the office, at intervals, 18 years in all. He was justice of the peace for several years; was sheriff in 1841-2; member of the legislature in the lower house in 1856-58-60; during his last term in the legislature he was appointed assessor of internal revenue for the fourth Michigan district and held this position four years. In 1872 he was a presidential elector on the republican ticket and chosen president of the electoral college. In 1876 he was elected lieutenant governor and re-elected in 1878. When the national banking law passed he, with others, started the First National Bank of Ionia, of which he has been a director since its foundation and president since 1866. In politics he was a republican. He never united with any religious denomination. He was of a stern, unyielding disposition, direct and inflexible of purpose himself and intolerant of the opinions of those who differed with him. In his business relations he was the soul of honor and he had no sympathy for the weaknesses, or charity for the failings of others, and bad a hearty contempt for dishonesty in any of its forms. His austere and cold bearing toward others repelled many who would have liked to be his friends, but if he encouraged close intimacy it must have been with a limited circle. The rugged virtues of his character commanded the respect of his fellow citizens, while he did not win their affection like men of a more sympathetic mold and with more of the milk of human kindness in their composition. Yet in spite of all this few men have wielded a greater influence in the community, or done more to set an example of sturdy manhood and honest endeavor than Alouzo Sessions. He was certainly an exemplar of personal honesty and unflagging industry, and, viewed from almost any light, his life must be pronounced a success. If he appeared to take too morose and des

ponding a view of human nature and the motives that govern men, it was perhaps because he, in a long life devoted to the study and observation of public affairs and political questions, had detected so much that was unworthy, selfish and ignoble, that his mental vision was obscured to the good that is in men. He was inclined to be a pessimist in his measure of men's characters and motives. He had a lofty ideal to which few can attain and indeed of which he himself fell short. But if we could all conie as near it, taken for all in all, as he did, it would be cause for profound thankfulness. A large number of the citizenis of Ionia attended his funeral. MRS. ELIZABETH BELL. Mrs. Elizabeth Bell, wife of Hon. A. F. Bell, who died at her home in Ionia -on Sunday night, July 11, 1886, was born in Philadelphia, August 19, 1823. She was a daughter of Joshua and Rebecca (Coleman) Boyer. From an early age her home was in Reading, Pa., at which place she graduated at the age of fourteen from the Bethlehem seminary. Her parents came to Michigan with Grov. Porter and settled in Detroit. The children were sent babk to Reading to live with an aunt to complete their education. Her mother died in Detroit in 1834. In 1838 Mr. Boyer removed to Portland, in Ionia county, where Elizabeth was married a year later, at the age of 16, to Alexander F. Bell, then a rising young lawyer. Mr. and Mrs. Bell lived in Lyons one year, and came to Ionia in 1840, where their home has been most of the time since. In 1856 she had a partial stroke of paralysis which affected one side, and from the effects of which she never entirely recovered. For many years she has suffered at times from its recurrence. For nearly a year she has been confined to the house, a great sufferer, helpless, but receiving the tender care of a devoted family. The last time she was out of the house was in August. At last she passed away peacefully and without pain, as though falling asleep. Mrs. Bell was a kind neighbor and friend, and by many acts of generosity-and disinterested benevolence attracted to herself a large circle of friends. She had seven children, of whom five with her husband survive her. She was a member of the Episcopal church. HON. OSMOND TOWER. Hon. Osmond Tower died at his residence in Ionia at 11 o'clock Wednesday night, August 4, 1886. He was out riding'during the day and no special premonition of speedy dissolution was felt by him so far as known. He retired at ten o'clock, and an hour later Mrs. Tower was awakened and found him sitting up in bed. This occasioned no surprise, as, for a year or more, he has been troubled with insomnia and difficulty of breathing,

ANNUAL MEETING, 1887.

superinduced by heart disease, and was in the habit of sitting up for relief. Mrs. Tower arose to give hin a spoonful of stimulant, but on returning to the bedside an instant later found him unconscious. She aroused the household, but he died almost instantly, and was beyond succor before anybody else could reach him. His death was quiet and painless. Physicians were summoned. but the patient had passed away before their arrival. By the death of Osmond Tower Ionia loses one more of that hardy race of pioneers who settled this county, and whose sturdy blows did so much to make the wilderness blossom as the rose. He was born at Cummington, Mass., Feb. 16, 1811. He was sixth in direct descent from John Tower, who emigrated in the year 1639, from Hingham, England, to Hingham, New England. He acquired a good education in the schools of his native town, learned the carpenter's trade and worked for ten dollars a month, teaching school in the winter until the age of twenty three, when he had accumulated $170 and decided to try his fortune in the West. Before leaving he married Sept. 1, 1834, Miss Martha Gallagher, of Albany, N. Y., adopted daughter of Dr. James Wade, brother of Hon. Ben. F. Wade. Dr. Wade had adopted her on the death of her mother soon after her arrival from Ireland, her native land. They arrived in Detroit in November. Mr. Tower worked at his trade in Detroit until stopped by cold weather, and removed to Farmington for the winter, where he engaged board for himself and wife at $1.50 a week. In the spring he returned to Detroit, and worked till fall, when he rode on horseback to Ionia, which consisted of two log houses. He went to the land office at Kalamazoo and located one hundred and twenty acres of land near Ionia. In the spring with his wife he removed to Ionia, arriving here March 25, 1836, with 75 cents in his pocket. He worked at his trade, securing work on the first school-house built in the valley. He soon built a house for himself which he sold, and built another, the old homestead on the site of the present insurance buildings, in which he lived thirty four years. The present residence, in which he died, was built in 1870. Aside from clearing his land, Mr. Tower worked at his trade until 1844, when he engaged in the manufacture of fanning mills, a business that he followed for twenty years. He was seven years a member of the firm of G. S. Cooper & Co.; six years with Tower & Chubb, foundrymen; for several years of the hardware firm of 0. & 0. S. Tower, and for many years the financial representative of the firm of Baker & Tower, makers of hot-air furnaces. In 1850 he went overland to California, returning by way of Panama in 1851. Inu politics he was a whig until the organization of the republican party and was an active member of both parties. In recent years, however, he has taken comparatively little interest in politics. He attended the first meeting held



Page 53
MEMORIAL REPORT-IONIA COUNTY.

53

in Detroit to form the whig party; in 1840 he was elected county clerk, but in 1842 was defeated with the rest of the ticket. He was supervisor several terms and from 1858 to 1862 a member of the upper house in the state legislature. He was stockholder and treasurer of the lonia & Lansing railroad company; director and president of the Ionia & Stanton railroad company, both of which were merged in the Detroit, Lansing & Northern. In March, 1863, President Lincoln appointed him U. S. marshal for the western district, a position he held until the Johnson regime in 1867, when he resigned. For most of the time since coming to Ionia he was officially connected with the public schools, and had held various other positions. He was at one time a prominent candidate for member of congress from this district, but was defeated for the nomination by the Hon. Thomas White Ferry. Mr. Tower was a man of extraordinary will, strong prejudices, positive character and unyielding disposition. He was a most devoted husband, an indulgent, kind father, an exemplary citizen. He was pugnacious, however, and always ready to fight for his rights, or for what he believed to be his rights, and he was generally able to defend himself, right or wrong. In religion he was a Universalist, and positive in matters of dogma as he was in his political opinions. He was straightforward, direct, open and aggressive in everything. People always knew where to find him. It was his nature to take sides and avow his position fearlessly. The caustic letter he wrote when he resigned his position as marshal in 1867 was a type of the utterances of the man on all subjects. Its bold and defiant tone was characteristic. But the powerful will and extraordinary physical vigor -had to succumb to the inexorable call of disease and death, and there is no doubt, that if he had a moment of consciousness to realize the presence of the grim monster, he met him with the same fortitude and intrepid front that he was able to present to the difficulties that beset him at every step of a long, laborious and useful life. BENJAMIN R. TUPPER. Benjamin R. Tupper, one of the pioneers of lonia county, died on Friday at 5 p. m. and was buried on Sunday from his residence in Bonanza. He was born in Monroe county, N. Y., Nov. 30, 1818; died Aug. 27, 1886, aged 68 years, 9 months and 27 days. He had been a resident of Ionia county 46 years. JEREMIAH STANNARD. Died Nov. 25, 1886, at his residence in Boston, lonia county, Jeremiah Stannard, in the 88th year of his age. Mr. Stannard was a pioneer of Boston,



Page 54
54

ANNUAL MEETING, 1887.

having settled on the place where he died in 1837. Four families and three young men were the only ones who preceded him in the settlement, Mr. Stannard was elected one of the assessors at the first township meeting in 1838, and was elected treasurer in 1842. He has been an invalid for a long time, and has required much care and attention. He died at the house of his son, Hon. A. S. Stannard. MRS. CORDELIA W. COOK. Mrs. Cordelia W. Cook, widow of the late R. R. Cook, died at Otisco,. Mich., on Sunday, Dec. 11, 1886. Mrs. Cook was born in Sullivan, Madison county, N. Y., on the 2d day of Oct., 1811. Her father, Alvin Cowles, died on the 27th day of Sept., 1815, leaving her mother, Mrs. Roxana Cowles, a widow with two children, the subject of this notice and a sister. In the year 1817 her mother married Joseph Davis who, with her and her children, settled in the township of Chili, Monroe county, N. Y., where they lived until the year 1826, when they removed to Michigan and settled in the town of Avon, Oakland county. On the 2d day of Jan., 1834, she was married at the residence of'her step-father to Rufus R. Cook, and in the spring of 1838 they removed to the township of Otisco, Ionia county, Mich., and settled upon a farm in a place now knowh as Cook's Corners, where they both resided until the time of their deaths. In June of the year 1870 Mrs. Cook united with the Baptist church of Otisco of which she remained an exemplary and consistent member up to the time of her death. Sister Cook was a woman of strong personalities and had a peculiar faculty of winning the affections of all with whom she came in contact. She was a devout christain and an efficient helper in every good work. Her charity was remarkable. She could never hear a person censured or their faults spoken of but she was always ready to bring forward every palliating circumstance that the case admitted of to tone down the asperity of the accuser. She died at the ripe age of seventy five years. EDWARD STEVENSON. Edward Stevenson was born in England nearly 68 years ago, and with his father and several brothers and sisters he settled in Ionia about 44 years ago, where he has chiefly resided. He became active in business life and one of the foremost among its honest, public spirited citizens. He was active and influential in all political movements and one of the first in Ionia to help organize the republican party. As the party became strong, and the democratic party grew weak under the storm of the prevailing anti-slavery agitation, internal conflicts arose within the republican ranks, mainly caused by



Page 55
MEMORIAL REPORT-IONIA COUNTY.

55

the distribution of official favors within the gift of the party. In these contests Mr. Stevenson always took a bold and aggressive position, either for or against the men of his choice. He fought a great many political battles, not only against the common enemy, but against those whom he deemed the unworthy pretenders within the republican ranks. These partisans, whom he regarded as the hay and stubble rubbish of party politics, he opposed openly and manfully. He was always a magnanimous political manager, never resorting to acrimonious personal invective to down a political opponent. He was a steadfast friend to those who had his confidence in all social and political stations in life, and was more anxious to grant a favor to a friend than to receive one. But his earthly labors are finished and he has gone to his reward. Whatever of good he has accomplished will long be remembered in his favor, while his mistakes, if any, will be set down as among the inevitable to the common humanity in the struggles and perplexities of human life, where none are perfect. He was an active business man, acquired considerable property, and was generous to a fault, and was honored with many distinguished official positions. He held the office of justice of the peace, postmaster of Ionia, and register of the land office at Ionia and at Reed City, and against his integrity and efficiency in his official or business career there never was a breath of suspicion. We have been intimately acquainted with him during the past 40 years, and have ever been proud to claim him as one of our most valued personal friends. As one of the pioneers of Ionia county, he will long live in the memory of a host of personal friends who enjoyed his familiar acquaintance during his busy and somewhat eventful life. He died at Stanton, Jan. 4, 1887. MRS. JANE DINSMORE. Mrs. Jane Dinsmore, widow of the late William Dinsmore, died at Portland on Saturday, Apr. 30, 1887, aged 75 years. Mrs. Dinsmore, with her husband, came to Portland from the state of New York in 1836, and consequently had resided here more than half a century. Their former home was in Caryville, near Batavia, N. Y., where Mrs. Dinsmore made a profession of religion and united with the M. E. church. When they came to Portland not a tree had been cut where the village now is, and for years after it was not unusual for deer and other game to pass among the trees standing where our residences now are. All old residents remember the enfeebling sickness that followed clearing the land, and from which no settler was exempt, nor can they ever forget that hunger from scarcity of provisions in the earlier years was not unknown. Mr. Dinsmore bought of the government 76 acres of land on section 34, at the head of the mill pond on the Looking Glass

river, but at first made his home in a log house, where is now one of our principal streets. Mr. Dinsmore was the shoemaker of the village; dividing the time between working at his trade and clearing his land. In the privations of those years Mrs. Dinsmore was like a ministering angel to the sick in the neighborhood. When not prostrated by sickness herself, she went among her less fortunate neighbors, tidying up their sick rooms, and in a thousand nameless ways relieving the despondency of those nearly or quite discouraged. She possessed a very cheerful disposition, and always maintained a hopeful exterior, sympathizing with the distressed, bearing the burdens of those weighed down with grief, and pointing to a bright prospect when the clearings in the woods should be made larger, and the air should be purified from the miasma of decaying vegetation. When the Universalist church was organized in June, 1852, she was a constituent member and maintained her membership there while she lived. THOMAS J. MARSH. Thomas J. Marsh, late of the town of Orange, Ionia county, was born in Tyre, Seneca county, New York, February 7, 1812. He came to Michigan in the fall of 1835 to Calhoun county, leaving that section with his brother James and arriving at their new location March 4, 1837. Their choice was on section five, town 6, range 6, lonia county. On this a shanty about 12x16 was built which sufficed for a shelter till the summer of 1838, when quite a commodious log house was built large enough to have two rooms. In the spring of '38 a sister came on and kept house for the Marsh brothers. James, being a surveyor, left for the west in 1840. Thomas was married about this time, 1841, to Miss Nancy Crawford, of Seneca county, New York. Several children were born, only one of whom was a son. Thomas J. Marsh died Friday, May 6, 1887. His education was obtained at the district school. LEONARD GOODRICH. Leonard Goodrich was stricken with paralysis while visiting at the residence of F. Sloan on East Main street, lonia, for a few days before going, as was his intention, to spend the summer with his son in Dakota. He grew gradually worse, and May 16, 1887, passed peacefully away. Deceased was born in Rutland county, Vermout, December 29, 1805, and when about 21 years of age moved with his father to Ohio. December 23, 1827, he was married to Jane Standish, sister of the late Hon. J. D. Standish, of Detroit. She died September 17, 1852, leaving, besides her husband,

two sons and three daughters; one son, N. S. Goodrich, of Dakota, and two daughters, Mrs. Henry Taylor, of Minneapolis, Minn., and MArs. Win. Butman, of Illinois, still being alive. Mr. Goodrich afterward married Mrs. Henrietta Andrews, of Plymouth, England, who also survives him. He had resided in Ionia about thirty five years, twenty five years of that period being engaged in the grocery business, in the pursuit of which he made many friends by his uprightness as a man of business, and his daily walk as a man among men. He was for many years a consistent member of the Baptist church, and a kind and indulgent husband and father. MEMORIAL. BY A. F. MOREHOUSE. David A. Simmons died at his residence in the village'of Portland on Saturday evening, October 6, 1883, aged 79 years. Mr. Simmons, with his family, came from the state' of New York to Michigan in 1836, and bought land lying on both sides of the.Looking 6lajs river, on sections 9 and 10 in the township of Eagle, Clinton county. By his own labor he soon had a large clearing and a comfortable log house and barn. In those early days every house on a traveled road was a house of entertainment, and there are yet many among us who remember the Simmons house on the east bank of the Looking Glass river, about five miles east of Portland, on the direct road from Detroit to Ionia. In 1849 he removed to Portland because of its educational advantages to his children. For a few years he was proprietor of the hotel, where the Welch house now stands. After be disposed of this, he was temporarily absent in California for a couple of years, and on his return he opened a jewelry store on the corner of Kent and Bridge streets. Some years afterward he bought his late residence on the west side of Grand river, which he prepared for his home for the remainder of his days. Mr. Simmons was no politician, and though often importuned to accept local office, would never consent, preferring the enjoyment of private life to the vexations of official position; yet he was tenacious of his opinions of men and measures, his preferences being with the republican party. In his views he was firm and but seldom changed. In his early years he was connected with the Christian denomination, but about four years prior to his death, during the series of meetings held by Rev. Mr. Rowland, his opinions of scriptural teachings were revised, and he accepted in all its fullnes the divinity of Christ, and while his preferences were with the M. E. church, yet as Mrs. Simmons was ia member of the Congregational church, he desired to be free to go with her to public service, and did not therefore openly unite with any S: "

denomination. His social qualities were of the first order, and his genial smile was as well known as was his countenance for the past forty years and upwards. He also possessed a fine taste for the beautiful in art and nature and never tired of his examination of them; in this respect his taste was a proverb to all who knew him. For several years past his health had been declining, but on the day before his death he was seen on-the streets as usual. On the day of his decease he arose and made a fire in the stove and soon after was seized with a congestive chill, from the effects of which he rapidly sank and expired about 8 o'clock in the evening. Thus as the years roll on, one by one of those'first settlers who came here in theirlearly life are, with their locks silveredlwith age, and revered by their fellow citizens, passing to the endless future beyond, where age knows no years and infirmities are unknown.

decorations for the grave of the late Bert Gibson, their old time friend and traveling companion. Yesterday afternoon, June 6, 1886, about 1:30 o'clock, Douglas Gibson, father of the young man mentioned above, and Mr. Irwin called upon Mr. C. R. Knickerbocker, and before coming back, Mr. Gibson attempted to show his friend some of the attractive parts of Jackson, and in doing so, overtaxed himself. As they were going home they met. Mr. M. Harmon, and stopped to talk with him in front of B. S. Chapin's residence. Mr. Gibson suddenly took a long breath and dropped on his knees. He was caught in this position by the two gentlemen, who attempted to lift him on his feet again, but he gave only one or two gasps and died. They carried him to W. T. Gibson's residence, 501 South Jackson street. Mr. Gibson was born at Crown Point, N. Y., 1827, and came to Michigan in 1830 with his father, Amase Gibson, and married a daughter of Albert Howe, who survives him. He was one of the unfortunate firm of Gibson & Western, "interest and deposit" bankers, and, since the failure, has been broken down in health. For some time past his health has seemed better, and only yesterday he was heard to remark that he felt better than fpr a long time before.-Jackson Citizen. MRS. BATHSHEBA ORR. Died at her residence in the village of Concord, of Bright's disease, June 11, 1886, Mrs. Bathsheba Orr, aged 59 years. The deceased was born in England, and, when three years of age came to this country in company with her parents, and first settled in Pennsylvania. At the age of seven years she camr to this state, and has since resided in Hillsdale and Jackson counties. At the age of 24 she was married to Lovell Bullock, with whom she lived until his death, which occurred in 1870. In 1875 she was married to Adam Orr, who still survives her. The deceased leaves one child, Mrs. Frances A. Stiles, who deeply mourns her loss. WILLIAM CAPRON.

She leaves one son, Marcus W., living in Dakota, and one daughter, wife of M. L. Hess. THOMAS McGUIRE. Thomas McGuire, who had been an inmate of the county house for several years, died July 10, 1886, from the effects of a cancer in the face. The deceased was an old resident, having moved here 40 years ago, and has many relatives in and about the city. His age was about 75 years. MILO K. CRAFTS. The death of Milo K. Crafts, of Grass Lake, July 18, 1886, is announced. Mr. Crafts was a pioneer of this county, having lived on his farm near Grass Lake for thirty five years. His age was 63 years. MATTHEW W. HATCH, Matthew W. Hatch, known among his many friends for years past as "Elder" Hatch, died Tuesday, July 27, 1886, aged 72 years. He had been sick many months, in fact he had never recovered from a shock of paralysis which occurred last summer. The " Elder " was a plain spoken man, honest, sober and industrious, never hesitating to speak the truth. Beneath his rough exterior there lay a heart of unusual kindness. Everyone respected him and his words were always accorded an honest hearing. He leaves a widow and three children, all grown. JUDGE DAVID JOHNSON. At 3: 30 Wednesday afternoon, July 28, 1886, Judge David Johnson died at his residence, No. 321 West Main. street, after a long illness. His death had been expected for some time, as he was unconscious and the physicians were powerless to revive him. The immediate origin of his fatal illness was blood poisoning, resulting from a slight wound in one of the fingers of his left hand, hastened by the infirmities of age, as he had nearly completed his 77th year. David Johnson was born in Genesee county, New York, October 20, 1809, and for almost half a century practiced law in this city, coming to Jackson in 1837, when it was an insignificant looking and unpromising village. He served as school inspector in 1839 in connection with his law practice, and in 1843 was elected prosecuting attorney, performing his duties with a degree of ability that attracted attention throughout the state. While serving in this capacity he was elected to the state legislature in 1845, when Detroit was the capital, and Mr. Johnson took an active part in the fight over

6ANNUAL MEETING, 1887.

the removal of the capital to Lansing. He favored Jackson as the more central location, but the lobby was against him and Lansing was selected. In 1851 he was elected circuit judge, and filled the position with recognized ability for six years, acting meanwhile, by virtue of his office, as one of the judges of the supreme court. When his term expired he returned to the practice of law with his former partner, Samuel Higby, until the latter was elected circuit judge, when Judge Johnson formed a partnership with Isaac M. Crane and subsequently with fM. V. Montgomery, now commissioner of patents in Washington. He was also a senior member of the firm of Johnson & Hawley and prior to that was a partner of the late Phineas Farrana. Of late years he maintained an office alone except when assisted by his son Walter, who is now in Washington officiating as a legal examiner of patents under Commissioner Montgomery. In 1864 Judge Johnson was the democratic candidate for congress from this district, but was defeated by the late Judge Longyear, of Lansing. In 1848 he built the residence where he lived and died. His first wife died the same year, and a few years afterward he went to Rochester and married Mrs. Adelia A. Chipman, widow of Judge Chipman, who died in this city in the winter of 1884. A few months ago he married again, thus leaving a widow and two sons. One son, Capt. Franklin Johnson, served with distinction in the civil war, and subsequently settled in New Orleans, where he died of yellow fever. His surviving sons are Dr. Henry Johnson, of Caseville, Mich., and Walter Johnson, of Washington. Judge David Johnson was an eloquent and vigorous speaker and ranked high among the strongest advocates in the state. He was a fine scholar, a diligent reader and always thoroughly posted on current events. He had a remarkably fine mind and might easily have taken rank among the foremost men in the state. BETSEY M. CASE. Betsey M., widow of the late Morgan Case, died of general debility, at her residence in Napoleon, August 4, 1886, in the 75th year of her age. She was a native of Washington county, N. Y., and came to Napoleon, in the fall of 1832. In the spring of the same year the first settlement was made and of the settlers of that year only two survived. She leaves one son, Warren, residing on the old farm in Columbia. MRS. ELIZABETH BROWN. Mrs. Elizabeth Brown, relict of Andrew Brown, died Aug. 4, 1886, of enlargement of the heart, at her residence, 502 Detroit street, aged 69 years.

He also operated flouring mills.

MEMOIRIAL REPORT-JACKSON COUNTY. 63 MRS. GEORGE TIBBITTS. Mrs. George Tibbits, of Napoleon, died at her home Wednesday afternoon, Aug. 11, 1886, after a protracted illness, aged 79 years, 5 months and 4 days. Mrs. Tibbitts came to Jackson county in 1846 with her husband, who survives her. NORMAN ALLEN. Norman Allen, whose funeral was held Aug. 16, 1886, at the Baptist church, was born at Whiting, Vermont, Dec. 4, 1804, and was neary 82 years years of age. He moved to Leoni in May, 1833, where he kept a hostelry. His nearest neighbors were two and one half miles distant, and so desolate was the location that in 1837 he resolved to return to the village of Jackson, and for over forty years he has been an active citizen. He leaves two sons, Charles Allen, of Chicago, and Norman Allen, of Leslie, and a daughte'r, Mrs. Judge Reeves, of Little Rock, Ark. CALEB NICHOLS.

HARRISON LARRABEE. Harrison Larrabee died Sunday morning, August 29, 1886, at his residence No. 708 Greenwood avenue. Deceased was one of the early settlers of Jackson county. DANIEL FELLOWS. In the death of Daniel Fellows, August 30, 1886, Jackson county loses one of her oldest pioneers and Henrietta an esteemed citizen. Mr. Fellows was noted for his great industry, strict integaity and exemplary christian life. He was emphatically an old school gentlemen-a man of few words, and who always said "yes" and "no." He retained till the last those fine notions of honor formed in his youth, when this county was almost a wilderness, and neighbors were few and far between, who depended largely upon one another for companionship and help, and who esteemed a favor. Mr. Fellows was a lifelong democrat, and never swerved from his first choice. For the last twenty two years he resided on the west bank of Pleasant Lake, where he leaves a good property to his two grown-up children, Andrew and Ann. His wife died several years ago.

EDWARD SELLERS. On Sunday afternoon, September 19, 1886, our citizens were shocked at the announcement of the death of Edward Sellers, Esq., who died at his home on Cortland street on Saturday night. On Saturday Mr. Sellers was in the enjoyment of good health, and spoke of feeling well. Saturday night he retired to his room, and on Sunday morning he was not called, as it was his custom to rest on that day, and his family did not arouse him. After noon he was called, and not answering, it was discovered that he was dead. Physicians were summoned, and an examination revealed that he had died of paralysis of the heart, and probably passed away on Saturday night, soon after retiring. Mr. Sellers had many warm friends, and the intelligence of his death Was received with sorrow by a large circle of acquaintances. He was a genial, upright man, a warm friend, and a good citizen. His age was 63. He was born in New York City, and removed to Dexter, in this state. He had been engaged in railroad work for thirty five years. He ran the first sleeper on the M. 0. R. R., and was the first passenger conductor on the J., L. & S., and has retained that position ever since. His urbanity, devotion to duty and faithfulness won him many friends. Fourteen years ago he was badly injured in an accident that occurred just below this city, but after being extricated from his perilous position, he did not stop to attend to his own injuries, but at once looked after the welfare of his passengers. Mr. Sellers leaves a wife and four children: Mrs, H. E. Southworth, of Chicago; Mrs. W. 0. Heyser, of this city; Mrs. W. B. Knickerbocker, who is in Colorado, and Miss Minnie Sellers. Mr. Sellers served as alderman of the First ward for a time very acceptably, but refused a re-election. He also declined other offices of trust. He was a member of Jackson Commandery, K. T. A good citizen, a kind husband and a loving father is taken away by the death of Edward Sellers. JACOB HUTCHINS. Jacob Hutchins, a pioneer of Jackson county, and one of the best known men within its borders, died Sept. 23, 1886, at his residence in Summit, aged 82 years. The disease from which he died was dropsy, with which he suffered acutely the past three months, although for years past he has been afflicted with kidney trouble. Jacob Hutchins came to Jackson county from the east about forty years ago and settled on land in Summit, now owned by Gilbert Wilson, removing some years later to the farm now known as the Hutchins place, midway

between the farms of Daniel S. Holcomb and Jacob Crouch, where he lived continuously until his death. His intimate knowledge of the Crouch family and his public expressions of animosity towards the Holcomb family made him a conspicuous witness in the examinations of the Crouch tragedy, and had he lived he would be a witness for the prosecution in the trial of Judd Crouch. In his later years he was regarded as eccentric, and his testimony at the trial of Daniel S. Holcomb created merriment hard to suppress in the court room. His rugged strength fitted him admirably for the hard life of a pioneer, and he prospered with the development of the country, leaving at his death a fine property for his children, valued at upwards of $20,000. His wife died nearly 20 years ago. The family consisted of three sons and six daughters. Of the sons Alonzo and George are living; John L. died some years ago. Of the daughters Diana married Peter Cranmore, of Summit; Anne married George Hatch, of Spring Arbor, and is dead; Cordelia married Leroy Goldsmith and is dead; Laura married Abram S. Drake, of Hanover; Hannah married Orlin Parmeter, of Spring Arbor, and Viola, the youngest daughter, is also married, but our informant did not know her husband's name. All the living children reside in Jackson.county. THOMAS E. LUSK. Thomas E. Lusk, of the machine company of Lusk & Co., died Sept. 29, 1886, at the residence, No. 516 East Main street, of pneumonia, after an illness of but four days. Mr. Lusk leaves a family, consisting of a wife and three children; a daughter, Mrs. N. El. Eckler, and two sons, all of whom reside in the city. Mr. Lusk was born in Orange county, New York, in 1825, and came to Jackson in 1854, in company with Henry Vaudercook, and together they established the machine and foundry firm which Mr. Lusk has continued since, the present firm being T. E. Lusk, Geo. Holton and A. J. Weatherwax. For twenty five years he was a member of the volunteer Jackson fire department, of which he was made chief in 1867, continuing in office fourteen years. He was an active member of Jackson Lodge, No. 17, F. & A. M. CHESTER WARRINER. Chester Warriner, a prominent resident of Jackson, where he has lived for 35 years, died at his residence, No. 402 First street, Thursday evening, Oct. 7, 1886, at 8 o'clock. The immediate cause of his death was lack of nervous force to rally from the shock occasioned.by the amputation of his left leg below the knee on the Wednesday previous. The disease was of five years' growth, caused by failure of arterial circulation in the lower extremities, 9

resulting in necrosis of the bones of both feet. It originated in a callous on the right foot which penetrated to the bmne, requiring the amputation of a portion of that foot three years ago. The amputation was successful and the disease was arrested, but it broke out again some months ago in the left foot and resisted all surgical attempts to check it. Several weeks ago Drs. Main and Williams removed two of the toes from the left foot, and again on September 26 amputated the foot, but without good results. The wasting of the bone continued and on Wednesday morning a third amputation was made by Drs. J. and F. W. Main, assisted by Dr. E. W. Kimball, who informed Mr. Warriner that the chances were against his recovery, but it was the only hope of saving his life. lie accepted the chance and directed the surgeons to proceed. He never rallied from the shock but continued to sink until death intervened. Chester Warriner was born in Genesee county, New York, Feb. J6, 1820, and came to Michigan in 1844, settling in Napoleon township and locating a farm, now occupied by his nephew. Jan. 1, 1845, he was married to Lucy J. Weeks, daughter of James Weeks, who had previously located in the same town. In 1850 Mr. Warriner came to Jackson to take the position of deputy sheriff, his brother-in-law, Amos Pickett, being then sheriff. He served two years in this capacity when he was appointed deputy warden at the prison. He remained at the prison two years, when he went to Chicago as lost baggage agent for the Chicago & Alton railroad, which position he resigned a few years later to accept that of customs examiner under Col. M Shoemaker, collector of the port of Detroit. He remained in Detroit three years, when he returned to Jackson and for a number of years was city marshal, previous to the organization of the police force. In 1863 he entered the grocery business with Job Hobart, under the firm name of Hobart & Warriner, doing business at the northeast corner of Main and Mechanic streets till 1869, when he retired from the firm and was out of business for a year. In 1870 he embarked in the drug business with E. J. Weeks, the firm name being E. J. Weeks & Co. They opened in the Merriman block and remained there till 1882, when they moved to the present location. R. F. Latimer was admitted to the firm in 1884, since which time the firm name has been Weeks, Latimer & Co. Mr. Warriner held many official positions in the course of his active business career, and was noted for his sterling integrity and strong practical methods of dealing with public affairs. He was appointed a member of the board of public works in 1873, and occupied that position to the date of his death, having been several times president of the board. He helped organize the Coronet Corset Company, of which he was an active director and stock

holder, as well as vice president of the European Featherbone Company, whose factory is located in Paris, France. He was also a member of the State Board of Pardons, under appointment of Gov. Alger, although he was known to be a very active and outspoken democrat. He never neglected a public duty and was invariably present at every meeting of the boards of which he was a member. Some years ago he served the people as an alderman from the Fourth ward. In March, 1853, he was admitted as a member of Michigan Lodge, No. 50, F. and A. M.; he was also a member of the Druggists' Association, and an honorary member of the Jackson Greys. His wife, two brothers and one sister, besides several nephews and nieces, survive to mourn the loss of an honest and upright man. He had no children. Wherever Mr. Warriner was known he was esteemed and admired for fearless integrity, straightforward honesty, business sagacity, and genial, companionable qualities. He will be missed by a very large circle of friends, chiefly among the older residents of Jackson. JONATHAN KING. News of a tragedy at Spring Arbor reached this city Monday. Jonathan King lived about five miles from the city in the above township, the homestead being about a mile west of the coal mines. On December 15th, last, he suffered a stroke of paralysis, rendering his right side useless and depriving him of the power of speech. Several days ago his physician informed him that he had done all he could for him, and the news left Mr. King very despondent. Friday afternoon, Oct. 11, 1886, his daughter, Mrs. II. A. Harrison, left him in the house for a few moments, about five o'clock. When crossing the yard in returning to the house she heard a report which she thought was a a screen door slam. On entering the house, her father, whom she had left in the sitting room, was lying prostrate on the kitchen floor. Mrs. Harrison attempted to lift him up, and not until she saw the blood and the gun did she realiza what had happened. Her father was dead when she reached him, having been killed instantly. Mr. King for some time past has been able to walk a little, and had gone to the kitchen, taken down his rifle, a 38 calibre, and, placing the muzzle at the back of his head, fired. The ball passed entirely through the skull, finding egress at the left temple, and was picked up on the floor, battered out of shape, by Mr. Harrison, whom Mrs. Harrison at once called into the house. Deceased was a pioneer of Jackson county, having come here fifty years ago from New York state. He was 71 years of age, the father of twelve children, nine of whom are still living, as is also his wife. Seven of his children live in this county, as follows: May, now Mrs. O. J. Storms; Frances, now

Mrs. W. C. Borner; Harrison; Cynthia, now Mrs. M. G. Borner; Alice, unmarried; Jessie and George. His other two children are Leonard King, living in Emmet county, Michigan, and Melvina, now Mrs. Q. S. McAllister, who has removed to the west with her husband. The deceased was a very energetic man, and noted as a hunter in this part of the state. MARK S. HITCHCOCK. After a long illness, Mark S. Hitchcock died at his residence, No. 506 West Main street, Oct. 18, 1886, in the 66th year of his age. Some weeks ago Mr. Hitchcock was stricken with typhoid fever, but had nearly recovered, when a severe cdld developed a chronic urinary trouble which ended his life. Mark S. Hitchcock was born in Ontario county, New York, in 1821, his parents, Manly and Chloe Hitchcock, being natives of Waterbury, Conn. They moved to Lorain county, Ohio, in 1824, and lived in Cleveland until their death. While a youth Mark Hitchcock worked on a farm summers and attended district school winters until he married Miss Polly Morgan, at the age of twenty years, and then engaged in buying and shipping live stock for several years, after which he embarked in the grocery business, which he followed in connection with farming until 1864, when he was elected sheriff of Lorain county and held the office for four years. He removed to Jackson county in 1868 and purchased the farm three miles north of this city, which he owned until last year, when he sold it to Charles R. Durand, and bought the store, No. 188, in the Durand blocc. In 1879 he bought the hardware stock of Rice & McConnel in this city and managed it one year in partnership with his son-in-law, Geo. W. Fifield, who then sold out and a new firm was organized January 1, 1880, with Mi. S. Hitchcock, Reuben E. Clark and Charles S. Hitchcock as partners. Three years later Mr. Hitchcock sold his interest in the business and the firm became Clark, Helmer & Houk, who conducted the business a year and then transferred it back to M. S. Hitchcock & Co., the present firm. In 1880 Mr. HIitchcock purchased an interest in the Eureka Coal Co. and was elected superintendent and treasurer the same year. Mr. Hitchcock's first wife died in May, 1854, leaving five children, and two years later he married Mary A. Bush, of Lorain, Ohio, who survives him. During his illness all of Mr. Hitchcock's children were at his bedside, but, with the belief that he was recovering, his son Henry returned to his home in Nebraska some days ago, and his daughter, Mrs. Henry Kennedy, returned to her home at Tougaloo, Mississippi. The other children are Wallace W. Hitchcock, grocer, of 504 North Blackstone street; Mrs. George W. Fifield, 420 Williams street; Mrs. David Town, of Blackman; Charles S. Hitchcock,

No. 240 West Main Street, and Miss Clara, who resides with her parents. Mr. Hitchcock was a prominent and active member of the First M. E. church, a man of good business ability and highly esteemed by a very wide circle of friends. ALFRED DRAPER. Alfred Draper, an esteemed member of the First Methodist Episcopal church, Jackson, was born in Otsego county, N. Y., in 1810, and died in Jackson, Mich., Oct. 31, 1886. In 1814 his parents moved to Erie county, N. Y., where Alfred lived in the parental home until young manhood. In 1833 he sought and found the Lord, and to the end of life remained a faithful disciple and a diligeht worker. He gave to the church of his choice both time and means, that its interests might be promoted. He was faithful in attendance upon public services, in storm and sunshine, in winter and summer, by day and by night. In an official capacity he served the church as class-leader, steward and trustee. In 1836 he married, and two years later came with his family to Michigan, and settled in the town of Rives, Jackson county. At that time the south central part of the state was very new. Sixty Indians camped within a few rode of Mr. Draper's house; wolves were nightly visitors, and by them he came near losing his life in going to the spring for a pail of water one night after dark. He continued to reside on his farm of nearly 300 acres until eight years ago, when he came to Jackson to reside, that he might have les- care and enjoy better church privileges. He was the father of eleven children. Two died in infancy; Mary, a much loved daughter, wife of L. O. Beebe, died January 23, 1880; eight sons survive. Of these four live in California, one in Iowa, one in Illinois, one in Ohio, and one on the homestead in Michigan. I bless God that my life has been passed with such a good man, I am thankful that my children had so worthy a father. They can look with honorle pride on his life and character. He died in perfect peace and full of trust and hope of a blessed immortality. [Eliza 0. Draper.]' JOHN M. UNDERWOOD. Died, Nov. 1, 1886, at his residence in Sandstone, of old age, John M.

Smith, of Bright's disease, at the age of 56 years, occurred at the family residence, on Stewart avenue, Dec. 5 1886. His death is universally lamented by our citizens, by whom Mr. Smith was highly respected as a representative business man. Mr. Smith was one of the type usually termed "self-made men." His birth occurred at Stafford Springs, Conn., July 8, 1830, where he resided until 12 years of age. His parents, Calvin and Mary Smith, then removed to Michigan, settling on a farm at Armada, north of Detroit. When a young man, Mr. Smith left his father's farm and went to Adrian, where his brother David was foreman of the Lake Shore & Michigan Southern railroad shops, and entered the shops, with the desire of becoming an engineer. In 1855 he came to Jackson, owing to the death of Cyrus Fenton Smith, his brother, and father of Dr. Cyrus Smith. Cyrus F. Smith was the

proprietor-of the American hotel, afterwards the Marion house, and F. L. Smith managed the hotel property for his brother's family for a time, ultimately selling out to J. B. Pierce. The name of the hotel was changed to the Marion house just before the war. When D. B. Hibbard purchased the Hibbard house, Mr. Smith was engaged as clerk, which position he retained after Messrs. Gannison & Spencer bought the property, until 1864. He then received his appointment as quartermaster of the 29th regiment Michigan infantry, and served two months, when the 29th regiment was consolidated with the 28th regiment, and Mr. Smith received his honorable discharge. He then returned to Jackson and kept the Marion house for a year. Then he purchased the old Tremont house property, on the site of the.present Hurd house, assuming charge in 1865. On the 6th of October, 1868, the hotel was burned. In 1869 it was rebuilt and named the Hurd house, after John S. Hurd, father of his business partner, L 0. Hurd, and also father of Mr. Smith's wife. Smith & Hurd conducted the Hurd house until September 1, 1886, when by the advice of Mr. Smith's physician, the hotel was leased and the furniture sold. Since that time (but for a short interval, when he held an interest in a grocery store: Mr. Smith has sought rest and recuperation, as his health had already given indications of becoming seriously impaired. August 14, 1862, Mr. Smith married Miss Addie Hurd. In 1869 he was elected to the state legislature, and, there being a special session called, he served at Lansing two years.

ANNUAL MEETING, 1887.

Gilbert Stuart was a man in every sense of the word, and was made so from his early training by a good mother. When a boy he worked nine months on the farm and attended school three months in each year. He was the oldest of seven children, and until he married and left home he managed his mother's farm; be was a dutiful son, and a father to his younger brothers and sisters, but notwithstanding his limited chances of procuring an education, he made such good use of his time at school, that hbe acquired a good practical education, and has of late years officiated as one of the school board. He showed good judgment in the management of the school, and in the education of his own family. He knew but little about the laws of the country; he,was a law unto himself; looked to nature and his own conscience to guide him in the right path, and this he conscientiously followed. He resided on a beautiful prairie farm about one mile south of the village, and the teams in attendance at his funeral reached from the farm to the village, to the number of 105, and followed his remains to the cemetery. DR. NATHAN M. THOMAS. The funeral of Dr. Thomas who died April 7, 1887, took place in the afternoon and was largely attended, and mostly by old pioneers who had been intimately acquainted with him for 40 to over 50 years, and who entertained for him the highest respect. He was a man of postive convictions, arelative of the late Secretary Stanton, and partook largely of Mr. Stanton's determined will to never yield a position after he was satisfied he was in the right. But few men in Michigan did more to abolish slavery than Dr. Thomas; he talked about it, he wrote about it, he distributed documents pleading the black man's cause, he furnished those escaping from slavery food and shelter, and counseled them how best to proceed on their way to freedom; he was amongst the first to assist in organizing the republican party, which caused its final overthrow, and it has been one of the most gratifying episodes of his later years to not only live to see slavery abolished, but to know that those once in slavery are fast becoming self sustaining, intelligent citizens. He was of Mr. Lincoln's opinion that no man is good enough to govern another man without that othor man's consent, and although his position in the early stage of the abolition discussions caused him to almost stand alone in that community, he lived to gain the friendship of all, and died very much respected by both young and old.-[Kalamazoo Telegraph, April 11, 1887. WILLIAM HARRISON. I William Harrison was born in Frederick county, Virginia, January 17, 1790, and consequently was 97 years, three months and nine days old at his death.

The deceased was the oldest of 17 children. On the 27th day of August, 1820, he was married to Miss Sally Hampton, who died October 7, 1825. He was again married, March 20, 1828, to Miss America Harrison, who died Nov. 8, 1874. The first wife left him three children, Basil, Jeremiah and James, all of whom are dead. The second wife left him 11 children, Beersheba, Martha, Aaron, Sally, Joseph, Spencer, Olive, America, William, John and Hannah; of whom Sally, Joseph, Olive, America, John and Hannah are still living. The deceased moved onto the farm on which he died in Charleston, Kalamazoo county, in 1830, and held the plow to turn the first furrow in the township. He died, leaving 26 grandchildren and nine great grandchildren. The name Harrison is suggestive. His lineage is traced away back to the time when General Harrison held a commission under Cromwell; Benjamin Harrison, father of President Harrison, a signer of the Declaration of Independence, and a warm friend of Washington, was his great uncle. His grandfather, who was also named William, was with Washington in Braddock's expedition and often referred to the terrible day at Monongahela and the charmed life Washington seemed to bear. His father was Judge Harrison, so well known in this county, who was its first white settler, and to whom its developments owe so much. The deceased, so familiarly known to everybody as "Uncle Billy," possessed a genial temper and a kind heart to a marked degree. He was kind to the poor, a good neighbor, scrupulously honest, proud of his integrity and honor, the first to spread his tent in Charleston, and the last to leave it by a road, the pathway of which bears no impression of passing feet. The most conspicuous of all landmarks is torn down. While we pay the last tribute of respect we carry to his last resting place one of few faults and many virtues. [Kalamazoo Telegraph, May 3, 1887. The development of this county owes much to the above list of pioneers. Each and all performed well their part, and whilst we regret to lose so many familiar faces from among us, it is consoling to know that nearly all lived beyond the allotted age of man and were ready and willing to die. SKETCHES OF PIONEERS OF KALAMAZOO COUNTY. CONTRIBUTED BY A. D. P. VAN BUREN. GODFREY KNIGHT-A CENTENARIAN. The widely known, greatly respected and esteemed pioneer and citizen of this county, Mr. Godfrey Knight, died Sunday, Feb. 23, 1887, at 2 o'clock A. M. at his home in Schoolcraft. Up to about Christmas time he had been in his usual vigor and good health, which were remarkable for one so old; he



Page 76

76 ANNUAL MEETING, 1887. became low spirited, which was also a marked change, for he was a man of unusual spirits. His daughter, Mrs. Wood, arranged a dinner party for him, and quite a number of his old friends were present and a very happy time was had, the good effects of which was apparent on the old veteran. But in a little while he became ill; pneumonia set in. He was sick with this about 40 days and on Saturday last he seemed to be free of it. But he was left in so weak a condition he could not survive and death came as above stated.. Godfrey Knight was born in Roscommon 6ounty, Ireland, May 26, 1786. He was raised a farmer, was superintendent of a large farm of 1,800 acres for his cousin, Wm. Knight, for elevenyears, during which time, in June, 1822, he married Ann Kenny. In 1832 he came to this country and soon after settled in Schoolcraft. He purchased a school section in that town and afterwards a portion of the James Field farm, giving him 200 acres of as good farming land as there was in this county. He has resided on that farm ever since. Mr. Knight was a man of marked character and genial nature. In the early days of Schoolcraft he was among the first in all sports, was an athlete, and above all, a wit and story teller and the center always of an assembled crowd. His vivacity and ready repartee always made him popular, and, indeed, the last mentioned characteristic remained with him to the day of his illness. He has always enjoyed good health; his was a happy disposition, and it is thought that one reason for his remarkably prolonged life was this peculiarity. He was a temperate man, though not a total abstainer. His presence was that of a hale, vigorous, well made gentleman of the old school, with color, form and feature, step and action of a man of 70, rather than a man who claimed to be nearly one hundred and one years old. He was a noticeable figure at all the pioneer gatherings, which he enjoyed greatly; and others enjoyed to have him with them. By his labors and good business abilities he had amassed a comfortable fortune. His life has been an uneventful one save as above. He has never sought office or held official position. He has been a life long democrat. He leaves four sons and one daughter, William, John, Jerry and Godfrey, and Mrs. Mary Wood. WILLIAM E. BELLOWS. William E. Bellows, of Climax, died at his residence Monday, Feb. 14, 1887, after a long illness. Mr. Bellows was born at Saxton's River village, Vt., in 1806. He was a great grandson of Col. Benjamin Bellows, an army officer in early colonial times, to whom was granted large tracts of land in the vicinity of Bellows Falls, from whom the falls and the town take their name. At an early age Mr. Bellows removed with his parents to Charlestown, N. H., where he remained until 1837. At about the age of 18 he was

77

apprenticed to learn the cabinet-maker's trade and worked for some time at that business, but the labor proving too great for his constitution he abandoned it. Mr. A. T. Prouty, of Kalamazoo, was a fellow workman with Mr. Bellows in the cabinet shop. Subsequently he learned the butcher's trade, which he followed for about 10 years previous to his moving west. In 1837 he moved with his family to Michigan, where two of his sisters, Mrs. M. Hodgman and Mrs. W. E. Sawyer, had preceded him. He settled on a farm in sections 4 and 5 in the township where he has remained ever since. The farm is not what would be considered a good one for Climax, yet by good management and economy he amassed a good fortune from it, much of which in late years has been distributed among his children. He was married twice and leaves a widow and a son and five daughters, children of his first wife. They are: Prof. C. F. R. Bellows, of the State Normal School, Mrs. Annie E. Whitney, Mrs. Marion H. Adams, Mrs. Jennie M. Decker, and Susie H. Adams, all of Battle Creek, Mich., and Mrs. Agnes L. Ashby, of Lincoln, Neb. THE LATE MRS. JOY AND EARLY REMINISCENCES OF MAJ. EDWARDS AND FAMILI. Mrs. Julia S. Joy, who died Nov. 16, 1886, was a very early comer to western Michigan. In 1828 her father, who was a prominent resident of Detroit (an intimate friend of Gen. Lewis Cass, president of the territorial legislative council for the yearly sessions of 1828 and 1830 and a leader in social and political matters in that city), left Detroit with his wife and 10 children to secure a home in western Michigan. They set out with three covered wagons. After leaving Ypsilanti they struck the Chicago (Indian) trail and their first camp was at Dearborn, the second at Sheldon's, and from that point they left the settlements, except a few scattering squatters, and they were few and far between. Scarcely the face of a white man was seen, while often at night they would be disturbed by the noise of drunken Indians near their camp. After 18 days of travel they reached Beardsley's prairie, Cass county, now Edwardsburg, named after Maj. Edwards. There on the margin of a beautiful lake in view of the prairie, finding a log cabin vacant which had been vacated by some adventurer, this family took up their abode, and their first night's rest in that cabin, the major afterwards said, was one of the most agreeable of his life, after that long and tedious journey through that trackless wilderness. The next morning Father Edwards had one of the wagons brought up and took the children out to show them the prairie. It was then one vast flower garden and the children could not suppress their wonder and enthusiasm at such a profuse and lavish wealth of flowers. The land office. was established at White Pigeon in June, 1831, and Maj. Edwards



Page 78

ANNUAL MEETING, 1887.

was appointed register and Thomas. C. Sheldon receiver, and the Edwards family removed to that place. In May, 1834, the land office was removed to Kalamazoo and Maj. Edwards and family and Mr. Sheldon and his family removed to this place. Mrs. Joy was not the youngest sister, as previously stated; her sister, now Mrs. Scott, of Detroit, being entitled to that place. The Edwards family were very prominent in social and political circles of Kalamazoo for a long time, but after many years death and removal left but Mrs. Joy and Mrs. Walter here as the sole survivors of the family. Mrs. Walter died several years ago. Mrs. AtLee came here from Washington after the death of her husband. Mrs. Joy leaves a husband and two children, Mrs. George Davis and Mrs. Edward Dayton. When the Edwardses came here there were but a few scattered families and the place gave but little promise at that time of its present position among the cities of Michigan. The Elwards mansion, which formerly occupied the corner of Main and Edwards streets, is still standing on Edwards street just north of that corner. MRS. THOS. S. ATLEE. This lady died March, 1887, at the residence of M. N. Joy, Academy street, Kalamazoo, aged 70 years. Mrs. AtLee was a daughter of the late Major Abram El wards, at one time one of the most prominent officials in Michigan, and one of the leading citizens of the territory as well as of this place. Mrs. AtLee and her sisters have resided here most of the time since 18341, and from the first have been highly esteemed and occupied a high position in society and the regard of a large circle of acquaintances. The death of Mrs. AtLee's husband was a crushing blow to her, their devotion to each other being of the strongest character. She is the last but one of the daughters of Maj. Elwards, Mrs. Jai. Scott, of Detroit, alone surviving. Oliver Edwards, of Chicago, and Alexander Edwards, of Cheboygan, are the only brothers living. THE VENERABLE OBRA BUSH. Orra Bush died at his home on north Church street, Kalamazoo, March 9, 1887. His age was 92 years and 11 months. Deceased was born in Massachusetts, April 17, 1791. At an early age he removed to Skaneateles, N. Y., and afterwards to Oswego. Early in the thirties he removed to Calhoun county where he purchased a farm and worked it until about 1841, when he purchased the place in Charleston which he made famous as the postoffice and stage exchange from 1842 till the Central road was finished to Kalamazoo. Mr. Bush purchased the premises of the state in 1841, but previously it had been occupied as a tavern by H. P. Fletcher and Peter Fulton. Soon after Mr. Bush and his son Henry W. became

79

the owners of the premises they built a frame barn 35 by 45 feet, and in 1851 erected the first brick house in Charleston. This stage exchange, so promimeat in all matters connected with the history of Charleston, was a landmark and a noted hostelry throughout the land, for few were the travelers by the stage coach who did not remember with pleasure and sound far and wide the praises of the table and the genial character of the host. It was a very large house and stood by the old territorial road on section 16, near the junction of the road east to the river and Augusta. It was the headquarters of the township, the postoffice, the place of holding township meetings and a general center. In connection with the house was a large farm and Orra Bush and Henry, his son, were as good farmers as they were hotel keepers. Orra Bash was elected supervisor in 1856 and 1857. For years before, and after that time, he was a regular delegate to the whig and the republican conventions and was a staunch defender of his party. It is now about twenty years since Mr. Bash removed to Kalamazoo. He has been well and able to be ab)ut and attend to business until the past winter. Gradually he has failed of late, and his death was the result of old age. He leaves a wife and one son, Supt. H. W. Bush, of this city. The deceased was a man of much independence of spirit and large capabilities, was a trusted friend and neighbor, outspoken in his opinions and a citizen whose efforts were always for the right. His life has been a long and eventful and useful one, and his record a good one. His birthplace was Cheshire, Mass., and he first settled in Michigan in Eakford, Calhoun county. A few years ago there were but few if any men better known throughout the county than Orra Bush. "MRS. W. H. COLEMAN. The death of Mrs. Coleman, of Oshtemo, widow of the late William Harrison Coleman, took place on Sunday, March 13, 1887, at the house of her son-in-law, Mr. Henry Buckhout, where she had been visiting for a short time. Mrs. Coleman was born in the state of Vermont in the year 1808. She, with her husband, were among the first settlers in the village of Kalamaz)o, having come there in 1833; from Kalamazoo they moved to Oshtemo in the year 1836, where she has ever since resided. She was converted in early life and ever took a lively interest in the cause of religion and Sabbath schools. She died of old age, the powers of nature gradually failing until "the weary wheels of life stood still." MRS. MARY DANIELS. Mrs. Mary Daniels, wife of D. H. Daniels, one of the earliest pioneers of Gull Prairie, died at the home of her daughter, Mrs. S. Cornings, near Gales

burg, Oct. 2, 1886. She came with her husband to Gull Prairie in 1832, where she spent a large part of her life in Michigan. Mr. Daniels was among the first merchants in Battle Creek, where he lived for a number of years. A PIONEER OF 1885. Peter Johnson, who built his log cabin in Ross, this county, in 1835, and turned his wild lands into an excellent farm, died at his late home in thisplace, Saturday, June 18, 1887, aged 81. He was an industrious and thrifty farmer and a good citizen. JAMES LINDSAY. James Lindsay, an old resident of Climax, died on Thursday, Feb. 17, 1887, at the residence of his daughter, Mrs. Clarence Day, in South Climax. Mr. Lindsay has for years been a widower, and has lived alone much of thetime at his residence in this village. He leaves two sons: James, living in: Kansas, and Alexander, living in Colorado, and one daughter, Mrs. Day. EDWIN M. CLAPP. Edwin M. Clapp. one of the best known and prominent pioneers of this. part of. the county, died at his late home in Kalamazoo, ion Sunday, the 9th of January, 1887, of heart disease. He came from Cambria, Niagara county,. N. Y., to Michigan in 1831 and secured his land, and removed here in 1832. He settled first on the Isaac Clark farm just south of the village, which heimproved. He afterwards improved the farm now owned by Thaddeus Clapp, where he lived until 1873, when le removed to Kalamazoo. He was an exemplary member of the Congregational church. He was supervisor of this township several years, which position he filled in a very satisfactory manner. As a citizen he was respected by all who knew him. Mr. Clapp was one of the most prominent pioneers in the east part of Kalamazoo county, and one of the most successful farmers in the county. His name will ever be connected with the history of this part of Michigan and he will be referred to as a notable example of what a man with an honest purpose, a brave heart, and thrift and perseverance, can accomplish. He accumulated a large property for himself, and aided much in making Kalamazoo county one of the richest and most prosperous counties in the state. THOMPSON T. LAKE. Mr. Lake was born in Providence, R. I., 1809; came to Michigan in 1835, settling at Yorkville, Kalamazoo county. He was a carpenter and joiner by trade, and lived in the house that he built at Yorkville fifty years. His death

Mason Sprague came to Michigan with his father's family in 1835, settling in East Leroy, Calhoun county. He, some thirty years ago, removed to Augusta. Kalamazoo county, and lived there until his death, which occurred in March, 1887. COL. DELOS PHILLIPS. The sad intelligence of the death of Col. Delos Phillips fell like a shock on this community, though to quite a number of friends it was not wholly unexpected. His death occurred Feb. 23, 1887, at his residence, No. 436 Dutton street, Kalamazoo. The cause of his death was softening of the brain. The loss to this city and to his friends is a very severe one. Col. Phillips has been a resident of Kalamazoo since June, 1866, an ever active and influential member of the community. He has had an unusual share in the progress and advancement of Kalamazoo. In nearly every movement which tended to advance her interests he has been among the foremost. He was alwsys ready to labor on commitees which had for their purpose social, benevolent or material benefits. He possessed energy, push, fertility of expedients and the tact and way of winning success, bringing him into connection with the innumerable movements for the benefit of the city. He was among the first to move and one of the most efficient of the movers for our new court house. Delos Phillips was born in Hamburg, Erie county, N. Y., Oct. 24, 1839. When six years of age his parents moved to Ypsilanti. He is the second of eight sons, six of whom are now living. He devoted himself to study in his school life, so that at the age of 15 years was prepared for a scientific course in the university. The next four years were passed in preparation for a full classical course under Prof. Estabrook and Hon. S. M. Outcheon. At the age of 17 he taught school at Augusta and Nankin. In the fall of 1859 he entered the university, in the regular classical course. He made excellent progress in his studies and high honors of the university seemed to be his. He was elected president of the students' lecture course in June, 1861. Notwithstanding the fact that but little time more was needed to complete his course in the university, he enlisted as a private in the 17th Michigan infantry. He carried a musket through the terrible battles of South Mountain and Antietam. For gallantry on the latter field he was promoted to the posi11

tion of second lieutenant. In July following he was made first lieutenant, and in October of the same year (1863) was made captain of his own company. He was present at every engagement of his command until captured in May, 1864, at Spottsylvania court house. He effected his escape from the cars in North Carolina, and arrived in safety at the Union lines in Charleston, Va., after traveling 300 miles in the enemy's country. He arrived at Detroit in due time and was'placed in command of the military district of Lake Superior and assisted in raising the 28th and 29th regiments, being made lieutenant colonel of the 28th, and commanded it from its organization in October, 1864, till December the same year.. In January, 1865, he resigned and returned to Marquette to go into business, when President Haven of the university tendered him a diploma on account of his services as a soldier, upon his studying eight weeks, and he was chosen valedictorian of his class. In June, 1866, Col. Phillips came to Kalamazoo and entered on the business of manufacturing and selling musical merchandise. In 1868 he was elected state senator and made a fine record in the senate, though the youngest member of that body. He was chairman of the committee on military affairs and was a member of the committee on reform schools. In 1876 he was presidential elector and was sent to Washington as messenger. He has since that time held many offices in this town; has been supervisor for many years, and was supervisor of the third ward of this city when he died; has been deputy oil inspector and been prominently connected with various societies. He has been a republican from the first and a valuable worker in the party, and was four years chairman of the county committee. Col. Phillips has been three times married. His first wife was a resident of the eastern part of this state and died in 1867, leaving one child. His second wife was Miss Lizzie Bruen, sister of Mr. George T. Bruen of this city. They were married at Lansing in 1872. She died in October, 1883, leaving three children. On Christmas day, 1885, Col. Phillips married Mrs. Josie Burch of Allegan, formerly of Lowell, this state. She survives him, as do his four daughters.

MEMORIALS AND RESOLUTIONS OF OLD RESIDENTS' ASSOCIATION OF GRAND RIVER VALLEY. J. MORTIMER SMITH. Died Dec. 4, 1879. At the meeting of the Old Residents' Association of the Grand River to attend the funeral of the late J. Mortimer Smith, a committee consisting of Hons. John T. Holmes, Robert P. Sinclair and John Ball presented the following resolutions which were unanimously adopted, with directions that copies be furnished to the widow of the deceased and the press: Resolved, That the intelligence of the death-of our associate J. M -, * Smith, is received with sorrow. That hip early settlement in this section, in his business enterprises in this county, and the adjacent county of Ottawa, by their extent, the energy with which they were prosecuted and their influence in developing the country and promoting the welfare of the pioneer inhabitants entitle him to our respect and grateful remembrance. That we recall with melancholy pleasure the many instances of his liberality to the poor, his sympathetic aid to the sick and suffering, and the acts evincing his public spirit and the full performance of his duty as a man and citizen.

ANNUAL MEETING, 1887.

That we express our condolence with the surviving wife and our assurance of commiseration for the loss of her life companion, known to us amid so many and varied experiences of pioneer settlement. HENRY PENNOYER. Hon. Henry Pennoyer died at his residence in the township of Crockery, Kent county, April 30, 1886, of cerebral apoplexy, after an illness of a few weeks, aged 77 years. He was one of the leading spirits in conducting the affairs of this county at an early day, among the very foremost in the promotion of every enterprise, agricultural, moral, social and educational: He was also a leader in the political movements, and much of the prosperity of Grand Haven, his early residence, and of Crockery township, his later abode, and of other portions of the county generally, is due to his formulating hand and his quick, far sighted perception. Ottawa county has lost one of its oldest and most venerated landmarks. Hon. Henry Pennoyer was born at Norwalk, Fairfield county, Conn. When ten years of age he removed with his parents to Cayuga county, N. Y. In 1834 he took up his abode in Chicago, 111.; soon after married Miss Harriet Kells, and after a two years' residence in the city, he sought a home in the then territory of Michigan, settling at Muskegon, then a part of Ottawa county, and, on its full organization, was elected its first sheriff. In 1838, and by a commission signed by Amos Kendall dated Jan. 3, 1838, he became postmaster of Muskegon and continued as such until 1843, when he removed to Grand Haven. His first wife died in 1852, leaving four children, and in 1853 he was married to his surviving widow, by whom also he has four children. In politics Mir. P. was a staunch democrat of the old school, and has been highly honored politically, having held the offices of justice of the peace, supervisor, and several other township offices, county treasurer, deputy collector of customs at Grand Haven, representative to the state legislature for 1849, and state senator in 1859. A man whom the people delighted to honor has fallen. SOLOMON O. KINGSBURY. The death on Sunday, May 16, 1886, of Solomon O. Kingsbury removes another from the ranks of the old residents of Grand Rapids, a man who has been familiarly known and universally esteemed on these streets for upwards of forty years, during most of which time he has resided on Fulton, just south of the head of Monroe street. He was born in Connecticut, May 2, 1812, and soon after the family moved west to Painesville, Ohio, where he received the education of the common schools. In early life he followed the calling of clerk, and afterward the mercantile business. In 1836 he married Melinda Bond,

a native of Rutland, Vt., with whom he lived a pleasant domestic life till her death, nearly seven years ago. In 1848 he was elected county treasurer, and again in 1850, serving four years. Then, after a mercantile life, he opened in 1858 a real estate and insurance office and in that business continued until quite recently. In 1866 he was elected to the state legislature, and in 1867 was appointed postmaster, which office he held about two years. He was a man of quiet habits, always busy, an estimable citizen, who will be much missek and especially by all pur older residents. He leaves a daughter, Mrs. Tinkham of this city, with whom he has resided since the death of his wife, and a son, Gaius P. Kingsbury. a resident of Muskegon. LOREN M. PAGE. Loren M. Page, one of the quiet and yet always active citizens of Grand Rapids, "whom everybody knew," died on Sunday, May 16, 1886. He was one of the very early comers, a pioneer. He was born at Concord, Vt., March 29, 1811, and his boyhood was spent on a farm. Then he learned the painter's trade, serving a three years' apprenticeship in Canada, and working there some seven years, when, at the age of 23, he returned to Vermont, alternated between painting and district school teaching, till the fall of 1836, when he came to Grand Rapids. Soon afterward he married Miss Jane Soper. He passed a life of incessant labor-was one of those never happy without work-and experienced almost all phases of alternate success and reverses, hopes and disappointments-always an unpretentious man, yet companionable, social and friendly. Five sons went out to the wvar, and one of them returned without feet, both having been shot off. Mr. Page stuck to labor till very near his last days, and maintained a good degree of cheerfulness and geniality. Old residents, those who have been familiar with his daily walk for almost fifty years, all remember him kindly, and sigh even while feeling that a good man has gone to his rest. MILTON C. WATKINS. Milton 0. Watkins died at his home in Grattan, on Sunday, May 16, 1886, aged nearly 81 years. Mr. Watkins was another of the pioneers of this valley and one of the organizers of Grattan township. He was its first supervisor, elected in 1846; also its first justice of the peace, chosen in the same year, and was supervisor again in 1857. In 1867 he was a member of the state constitutional convention from this county. He was a representative in the state legislature at the session of 1859, and a member of the state senate at the sessions of 1863-'64-'65. A thoroughly upright citizen,

88 ANNUAL MEETING, 1887. and a man of character and influence, his was a long, busy and useful life, and in his decease the town and county lose a valuable and everywhere highly esteemed member of society. HENRY JEWETT. AMemorial Resolutions. At a meeting of the Old Residents' association, held Sept. 1, 1886, called to attend the funeral of Henry Jewett, it was, on motion of W. N. Cook, Resolved, That we heard, with deep sorrow, of the sudden decease of our associate, who, although advanced in years, was a few days since moving amongst us with his usual activity, and exhibiting his usual demeanor of kindness and affability; as ready, as he ever has been, to take his part in the duties and responsibilities of life; that we review with pride his many years' record of usefulness in the public offices in which he was placed; the universal recognition of his worth in the respect and confidence of the community of whch he was a citizen, and in the love of his relatives and family. Resolved, That this testimonial of our regard and this expression of our sympathy with the grief of his surviving children, be conveyed to them by our secretary in a transcript of these resolutions, and by publication of them in the journals of the city. ROBT..SMITH. At a meeting of the Old Residents' association, called to attend the funeral of Robert H. Smith, on the 21st day of November, 1886, the following memorial and resolutions were, on motion of Thos. B. Church, adopted: Robert H. Smith was born at Watertown, Connecticut, in the year 1819. He lived for a time in Rhode Island and came into Michigan, to the Grand River valley, in the year 1844. Early in life he had "followed the seas," and long voyages through the Indian ocean had made him "an able seaman," and like all "old sailor men" he delighted in his latter days to "follow his courses" by the charts he possessed, and often examined amongst the great islands and through the circuitpus channels of navigation, in that remote region of the world, and indulged in reminiscences of the scenes and people he had visited. After a brief residence in the town of Ada (where he married a Miss Ward) he came to this city, then village, and was employed as a clerk and manager in the business office of Henry R. Williams, then in the full tide of his various enterprises of plaster manufacture, steamboating on Grand river, and general merchandise. Since that time Mr. Smith has been our fellow citizen, quietly, steadily and unostentatiously doing what he found to do, and by economy, prudence and fair dealing, accumulated sufficient for his plain wants and tastes, and won the respect and honorable estimation of all who dealt with him and met him, in social and other personal relations. Those who knew him well recognized his good judgment, his kind heart and his loyal adherance to his convictions, in political and -in all other responsibilities devolved upon him by his position. He leaves a widow and two daughters; a household of affection and happiness, the head of it now removed in his mature years, by the inevitable call of death;therefore Resolved, That we tender our condolence to his family, with the expression of our



Page 89

89

high regard for the deceased and of our sorrow for the removal from our thinning ranks of one of this association's most worthy members; Resolved, That our secretary be directed to place on record this memorial statement, and to transmit a copy thereof to his bereaved family. HOLLIS KONKLE. Jan. 5, 187. The board of supervisors at its session yesterday morning adopted the following resolutions in respect to the late Hollis Konkle, formerly a member of the board, and a memorial page will be given in the book of records of the board: WHEREAS, This board has learned with sorrow of the death of our former esteemed fellow citizen and associate on this board, Hollis Konkle; therefore Resolved, That we hereby record our appreciation of his uprightness and integrity as a citizen, of his fidelity and efficiency as a public officer, evidenced by his frequent election to positions of the public service and public trust, and to the high esteem in which he was held by all who knew him. That we tender to his afflicted family our sympathy in this their bereavement. R. B. Loombs, J. W. WALKER, H. H. IVES, " JOHN STEKETEE, "Committee. JOSIAH R. HOLDEN. Died March 19, 1887. Josiah R. Holden was born in Groton, New Hampshire, February 22, 1797; came west and settled in Cook county (now Mill county), Illinois, in 1834, eight miles from Joliet. He was married to Joanna T. Danforth at Groton, N. H., January 24, 1825; lived with his family in Illinois till 1843; from thence went to New Albany, Floyd county, Indiana; came to Michigan and settled in town of Byron, Kent county, in 1845, and has resi'ded in this county ever since. He was the father of six children, three of whom survive him; C. H. Holden, of Reed City, Mrs. Fanny H. Fowler, of Manistee, and E. G. D. Holden, of this city. Being one of the earliest pioneers of this county, he was one of the first to clear away the forests for farming purposes, several fine "eighties" in Byron and Wyoming townships certifying to the telling blows of the hardy pioneer ax, and his unremitting energy in transforming wildernesses into some of the finest farms to be found in Kent county. His life has been mostly that of a farmer, though at various times during his life he has traveled quite extensively and came to be a man of broad and liberal views. He was an earnest reader and had a mind well stored with historical facts. From the time previous to the war of 1812 up to date there was scarcely a historical incident of any moment but that he could



Page 90
90,ANNUAL MEETING, 1887.

vividly recall and depict in glowing terms. His memory was remarkable in retaining dates, scarcely ever missing the exact period of any great event that happened during his life. That he was a man of iron constitution is evidenced in the fact that sickness or disease were not known to him, and until his recent taking to his bed on account of old age has never been compelled to submit to a physician's care. He hardly knew what physical pain meant, and up to the moment of his last breath was seemingly free from it, never uttering a word of complaint from the time of his prostration to his final taking off, some eight weeks. He was a thorough temperance man and a radical in politics, always adhering strictly to his party principles. On several occasions he has held offices of trust at the gift of his fellow townsmen. Of a family of 14 children born to his parents he was the oldest of chose living at the time of his demise and three members survive him, aged respectively 75, 83 and 86, his brother living in New Hampshire being the oldest, and two sisters, residents of Boston, all. from first New England families. His wife, 87 years old, survives him. GEORGE G. GRIGGS. On the 24th of March, 1887, George G. Griggs died at St. Mark's home. Mr. Griggs was born in Princeton, N. J., on December 1, 1815, coming to Michigan in 1838. He married here a Miss Marsac, and went to St. Louis, where he engaged in business and gained considerable wealth. In 1862 he returned to this city and purchased a farm on South Division street, giving his time and means generously to the furthering of public interests and lending a helping hand to the needy. He was at one time grand master of the I. 0. 0. F. of Michigan, a prominent member of the agricultural society of the state and a prime mover in the establishment of the Northwestern Michigan Agricultural and Industrial society. He was also one of the foremost of the men who furthered the organization of the Agricultural college at Lansing. In later years, after a life of business success and social prominence, through misfortune and financial reverses he became impoverished, and at the same time failed in health and became crippled. As a last resort he bravely went out with his pop-corn basket, and the bent and enfeebled form of the pleasant mannered old gentleman will be remembered by many who have observed him at the Union depot with his basket by his side and little imagined the life history of the aged pop-corn vender. For the past two years he has lived at St. Mark's home, earning almost enough daring the summer months to maintain himself there for the year. Some comforts wibh which he was not able to supply himself have been furnished by the I. O. 0. F., and under their auspices the funeral was held, assisted by the Masonic fraternity.

MRS. BAKER BORDEN. Mrs. Mary A., wife of Capt. Baker Borden, a much esteemed resident of the West Side, died at her residence, No. 20 Turner street, March 31, 1887, at the age of 60 years. She was a member of the Old Residents' association, having come to this city in 1854. Her first husband, James A. Belknap, died in 1870, and November 10, 1872, she was again married, to Baker Borden. She was the mother of ten children, seven of whom are now living. Her surviving children are ex-Mayor Belknap, City Clerk Belknap, ex-Senator Belknap, of Granville, Mrs. C. H. Schaffer, of Onota, Mich., Mrs. A. E. Stockwell, Thomas R. and Herbert P. Belknap, of this city. PETER WEIRICH. April 2, 1887, at noon, Peter Weirich, long identified with the brewing and other business interests of the West Side, died at his home on West Bridge street. Mr. Weirich had been sick nearly three months, an attack of pneumonia developing into a quick consumption against which even his powerful frame and great vitality could make but little resistance. He was born in the village of Todtenorth, near Coblentz, in Prussia, Jan. 18, 1831, and was consequently 56 years of age at the time of his death. The year that he attained his majority he came to America to seek his fortune, with the sole capital of his hands and brains, first going to Milwaukee, but within a year applying for and receiving employment at the brewery of Christopher Kusterer in this city. Within two years (in 1855) he purchased the property where the Michigan brewery now stands and went into business for himself. The next year he married Josephine' Arnold, of Austria, who died 12 years ago. Mr. Weirich prospered in business and became identified with the business advancement of the West Side to a considerable extent; he owned several business blocks and was a director in the Fifth national bank in the organization of which he was prominent. The eighth ward elected him to the council for several terms and found him an active and influential representative.

Of a family of 10 children, but five are now living, a young son, Henry, and four daughters. Two sisters of Mr. Weirich, Mrs. Brach and Mrs. Lachman, reside here, and there are two in Germany. He was a Mason and a member of the Turn and Arbeiter vereins. His acquaintance and associations were extensive, and by them all he was highly esteemed as a business man, a citizen and a friend.

ANNUAL MEETING, 1887.

Grand Rapids, John Kirkland, recalls to scores of people memories of the early days here. Rarely is one blessed with such general, nay, universal friendship. John Kirkland was born at Saybrook, Conn., in 1807. At the age of seven years he moved, with his father's family, to Bridgewater, Oneida county, N. Y. About 1836 he married Emily Jane Green, a sister of Mrs. Wm. I. Blakely, at West Winfield, Herkimer county, N. Y., and in 1837 came to Michigan, settling in Paris township, and a few years later moved into Grand Rapids, where he made his home for life. By his first wife, who died about 1851, he had one daughter, Martha, now Mrs. Stover, who lives in Wyoming township. About 1854 or 1855 he married Sarah Rauch, by whom he had two children, Dr. Reynold J. and Nellie Kirkland, who also survive him. Mr. Kirkland was by trade a cooper, and that he followed during all his active life in this city, taking great pride in his work, in which he had few if any superiors as a craftsman "working by hand." And whoever entered his shop or his home was sure of a pleasing welcome from as jolly and genial a man as ever breathed; always good humored, always sociable and contented and cheery, and happy, and ready to beat a tattoo as he drove home the hoops on his barrels. For about forty years in religious feeling he leaned to Swedenborgianism, and to the glowing warmth of some portions of the philosophy of modern Spiritualism. In the ripeness of years passes away one who was eminently a pattern of honesty, of thorough uprightness, of neighborly kindness and charity, of whole hearted manliness and unruffled cheerfulness during a long and well spent life. LEONARD D'OOGE. Leonard D'Ooge, who for over 30 years has been closely identified with the growth and business interests of this city, died at his residence on Lafayette street, April 12, 1887, at the ripe old age of 71 years. Leonard D'Ooge was born in the province of Zealand, Netherlands, February 14, 1816, and learned the trade of a painter. He was married in 1838 to Johanna Minters, and nine years after came to America, arriving in New York, October 1, 1847. He brought quite a sum of money with him which he invested in business, but being unable to speak English, he was unfortunate and lost his money. He moved westward and located in Ravenna where ho lived two years. Being destitute of money he served as mail messenger, traveling on foot from Grand Rapids to Muskegon, making trips semi-weekly at $1.25 per trip. In 1857, at the solicitation of Father De Kunick, a Catholic priest, he came to Grand Rapids with his family and painted the new Catholic church on Monroe street, continuing to work at his trade about two

MEMORIAL REPORT-KENT COUNTY. 93 years, when he engaged in mercantile business of a somewhat limited character in a frame building erected by himself on the corner of Monroe and Division streets. He also built a small house and two stores, all of which have been removed and replaced by substantial structures. He leased a large plat of land at $75 per year, and by improving it attracted business to that part of the town at the head of, Monroe street. During the crash of '57 he made an assignment for the benefit of his creditors, but on resuming business liquidated his liabilities dollar for dollar. In 1868 he built a business block on Canal.street, and in 1869 erected a handsome residence on Lafayette street. In 1870 he retired from active business, bought and built other houses in this city, and has since been occupied in the management of the property he had accumulated. Mr. D'Ooge leaves a wife and five children; Martin L., professor of Greek in the state university at.Ann Arbor, who is now at Athens, and Benjamin L., assistant professor of Latin at the same university, Mrs. 'H. Utterwick, Mrs. J. A. S. Verdier and Jennie 0. D'Ooge, who were with him during his last hours. Mr. D'Ooge was an esteemed member of the First Reformed church of this city.

EZRA F. BLOOD. Another venerable pioneer has passed on to his final reward. Ezra F. Blood departed this life on the old homestead farm southeast of Tecumseh, in the mists of early morning on Tuesday, Feb. 15, 1887. His funeral obsequies were attended on Thursday last at the Presbyterian church, where a large concourse of our older residents gathered around his bier to pay the last office of respect to the honored dead. The deceased was born in Hillsboro county, New Hampshire, Oct. 28, 1798. He remained upon his father's farm, a diligent and dutiful son, until he arrived at his majority, when he moved to Jefferson county, New York. There he resided until the spring of 1824, when he joined a party of western fortune hunters, whose destination was Tecumseh. He came with the pioneer party to this section, and on the 22d day of May, 1824, he located the farm which afterwards became his home and where he saw the last of earth. Returning to Monroe-for the balance of the party, he arrived again in Tecumseh on June 2, 1824, with the family of Musgrove Evans and others. The party passed their first night on the oak openings, north of the river Raisin, in Brownville. On that day Tecumseh became his home, and. that, relation remained ever after, until the angel of death cut the bond. From June, 1824, until January 12, 1830, he lived unmarried, improving his farm, erecting buildings, and beautifying and making a home for his bride. On 13

98 ANNUAL MEETING, 1887. that date he married Miss Alzina Blackmar, and they at once began housekeeping in the home which together they made beautiful sand holy for more than fifty seven years. During the early settlement of the country his generous heart and manly hand were ever ready to welcome and assist the new settler, freely giving his time and labor to smooth their rugged pathway, and by aid and kinaness in health and sickness bringing hope and success to many a household. An honest man, a faithful christian, a zealous supporter of education, assisted by his noble and devoted wife, they and their worthy compeers made our town and country what it is, pre-eminent in enterprise and its results, and carved out from the forests the beautiful farms and homes which dot our commonwealth and embellish the landscape like "apples of gold in pictures of silver." The last man of the original party of settlers here, one of the few still left among the pioneers who came prior to 1830, he will be missed everywhere; in his neighbourhood and in our village, where his noble form will be no longer seen in social gatherings and religious meetings; in his church, where for so many years his christian virtues and upright life have been a beacon and example to both old and young; in his family, where his care and affection have been the salace and comfort of his wife and children, and where the example he has given, in his declining days and pious resignation, has enshrined his memory in their hearts; in the minds of many an old resident who has been blessed with his charity and kindness in time of need. Freed from the sufferings of-earth, he has gone to his eternal rest, to receive the reward of his noble deeds, and to hear from that Heavenly Father whom he delighted to worship, this welcome: "Well done, thou good and faithful servant, enter thou into the joy of thy Lord." MfRS. MARANDA DEWEY. Departed this life at her residence in the village of Tecumseh, Feb. 20, 1887. Mrs. M1aranda Dewey, aged seventy two years and eight months, widow of the late L. D. Dawey. Mrs. Dewey's maiden name was Olmsted. She was born in Huron county, Ohio, June 15, 1815. She came with her parents to Detroit in the year 1818. There Mrs. Thomas Sheldon become acquainted with the young and active little girl; with the advice of her husband the child was adopted as one of the family, enjoying all the comforts of friendship of an opulent and cheerful home until eighteen years of age. She remembered very well when five years of age accompaning Hon. Thomas Sheldon and wife on a delightful pleasure trip to Mackinaw, taking passage on the first steamboat that ever came

MEMORIAL REPORT-LENAWEE COUNTY. 99 to Detroit; also the first and only passage the Walk-in-the-water ever made over Lake Huron. In the year 1833 she made the acquaintance of L. D. Dewey, who then was stage agent and general manager of all the mail routes which left Detroit. On the 3d of October she was married to him at the beautiful home residence of Mr. Sheldon on Jefferson avenue, Detroit. In the year 1834, Mr. Dewey and wife moved to his pleasant farm one mile west of Tecumseh village. Here Mrs. Dewey resided fifty three years, and died at her cottage home. She was the mother of six children, all married, and all attended her funeral. She was a member of the Universalist church, a kind and loving mother, a valued neighbor. Her pure character and sweet womanly disposition endeared her to a large circle of acquaintances. Thus one by.one our well remembered, industrious and intelligent pioneers leave us never to return. MRS. MELINDA BAKER. The death of this well known and much respected pioneer of Fairfield, occurred at her home on Monday evening, March 28, 1887. Aunt Melinda, as she was familiarly called, was a mother to all, an honest, conscientious christian woman, and no name will be more missed in the large circle of friends by whom she was known than the one who has gone, and in the event of death it is fitting that something more than a mere passing notice be taken for the memory of her. She was born in Chenango county, N. Y., Aug. 10, 1810, and was married to Orrin Baker in Oct. 1831; settled in Fairfield in June, 1832, and has made this her home ever since that date. Her husband erected the third house that was built in Fairfield and was appointed to the position of post-master of the first postoffice established south of Adrian in Lenawee county. She has been interested in all the movements for the building up of the town, and with her hands has helped to make the pleasant home where she so many years resided and can truly lay claim to the name of pioneer. She held membership with the M. E. church and was active in all of its ordinances until stricken with disease a few months ago, a cancerous trouble which has caused many long months of suffering, but through it all the spirit of patience has been manifested. Thus ends a good life which was full of good acts, and she rests from her labors and her works do follow her. ROBERT BOYD. Robert Boyd died at his home in Tecumseh, Mich., on Wednesday May 4, 1887.

ANNUAL MEETING, 1887.

Mr. Boyd was born in Forthtown, near Claughwater, County Antrim, Ireland, on the 20th of Oct. 1806. When he was 13 he came with his father to America, settling in Groveland, Livingston Co., New York. In 1832 he came to Michigan and on Feb. 2, 1833, he was married to Miss Sarah Richard, of Raisin. His home was in Raisin until 1879, when he gave up the care of his farm and came to Tecumseh, where his remaining years were spent. Mr. Boyd was a person of gentle and retiring nature and the character of his religion was in accord with his natural temperament. It was placid and equable, yet it was strong and decided. Soon after coming to Raisin he united with the Presbyterian church. His life was consistent with his professions, and he inspired all who knew him with his sincerity and his christian faith. To know him was to feel that the benediction of the Savior, "Blessed are the pure in heart for they shall see God," was his. A few uninspired books he read; but after all his one book was the Bible. He was remarkably familiar with its contents and his life was shaped in accordance with its precepts. In trembling hand was recorded at its beginning the date of his last reading of the volume in course, Oct. 20, 1886, and the mark at which he left off was in Ezra. His evening readings were in the new Testament, and he left off in Acts. He frequently asked in his sickness, to have the 103d Psalm read to him, and would repeat it in low voice along with the reader. He was liberal in his benefactions and charitable in his judgments of others. His place in the sanctuary was always filled when he was able to be present, and his form was seen and his voice was heard with equal regularity in the weekly prayer meeting. Two years ago his wife, a noble hearted christian, was called suddenly away. Now they both have left us and are entered into rest. "The memory of the just is blessed." MARQUETTE COUNTY. BY PETER WHITE. EDWARD BREITUNG. HIon. Edward Breitung, of Negaunee, died at his winter residence in Eastman, Ga., about 12 o'clock Thursday night, March 3, 1887, after a lingering and painful illness of some three weeks' duration. The immediate cause of his demise was an attack of pneumonia. Mr. Breitung went to Chicago early in the December previous, intending to return before proceeding to

his wintering place in Georgia. Business prevented him from returning from Chicago as he had intended, and he was joined there by his family on the 3d of February with a view to having them at once start with him for Georgia. Before this purpose could be put in execution, Mr. Breitung was prostrated by the attack which finally resulted in his death, and remained for several days at his hotel in a critical condition. Some improvement taking place, on the 11th of the same mouth he, with his family, left for Eastman in a special car, this step being taken by the advice of his physicians. For a few days after his arrival he was somewhat better, but afterward steadily continued to grow worse, until death at last brought him rest and peace. His wife and son, his private secretary, Mr. F. E. Pearse, and also Miss Lizzie Merry and Prof. A. J. Tourville, were in Eastman with him when the end came. When the news reached Negaunee it created a profound impression and threw the entire community into mourning at the loss of one of its most influential, liberal and most highly esteemed citizens. The Breitung house, named after the deceased, was heavily draped in respect to his memory. By order of Acting Mayor Hoch the city flag was also draped and suspended across Iron street. Edward Breitung was born in the city of Schalkau, in the Duchy of SaxeMeiningen, Germany, November 10, 1831, and was, consequently, 56 years of age at the time of his decease. After going through his preparatory course, he entered the college of Meiningen, in Meiningen, and graduated in 1849. After completing his education, and during the same year, he emigrated to this country, coming to this state and locating in Kalamazoo. Two years later he moved to Detroit, where he remained four years. "In May, 1855, he came to Lake Superior, located in Marquette, and engaged in the mercantile business. Soon after this he commenced exploring and buying and selling mineral lands. He remained in Marquette for four years and in 1859 came to Negaunee, where he afterwards resided. Here he engaged in the mercantile business and also associated himself with Israel B. Case, and they ran the Pioneer furnace under contract. In 1864 he sold out his mercantile business and gave his entire attention to mining and mining interests. During the winter of 1864-'65 he began to open up and develop the Washington mine and in 1870 he began to open up the Negaunee hematite range. No one believed he would find merchantable ore there, and all thought the venture a foolish one. But he had confidence in his own judgment, and future developments have fully proved that it was sound. In the fall of 1871 he began to develop the famous Republic mine, the largest and most profitable 1. /

102 ANNUAL MEETING, 1887. iron mine in this country, if not in the world. In 1863 he commenced explorations on the Menominee range and continued them for three years. Here again everybody believed that he had embarked in a profitless venture, but, as before, the issue verified the correctness of his opinion. The immense amount of ore taken out of the mines on that range fully justifies the faith he had in that section of the Lake Superior iron field. In 1882 and 1883 he became interested in the Vermillion iron range, in Minnesota, where once again the investment that he made proved highly profitable. Mr. Breitung was one of the pioneers in the Lake Superior mining industry. His capital consisted only of ability, enterprise and determination when he began life, but by the constant exercise of these qualities, coupled with the good judgment which characterized all his operations, he became a capitalist, and was one of the most prominent and successful operators in mineral lands in the Lake Superior iron region. The deceased held many positions of trust in the village and city government of Negaunee. He was mayor of the city in 1880, 1882 and 1883, besides holding less important positions. He was elected a member of the house of representatives from Marquette county for the term of 1873-'74, but resigned in 1873. He was elected a state senator from the thirty second district for the term of 1877-'78. He was elected to the forty eighth congress from this district by a large majority, in 1883, and served his term out, declining a renomination at its close. In politics he was an ardent republican, and was for years the acknowledged leader of his party in this section. Mr. Breitung was united in marriage November 28, 1870, to Miss Mary Pauline, of Port Washington. A son, Edward N., born November 1, 1871, survives him, and another son, William M., was lost in infancy. In life Mr. Breitung was noted for his liberality, and his generous readiness to aid every worthy object, and in death he will be long and sincerely mourned by the community in which so many years of his life were passed, and for which he did so much by kindly deeds and wholesome example. MONTCALM COUNTY. BY I. P. SHOEMAKER. MORTON SHEARER. Died, at his residence in Greenville, on Sunday evening, October 11, 1885, Morton Shearer, one of the pioneers of Montcalm county.



Page 103
MEMORIAL REPORT-MONTCALM COUNTY.

103

The deceased was born at Palmer, Massachusetts, Nov. 26, 1811. Leaving his native state, he resided for a time in the state of New York, where he was married to Elizabeth Westfield, on the 5th day of September, 1833. He removed to St. Clair county, in this state, at an early day, and arrived in Greenville on the 7th of May, 1849. In the early part of 1850 Mr. Shearer built a hotel upon the ground now occupied by the Exchange hotel in Greenville, which was the first public house erected in the county, and was, for several years, the proprietor and lahdlord of this house, which was known throughout the county as the Shearer house. The residence now occupied by the Hion. 0. F. Morgan, mayor of the city, was built by Mr. Shearer in 1853. In the earlier days of the county Mr. Shearer took a prominent part in public affairs, being for more than ten years one of the superintendents of the poor, and holding the office of judge of probate from 1855 to 1857. He was a member.of the Masonic fraternity before he came to Greenville,. and was one of the charter members of the Blue Lodge of that city, and afterward one of the prominent members of the Greenville chapter. The latter years of his life he was a farmer and veterinary surgeon; which last occupation he followed at the time of his death. The funeral services were conducted at his late residence, October 13, 1885, by the Rev. J. L. Patton. The exercises at the grave were conducted by the Masonic fraternity, to which he was greatly attached. The writer of this obituary knew the deceased for nearly a quarter of a century, and can say that it was the universal testimony of his neighbors, that he was a truly upright man, his word being as good as his bond. His associates in office speak of him as a man of excellent judgment, and true integrity in carrying on public business. Mrs.,L. E. Backus, Mrs. Maria Savage, and James M. Shearer, all of this city, are the only surviving members of the family of the deceased. MANNING RUTAN. Died, in the city of Greenville, December 9, 1886, Manning Rutan, one of the pioneers of Montcalm county, and a member of this society. Mr. Rutan was born at New Providence, Sussex county, N. J., September 25, 1802, and consequently was, at the time of his death, a little more than 84 years of age. His father dying when he was quite young, his support and early training devolved upon his mother, who was an admirabl6 woman. After serving an apprenticeship in a country store, the deceased commenced business for himself in New Jersey, in which he was successful.



Page 104
104,ANNUAL MEETING, 1887.

Leaving New Jersey in the month of October, 1851, he came to Montcalm county, and purchased a large tract of land south of Flat River, and east of Lafayette street, which he subsequently platted, and sold as village lots. And, although he kept a general store in Greenville, the greater portion of his estate was made in real estate transactions. About the year 1870 he turned his mercantile business over to his son, and was never, subsequent to that time, what might be termed a business man, although he was engaged in many business ventures, in which he continued until near the time of his death. Mr. Rutan was an energetic, active and intelligent business man; he never let a matter of business pass through his hands until he understood it in all its bearings, and few persons excelled him in accuracy in business transactions. He was quick to acknowledge a mistake, and ever ready to correct. any error that he might have made. He will be long remembered for his benevolences. While he has been extolled for endowing a professorship at Olivet, yet I think he took greater satisfaction in making donations that were never known to the public. Among these was a donation of something more than fifteen hundred dollars, which he made a few years ago to Henry M. Moore, one of the pioneers of Greenville, and with whom many of those present were acquainted years ago. The writer of this obituary has been more impressed with some of the little kindnesses which he has known Mr. Rutan to perform, than with all those deeds of charity which have been known to the public, and by which the public has estimated his character. Mr. Rutan was a man of sound sense, had not a shadow of ostentation in his make up, and never boasted of his wealth, either directly or indirectly. In short, he tried to do those things of which God woull approve. He did his work well and wisely, and sought his chief happiness in the path of duty. SAMUEL G. HUTCHINS. Samuel G. Hutchins died suddenly Sunday afternoon, May 15, 1887, of rheumatism of the heart, in his 68th year. Only a short time before he had been in the garden.

ANNUAL MEETING, 1887.

JOHN G CROMBIE. John G. Crombie of Pontiac died very suddenly, of heart disease, while sitting in his chair, Jan. 11, 1887. John G. Crombie was born of distinguished parentage at North Hartland, Windsor county, Vt., Jan., 12, 1820, and had he lived but another day, would have been just 67 years of age. He had been three times married; first to Sarah Tower, Aug. 24, 1848; second, to Sarah Harding, Feb. 10, 1853; and to Rebecca Runnion, who survives him, Nov. 21, 1860. Of five children, two are dead. Mr. Crombie spent two years'in Dartmouth College, and was a man of much more than ordinary intelligence. He settled in Pontiac in 1842, since which time he had become permanently identified in business circles. He first entered the employ of Lull & Draper, as clerk, with whom he remained two years. He afterwards entered the cabinet shop of his uncle, Col. Page, and two years later, upon his.uncle's death, succeeded to his business. He subsequently entered into a copartnership with Danforth Petty, doing business in the Crofoot Block (so called); afterwards becoming sole proprietor, he removed to the Waverly house, from thence to the present location. He had also in connection with his store and undertaking business a manufactory on Lawrence street west, which at' an early day formed no inconsiderable feature of Pontiac's business enterprises. Probably very few men in his line have enjoyed a more extended local reputation that Mr. Crombie. In an early day nearly all the furniture he sold, as well as the coffins and caskets, were of his own manufacture. He was a man of strong convictions, positive ideas, and an uncompromising adherent to the principles of the republican party. It can truthfully be said of him he was an honest man. At his death he was a member of the Congregational church. He was a prominent member of the order of Odd Fellowship, being a charter member of Pontiac Lodge, No. 3. Thus has passed away another of Pontiac's most distinctive landmarks, whose business integrity as well as his political convictions, have been forced into and have become a part of the city's life. MRS. MARY ADDIS. Died, in Independence, January 21, 1887, of paralysis, Mrs. Mary, relict of Peter Addis, aged 71 years, 2 months and 6 days. She had been a resident of Clarkston for nearly 50 years.

E. church at Pontiac, in 1855, he was converted, joined that church, and has -ever been a consistent and honored member during the thirty two years of his christian life. The ranks of the early pioneers of the county are being deci mated from year to year, and soon there will be none left to answer the roll call; but their work's will remain and endure until the end of time. JOHN K. DEWEY. John K. Dewey died April 12, 1887, at the residence of his son, Chas. E. Dewey, at Four Towns. Deceased was born in Royalton, Windsor county, Vermont, Feb. 28, 1795. He moved to New York state with the man to whom he was apprenticed at the carpenter and joiner trade, and on Nov. 23, 1819, was married to Harriet Hunt, whose death occurred Aug. 20, 1863. He moved to Michigan in 1831, and settled in Waterford township, where he has since resided. He was made a F. & A. Mason in New York in 1818, and was an honorary member of Birmingham Lodgemat the time of his death, and of which lodge he was also a charter member. JAMES SKIDMORE. James Skidmore, an old and much respected resident of Troy, died at his home Nov. 23, 1886, at the advanced age of about 89 years.

ANNUAL MEETING, 1887.

The deceased was born in Ulster county, New York, March 9, 1798. He came to Michigan with two brothers, who afterwards returned, in 1823, locating the farm upon which he died, having been the continuous owner of the same farm for 63 years. After locating his land he returned to Ulster county, where he was married the same year, 1823, to Miss Philanda Beach. They lived together 49 years, when she died in the spring of 1873, aged 72. We add a brief personal experience of this old pioneer, as published in the Pontiac Gazette Feb. 27, 1874. "I took up a farm, upon which I now live, of 80 acres, in the township of Troy. Shortly after I went back to New York, where I was married to Miss Philanda Beach, with whom I shared the pleasures and sorrows of life until last NMarch, when she was taken from us, to a better land, I trust, in her 72d year, It is needless for me to give an account of all the incidents of pioneer life with which I am familiar, it would only be repeating the same old story of toil and hard time. Suffice it to say that no one can realize what pioneer life is until they have expbrienced it, until they have left their home and friends, and gone into the wild forest, constructed for themselves a dwelling from the sturdy oak, and manufactured for themselves furniture from the saplings of the surrounding forest. When I first moved upon my farm I had nothing but good health and strong muscles to support myself and family, but by hard work and strict economy, I managed to buy a cow the first summer for eleven dollars. I also raised two acres of corn upon Mr. Satterlee's farm, the same summer, and I often sat down to a meal prepared from the productions of that cornfield and our limited dairy, which, in those days, I thought was good enough for any man. After we hpd been upon our farm about three years we had the misfortune to lose our house by fire, one cold January night, as we were visiting Mr. Alanson Goodrich's, with James Bailey and their families. But my neighbors, showing the true pioneer spirit, helped me to build a new house, which was completed in a week; they also contributed household goods and provisions enough to enable us to keep house for the remainder of the, winter. I have in my house to-day some of the dishes given to me upon this occasion." JOHN MARTIN. " Rev. John Martin died at his residence in Ovid, Clinton county, Michigan, Feb. 4, 1887, aged 89 years. Rev. John Martin was born in Cayuga county, New York, in 1797. Trained by parents who needed his earlier services, at the age of thirteen he

set out from home, having one suit of -clothes, his sole earthly possession. Following the year 1817, which marked the beginning of his christian experience, a devout and energetic spirit bore him up during many seasons of privation and hardship. In the next year he was married to the one who, for more than 50 years, has stood faithfully by his side through all that life hath brought him. To meet the imperative needs of a rapidly growing family of six children, in 1831 he sold his possessions in New York state, and, on the 2d of August, set out for the territory of Michigan. After a three weeks' journey they settled in the township of Troy, Oakland county, having just $2 left (after paying traveling expenses) for a cow and a few acres of land. At that time, as the deceased has often said, the ground nowcovered by Detroit was occupied only by French farms and a few post traders' huts. When Father Martin first settled there were only 27 ministers of all denominations in the territory, himself being the only one in his county. He at once gave all his spare time to the work of the Gospel, and so continued until 1846, when failing health compelled his release from public labor. The largest annual salary that he ever received was $70. During that year he attended 24 covenant meetings, broke bread as many times, baptized, visited, addressed a Sunday school once in two weeks, attended 4 ministerial conferences, 4 councils, 1 association; preached in 22 school houses, 14 dwelling houses, 2 meeting houses and one grist mill. In performing this labor he traveled 1,500 miles on foot and horseback. As a fitting close of a life of 90 years so full of good works, he goes to his rest in peace, firmly trusting that 'He is faithful that promised."' The subject of the above notice from the Ovid Register and Union was one of the earliest and best known settlers in Clinton county. He was not a cultured.preacher, but a practical minister, with words and advice suited to the times and the field he worked in. His temperament and social nature peculiarly fitted him for the pioneer work he followed so devotedly. He was one of old Ben Franklin's kind of men, whistled while he worked, was always happy himself, and his cheerful nature was an inspiration in every log cabin he entered. In every pioneer home Elder John Martin was welcome, and the altar fires in every family with whom he tabernacled for a night were brightened by his coming. Measuring his reward by the sacrifices made, there are many jewels in the crown of his rejoicing. COL. JOHN P. FOSTER. The death of John P. Foster, November 5, 1886, was an anticipated event.

ANNUAL MEETING, 1887.

His sickness being caused by Bright's disease his death waB considered certain at a not very remote day, and the family and friends were in a measure prepared for the summons; none more so than himself, who talked of his departure and planned for his funeral as he would transact a matter of business. In all matters pertaining to the welfare and growth of Pontiac Mr. Foster always put his shoulder to the wheel of progress, doing his full share in the advancement of the material interests of the city. His active and earnest efforts in public affairs led to his political preferment and he served as alderman one term, was township treasurer several years when the duties of the office extended over the city, was several times elected ward treasurer, was also constable for a number of terms, and deputy sheriff under one or more administrations. His pet interest in the city government was the fire department, which he patronized and served during his entire residence in the city, having been its head and chief some 27 years, resigning last season on account of poor health. To this department he devoted special attention, was its head in the change from the volunteer to a paid department, and in the organization of the present force, in the purchase of steam and other apparatus ho was the leading spirit and manager, and may be considered the founder of the present efficient department. He always possessed the confidence of the firemen and in emergencies his orders were promptly obeyed and executed. In his death the boys feel they have lost their best friend and ablest adviser and leader. He was a prominent and respected member of all the Masonic bodies in the city, and had been anointed in the order of high priesthood. In the local orders he had filled the offices of master of the lodge, high priest of the royal arch chapter, and eminent commander of Pontiac Commaudery. From the tessellated pavement to the temple he was an active and earnest worker, attached to the order and its principles. He was also an Odd Follow, but in late years had not been in intimate affiliation. In 1861 he enrolled himself in the 14th Michigan infantry Co. I, with the commission of first lieutenant under Cols. Shoemaker and Robert W. Davis. After an organization and brief camp in Ypsilanti, the regiment joined the department of the Tennessee. After a few months spent in active service he was taken sick, resigned and came home. From this time to the day of his death he never recovered from the seeds of disease engendered by climate change and exposure. Mr. Foster was born in the county of Kent, England, January 1, 1826, making his age nearly 61 years. When a child of about two years his parents emigrated to America, stopping at Utica, New York, when they came to Michigan and Oakland county, where the father, Horatio, located 40 acres of land in Independence. From the humble log house home with all its

embarrassments and privations he began his limited schooling in the old pinery school house which.his father built near the village of Clarkston. At the age of 16 years he entered the shoe shop of William Blake, as an apprentice, working a couple of years, when he changed his occupation to that of carpenter, working for his elder brothers, Samuel and Frederick. He remained with them two years, when he went to Detroit and entered a joiner's shop for instruction in the fine arts of the trade. He remained in Detroit a year when he came to Pontiac in the fall of 1849, entering the employ of Samuel Brotherton, the leading builder in the village of Pontiac. He was married in Detroit, October 24, 1850, to Delia E. Whitman, who survives him. From 1849, except when absent in the army, he lived continuously in Pontiac until his death. At the time of his decease his death was the first in the family, making the loss one of inexperienced family grief, increasing the weight of sorrow and mourning. The deceased leaves a widow and four adult children, three daughters and one son. He leaves one brother, Frederick Foster, of Springfield, the only surviving member of the elder Foster family. By care and industry he accumulated sufficient of this world's goods for the support of his widow and dependent children. HON. WILLIAM AXFORD. The Hon. Wm. Axford, one of the earliest settlers of eastern Michigan, and in an early day one of the most prominent business men in northern Oakland, died at his late home in Olarkston, Thursday morning, September 16, 1886, -after a lingering illness of Bright's disease, with paralysis as the immediate cause of his death. The deceased was born in Windon, Ontario, March 28, 1813. He came to Michigan and to Macomb county in 1822 at the age of nine years, settling with his parents about three miles east of the now village of Rochester. In his young manhood he taught school for a short time, afterwards going into mercantile trade in the town of Avon. In 1842 he located as a merchant in Clarkston, doing a successful business for some 25 years, when he retired from active life, in order to look after his landed estate which was quite large. During his residence in Independence he was supervisor for several terms, and for several terms chairman of the county board. He represented Oakland county in the legislature of 1849, and was a member of the constitutional convention of 1850, a body which formed our present organic law. He was married in 1844 to Ellen 0. Axford, of Oxford, Warren county, New Jersey, with whom he lived until his death.

He had no children, but leaves many more remote relatives, his nearest of living kin being Livingston Axford, Esq., of Holly. He was a man who impressed himself on a community; possessing the elements of leadership, which at times were strongly manifested, to a degree of dictation. It was not easy for him to love his enemies, but to those he liked he was a true, sacrificing friend; one who would protect and defend with his substance those to whom he was socially and in business attached. He was a clear headed man in the performance of public duties, and in his own affairs his books were always honestly balanced. He was always ready to render to every man his due, and was rigid in a like demand from those indebted to him. Right wrongs no one, and he dies free from the stain of demanding more than his own. He was a man of strong convictions on all social and political questions. Politically he affiliated with and was attached to the old school democratic party, whose traditions and principles he clung to asan inherited political treasure, which he never. parted with, or made political traffic of. Socially his fellowship did not cover a wide range; he was devotedly attached to home and locality, in the latter years of his life seldom leaving the home hearth, or aberrating from the beaten local trail of association. He was intimately identified with the growth of Clarkston, and did much in a substantial and advisory way to advance the material interests of the village. * Six nephews, all Axfords, were, at the request of the deceased, selected as his pall bearers. HON. CHARLES H. PALMER. The end of a great life of mental struggle was reached, when our fellow citizen, Charles Henry Palmer, turned upon his side Saturday morning, April 9, 1887, and passed away. When he added three years to the alloted three score and ten, his prospects for many years of vigorous, healthy life, and absolute freedom from the anxieties attending finance and business, were at their very zenith; but alas, when prepared to live, the seeds of disease, long hidden, germinated and hedged him around with difficulties unknown to his before unconquerable will, and he waged the unequal contest with courage and determination. For several hours previous to his death he was painless, and greatly encouraged, and talked cheerfully of future plans for travel and enjoyment, and from those cheerful anticipations he tttrned in bed and was dead. Mr. Palmer was born in Lenox, N. Y., in 1814, graduated from Union Oollege, N. Y., in 1837, became principal of the Fredonia (N. Y.) Academy soon after graduating, and was afterwards principal of Geneseo Academy.

In 1839 he was united in marriage with Miss Betsey A. Cowles, a highly educated and accomplished lady and teacher, who survives him. His parents having removed to Michigan in 1835, he naturally followed to the new state, and became principal of Romeo Academy in 1847. In those years the numerous academies were the nurseries of the colleges and universities, and furnished the educated men of the land. At the head of various institutions of this kind Mr. Palmer ranked among the most accomplished educators of his time, and the Romeo Academy was at the head of the academical institutions of the state. The rich, intellectual fruit of his training is found to-day among the brightest intellects of this and other states. In 1851 he was elected one of the regents of the University of Michigan, and was soon recognized as the leader and best equipped member of the board. He was ardently devoted to the upbuilding of that institution, and threw his whole energy into the work of its reorganization and the perfecting of measures looking to the making it the great institution of learning which it has since become. He was made corresponding secretary of the board, and through his untiring efforts and in the face of great difficulties, the celebrated Dr. Tappan, the patron saint of the University, was secured as its president. The wisdom of Mr. Palmer's choice has since been demonstrated in a thousand ways, but in no direction more apparent than in placing the institution upon a substantial educational basis. Mr. Palmer's temperament called for a more active and remunerative field 'of operations, and in 1853 he settled his family in Pontiac, as a permanent home, and in 1854 went to Lake Superior and immediately entered a career -of mining development and speculation, in which he continued till near the close of his life, experiencing all the ups and downs of the mining business, but persevering against odds at times which would overwhelm most men. He first opened and managed as one of the owners the Pewabic copper mine, the first successful venture of the kind in the now famous Portage Lake,district. He was one.of the incorporators of the Franklin mine in 1857, South Pewabic mine in 1865, the Ossipee, now Oscoda mine, in 1867, and the Kearsage mine the same year. In 1869 he purchased the celebrated PalmerLoring tract, adjoining the Calumet and liecla property, and out of the attempt of Loring and a Boston party to defraud Mr. Palmer of his rights in this purchase by the freeze-out process, arose the great suit to maintain his claim, which went toand was last fall decided in his favor by the United States Supreme Court, and which suit for the last dozen years absorbed all the intense mental and physical activity of the man. By this decision his old age was crowned with affluence, a transfer from darkness to the broad sunlight of prosperity, and he greeted the decision with a satisfaction unspeakable. 16

ANNUAL MEETING, 1887.

Also, in 1856 he was one of the chief promoters and corporators of the Portage Lake and River Improvement Company, connecting Portage Lake with Lake Superior by canal. In 1870, in connection with W. N. Walker, George Jerome and S. L. Smith, the Houghton & Ontonagon railroad was incorporated, built 30 miles of road from Champion to L'Anse, bought the Marquette & Ontonagon road, and formed the present M. H. & 0. railroad company, and was the chief promoter in several other large enterprises of a similar character. Since 1875 he has resided almost entirely at his home in Pontiac, engaged in the prosecution of his suit mainly, but always wide awake to surroundings, and aided materially in securing the asylum for this city, of which he was one of the early trustees; he also took a warm interest in the Michigan military academy of which he was trustee; also a vestryman of Zion Episcopal church from 1861 to 1877, except the year 1872. Charles H. Palmer was a broad gauge man, of fine culture, great capabity for organization and business, splendid physique and perfect address. His perceptions were keen and quick, and his power of analyzation was -remarkable. He leaves besides his widow, two daughters, Mrs. Virginia Louise Pickman, of Dillon, Montana, Miss Philomela C., residing at home, Charles H.. Palmer, of Lake Superior, and Clarence A., of Toledo. JOHN H. SMITH. John H. Smith died at his residence in Novi, on Wednesday, May 4, 1887,. aged 67 years. The deceased was born in Bristol, Ontario county, N. Y., March 23, 1820.. At ten years of age lie came with his parents to the territory of Michigan, and settled upon the farm where he died, and upon which he has resided 57 years. He was the youngest of eight children, two of whom pre still living. The deceased had a very wide circle of friends and acquaintances, and themanly form and genial face of "John H.," as he was called far and near, will be sadly missed by the many who have known and esteemed him as an. upright, honorable and influential neighbor, citizen and friend. This will be especially true with the Masonic fraternity, of which he hasbeen long a prominent and active member. As he always desired to exemplify the character of a true man and citizen, so did he fhat of a true Mason. Mr. Smith had been much of the time in poor health for several years, but. his death was very sudden and unexpected. In attempting to walk out a little to give directions about some work he wished to have done, he had gone but a few steps from his door when he sank to the earth and immediately

expired. Although he spoke not at the time, he had often conversed freely upon the subject of his decease, especially during a severe illness in 1882. The writer well remembers his calm resignation in view of what was then believed to be imminent death, and the unfaltering trust manifested by him in that hour of his extremity. Death seemed to have no terror to him. He died as he had lived, a man who acted in obedience to his own convictions, regardless of results. A wife and three daughters mourn the loss of a kind, devoted husband and loving father. Their bereavement is sore indeed, and they have the heartfelt sympathy of those who know their great affliction. HON. JAMES BAYLEY. James Bayley, one of the earliest pioneers of Troy, Oakland county, passed quietly away about 8:30 p. m., on Sunday, May 1, 1887, at his late residence in Birmingham. He was born in Scipio, Oayuga county, New York, July 7, 1802, and was at the time of his death eighty four years, nine months and twenty four days old. His father, Isaac Bayley, and his mother, were from Windsor county, Vermont, and settled in Scipio, where his father died when the subject of this notice was four years old. At the age of twelve he was given his clothes and began life for himself. At first he engaged in the manufacture of harness and saddlery; at fourteen to eighteen at the tanning and currier business, for which labor during these years he received his board, clothes and instructions in those trades. During the next three years he was enabled to lay by from his earnings a sum sufficient to come to Michigan in April, 1824, to buy lands for a homestead. After viewing lands in several townships in Oakland county he. located the east half of the southwest quarter and the west half of the southeast quarter of section 21, town 2 north, range 11 east, on May 10, 1824, and returned to New York. On January 20, 1825, he married Miss Dorcas Pearsall, daughter of Michael Pearsall, of his native town, with whom he lived sixty two years, three months and eleven days, and who still survives him. Of those who were present at their wedding, there are- still 'living Mrs. Betsey Alexander, Mrs. Philbrick, sisters, and Henry and Sherman Pearsall, brothers of Mrs. Bayley, and Benj. Daniels. Of these Mrs. Alexander and Mr. Daniels were present at the funeral. His early education was obtained at the district schools of those early days; yet with the advantages of a private library to which he had access, and by observation, associations and experiences, few men of his ad.ntages were better informed of public men, measures and affairs of the state and nation than he. In April, 1825, with 'his wife, he bade farewell to relatives and

friends in his native town, and came to Michigan, settling early in May upon those lands he had purchased from the government the year, previous. Mr. and Mrs. Bayley have had six children born to them; one son at the age of twenty one was drowned, two infant twins, a son and daughter, died when nearly two years old. Two sons, Volney and Adams, and one daughter, Clarissa, Mrs. William Dennison, are still living. In 1830 he was induced by Phineas Davis, of Detroit, to remove there and take charge of a tannery and currier establishment, which he conducted with marked ability about three years, iwhen he returned to his farm and commenced with renewed energy to improve it, until he had the satisfaction df receiving from his brother farmers the unqualified commendation of having one of the best appointed and cultivated farms in the county. Mr. Bayley has been president of the Oakland county and State Agricultural societies, member of many of their committees, an influential and prominent member of those societies, to whom he gave his counsel and material aid in their infancy, continuing the same until he relinquished his active farm life. He became a member of the Baptist society in Troy in 1837. His parents before him were zealous Baptists, and the son walking in the steps of the parents, became a consistent, active and influential member of the society. At the spring election in 1839 he was elected supervisor, in 1849 justice of the peace, in 1864 to the house of representatives; in 1860 he was appointed farm superintendent of the State Agricultural College at Lansing, which office he held for three years with credit to himself and material profit to the institution' and state. Finding the perplexities and arduous duties were taxing him excessively, and his health failing, he resigned his position and returned once more to his farm in Troy in February, 1863, where he remained until 1868, when he purchased a residence in Birmingham where he removed and resided until his death. These very early pioneers of the county and state are rapidly passing away. They silently drop out of the line and soon no land marks will remain to remind us of those whose brain and muscle felled the forests, built our schools, churches, public improvements, etc., etc., and made it possible to sustain the present population of this beautiful peninsula state. CAPT. WILLIAM ALBERTSON. Capt. William Albertson, of Pontiac, an early pioneer, a highly respected and honored citizen, died after many years' illness, of consumption, at the home of his son, W. S. Albertson, on Feb. 4, 1887. The deceased was born near Sing Sing, New York, November 27, 1811. He was married to Rebecca, eldest daughter of Rev. C. F. Frey, at New York

city, July 19, 1836. They moved to Michigan in November of 1844, and for six months sojourned at Elizabeth Lake, this county, with the late Almeron Whitehead, when they became residents of Pontiac. Mr. Albertson first entered the store of Peck & Standish, and up to the outbreak of the rebellion had been honored with various offices of public trust, such as village marshal, treasurer, constable and deputy sheriff during the administration of Clark Beardsley, and again in later years under Sheriff Wixon, and also for a time served acceptably as Assistant U. S. Revenue Assessor. He took an active part in the organization of the 22d Michigan Infantry, and received the commission of 2d lieutenant of Co. A, which he was largely instrumental in raising. He remained with the regiment till the close of the war. He was a good soldier, efficient in the discharge of his duties, having had for several months the entire charge of the regiment, and serving also for a time as quartermaster. He received the commission of captain about six months before the close of the war. In whatever capacity he was called upon to serve he was found competent and faithful. At the close of the three years' service he gave in defense of his country, he was mustered out with a constitution weakened by overwork and exposure and health seriously impaired. He never regained his wonted vigor. In 1883 he wintered in California, receiving but temporary benefit, however, frem that salubrious climate. On his return he gradually relapsed into that debilitated condition which, despite the constant, ever watchful care of a devoted companion, and the tender ministrations of loving children, his life ebbed out gradually and as perceptibly as the setting sun sinks below the western horizon, leaving a halo of a well spent life to mark his going. ELIJAH GROW. We are sad to chronicle the death of Elijah Grow, a well to do farmer and an old and esteemed citizen. He was thrown from a buggy Thursday, April 21, with but slight injuries on one side of the head, and died Sunday, April 24, 1887, at half past one. He was one of ten Grow brothers, and twin to Elisha Grow, vho passed away the 4th of March, 1887. They were born in Pomfret, Windom Co., Conn., August 24, 1810; his parents, Elisha and Louisa Grow, moved from Pomfret to Homer, Cortland Co., N. Y., in 1812; in 1831 he experienced religion and was of the Baptist faith; was married to Charity Baker, in Homer, Jan. 19, 1833, she passing away May 6, 1885.

there only till 1856, when they bought a farm in Waterford Center, Michigan. In 1858 they became spiritualists and remained such until they passed into a higher plane of progression. In 1866 they sold in Waterford and bought a farm in the township of Pontiac, one and a half miles southeast of this city, where he resided at the time of his death. He leaves two children, Irving K. Grow, residing on the homestead, and Mrs. H. P. Merrill, of Bay City, besides a large circle of relatives and friends to mourn his loss. He was a good man and respected by all who knew him. ELISHA GROW. Elisha Grow was born in Ponfret, Windom Co., Conn., Aug. 24, 1810. His parents removed to Homer, Cortland Co., N. Y., in 1812. In 1833 they came to Michigan and settled in Springfield.

JAMES LEWIS. James Lewis, one of our well known and respected citizens, died peacefully at the family residence, 707 South Washington avenue, Jan. 30, 1887. Mr. Lewis had for several years suffered from a complication of diseases culminating in an affection of the spine, and during the winter was confined to the house. * Mr. Lewis was born in Akron, Erie county, N. Y., in 1822, and came to Detroit, Mich., thirty six years ago, removing after seven years' residence in that city to East Saginaw, where he has since made his abode. His occupation was that of a builder, and when he came here he associated himself with W. H. Glasby in a sash and blind factory. After that was burned down he engaged in business of various kinds, being, best known in that of moving houses, safes, etc,;. also purchasing a good deal of real estate. Mr Lewis has always been regarded as an honorable business man and a good citizen. Shortly before his death, which he felt was but a question of a few hours, he -expressed a wish to his wife that his friends should know he died happily, believing in and receiving all the consolations of religion. He leaves a wife and one daughter, Mrs. Harry Hamilton, to mourn his loss. His only sister, -Mrs. S. R., Clark, of Byron, this state, was present during his final sickness. DAVID D. ROSS. At ten o'clock on the morning of March 22, 1887, David D. Ross, father *of County Treasurer Arthur Ross, and a pioneer of Saginaw county, died at his home in Taymouth, where he had lived since 1844, of old age. The -deceased was born in Aberdeen, Scotland, in 1805. He came to this country in 1843, and in 1844 located on a farm in Taymouth, where he has since lived.

ANNUAL MEETING, 1887.

Michael, Mrs. Mary Jeffers laid down the burden of her life at the advanced age of 86 years. Mrs. Jeffers was born near Moville, Ireland, April 11, 1801. She came to East Saginaw in 1855 and, since that time, has been identified with the interests of the city in various ways. She was a good mother, a warm friend, and a devoted christian woman. She was of a kind disposition, generous impulses, and was ever ready to overlook the faults of others. These traits endeared her to a large circle of friends. Six children survive her. MRS. ESTABROOK. Helen Norris, the beloved wife of Hon. John S. Estabrook, died at her late residence, 1,647 South Washington avenue, East Saginaw, on Sunday evening, April 17, 1887, aged 56 years. The deceased was a noble woman, and during her twenty two years' residence in the city she has been noted for her kindness of heart, her upright christian character, and her many good offices. of love and charity. Her life was gentle yet active, and in its various duties as wife and mother, as a conscientious and earnest christian, as a doer of good among her friends and neighbors, as a laborer in the cause of humanity, she exemplified the dignity, the nobility and the usefulness of exalted womanhood. Those who knew her loved her, and her reputation among all classes of citizens was such that in death many will mourn a good friend and a kindly sympathizer. She leaves a husband and three children to mourn her loss, and many hearts will go out in sympathy to the bereaved family. Mrs. Estabrook came to East Saginaw from Ypsilanti in 1865, which was the home of her girlhood. Her health was not good for some months previous to her death, being a sufferer from brain affection, and a few weeks before her death she was suddenly prostrated by what was said to be softening of the brain. From this attack she never recovered, and her spirit passed from the mortal to the immortal. SHIAWASSEE COUNTY. BY ALONZO H. OWENS. ELIAs COMSTOCK, of Owosso, died October 23, 1886.

WILLIAM H. CROSS. William H. Cross died at the family residence in Centreville, Wednesday evening, September 29, 1886, in his 80th year, having been born in Sullivan county, New York, March 6, 1807. Judge Cross was an early settler in Michigan territory, having come to the territory in 1826. When but a boy of 19 years, he, with his brother Robert, who was also a mere boy, took up their habitation in the woods in Lenawee county on the bank of the river Raisin; here they kept bachelor's hall for a time, having to pack their provisions from Detroit. After a time they sold their farm in Lenawee and came to where Coldwater is now located, entered lands in 1830 and commenced pioneer life anew. Mr. Cross remained single until March, 1832, when he took a helpmeet in the person of Nancy Landon, who survives him after living a happy life of 54 years with him. Mr. Cross has always been a representative man wherever his lot was cast; he was an early merchant in the country; he was in the gold mines of California for several years; was judge of probate of St. Joseph county for 12 years, which office he filled with ability and to the satisfaction of his constituents. He was a man of strong will power but always willing to listen to the teachings of others, and if their views harmonized with his he adopted them; if they did not he acted on his own conviction of right, and when his rulings as judge have been tried in the crucible of high legal talent, his decisions have stood the test. Politically he was a staunch republican, ever faithful, ever true. He has been connected with the Reformed church since his residence in Centreville, over 15 years. In the death of Judge Cross the community have lost a valuable citizen, his children a kind father, his wife a loving husband. He was buried at Sturgis on Saturday, October 2, 1886.

CHARLES A. CHAPIN. When the life career of any citizen who has faithfully and efficiently discharged all the duties imposed upon human existence is closed by death, both the social compact and body politic sustain a loss. In the death of Charles A. Chapin the community, and especially those who knew him best, sensibly. and keenly realize this fact. The best eulogy that can be pronounced upon our departed friend is an uncolored relation of his every day life of which time and space restricts us to a brief epitome only. Mr. Ohapin was a man of a quiet, mild and reserved disposition and was eminently endowed with those qualities both of the head and the heart which endear a person to his friends and the community in which he lives. He was charitable almost to a fault, as many of the recipients of his charity can testify. He was a communicant in the Episcopal church and a man whose daily life exemplified his belief. He did not profess religion as a fashion or a pastime, but as a living reality, a system containing and embodying the true principles of human life and human actions. In all the relations of life he was upright and strictly honest, doing unto others as he would that others would do unto him. He never betrayed a trust or a friend, and when he left this way station in life's endless journey he left behind many, many who will sadly miss him in their daily routine of life. The leisure hours which fell to his lot were profitably redeemed in acquiring sound, useful knowledge, which was evinced by his familiarity with scientific literature and historical research. He was a good listener and a critical 18

observer of the events transpiring around him. He lived up to his belief that man was created to wear out and not rust out, hence he was most unhappy when forced into idleness. Charles A. Chapin, the eldest son of Volney and Chloe (Sloan) Chapin, was born at Ogdensburg, New York, August 1, 1830. He was a lineal descendant of Deacon Samuel Chapin, the progenitor of all who bear the name in this country, and who settled in Springfield, Mass., in 1642. In June, 1833, when Mr. Chapin was three years old, his parents moved from New York to Ann Arbor, so that for fifty three years of his life his home was in that city. It was the desire of his parents that he should receive a liberal education. To that end he prepared for the University. But not fancying any of the professions he changed his course and applied himself to those studies necessary for a business life. Hie availed himself of all the facilities which the institutions of the slate afforded for the most complete commercial education and in 1852 graduated from a commercial college in Detroit. Immediately after finishing his studies he entered upon the stern realitiea and duties of life. His business enterprises were many and varied and to all he applied his abilities with rare assiduity and fidelity. He was an equal partner in the firm of Lund & Chapin in the manufacture of paper in the fifth ward. The firm was formed in 1852 and was subsequently changed to Lund, Chapin & Co., his father having bought an interest therein. This firm built the first paper mill at Geddes. He continued in this business until 1865. He was a large stockholder in the Ann Arbor Salt and Lumber Company in Saginaw county. For a considerable time he was in the employ of Evarts & Ensign, Philadelphia, who were extensively engaged in publishing local histories in the different states. His adaptability for this kind of work earned for him many encomiums from his employers. Prom 1882 to within a few months prior to his death he was a clerk in the pension oflice at Washington. This position he was obliged to leave on account of ill health. For a number of years he was a vestryman, secretary and treasurer of St. Andrew's church. He was a member of Fraternity Lodge, F. and A. M. He was city recorder 1864-66; alderman for fourth ward 1870-71; recording secretary of the Washtenaw county pioneer society; recording secretary of the Washtenaw county agricultural and horticultural society, 1882. He left every position of trust that he ever occupied with the benediction, well and faithfully done. In 1855 he married Miss Frances E. Kingsley, only daughter of the late Hon. James Kingsley, who survives him. He also leaves three children, Vol

At the annual meeting of the Michigan Pioneer and Historical Society, Lansing, June 2, 1887, the following resolutions, offered by Rev. R. C. Crawford, were unanimously adopted by a rising vote: WHEREAS, In the providence of God, our friend and brother, Rev. Henry M. Joy, D.D., has been called from labor to reward, since our last annual gathering, therefore, Resolved, That while we bow submissively to the dispensation, of that mysterious Providence, which so suddenly removed him from our communion and the society of his wife and son, our hearts are saddened with the thought that we shall see his manly form no more, and that we shall never again listen to his eloquent speech, nor to his musical voice in song. Resolved, That we extend to his bereaved and stricken wife and son our heartfelt sympathies, and assure them that this society will hold them in remembrance and commend them to the care of Him who has said: "I will be a father to the fatherless and the widow's God." Rosolved, That a copy of these resolutions be forwarded to the bereaved family with the best wishes of all the members of this society.

PAPERS READ AT ANNUAL MEETING, 1887, AND OTHER CONTRIBUTIONS. THE ORDINANCE OF 1787. ADDRESS OF HON. CYRUS G. LUCE, GOVERNOR. Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen of the Pioneer Society: The subject upon which I am invited to present a few thoughts to-day, while old, is always new. The fate of nations has frequently turned upon what at the time of the occurrence seemed to be events of trifling importance. And this is eminently true of the adoption of the ordinance of 1787, for the government of the territory northwest of the river Ohio. It applied only to the government of an uninhabited wilderness, where the Indian and wild beast roamed at will. No portion of its air was disturbed by the echo of the white man's tread. Yet, an ordinance for the future government of this wild waste has been, as the sequel proved, momentous and far reaching in its results. In these it is scarcely excelled by the adoption of the Declaration of Independence, July 4, 1776. When the forefathers bid defiance to the authority of the mother country, they seemed to entertain but an indefinite conception of what the future policy of a general government should be. The old patriots at that time were devoted lovers of freedom, of liberty and of education. They had fled across the broad Atlantic to escape oppression from onerous taxation, from inteiference with religious liberty, and sought the wild American shores, faced the dangers of the deep, of wild animals, and of a wilder and fiercer population of Indians, for the sake of the enjoyment of freedom and liberty. The British yoke oppressed them, and they risked their all in a heroic effort to escape its thralldom. But the basis upon which the effort rested was a common interest, and they fought together simply because they could more certainly protect their separate colonial existence. But the idea of a central consolidated government of superior power, olothed

"with authority to enforce its mandates, seems not to have been entertained or hardly conceived. The consolidating process w"s one of slow growth, for seventy five years. Of course the embarrassment of the situation was forcibly realized during the revolutionary war and long years after its close. At home and abroad people doubted the validity or value of paper issued by those colonies, who had simply entered into a confederation without recognizing the binding force and responsibility of a general government. This was painfully apparent in the valueless paper issued to prosecute the war of the revolution. And the first or most important step taken toward a recognition of the fact that the colonies had successfully fought their way to freedom and independence, and were tending towards consolidation as a nation, was the adoption of the memorable ordinance of 1787. And while the journals of the early sessions of congress are incomplete, compared with the voluminous records now kept, we can see the process of reasoning which resulted in the adoption of this ordinance. This contains within itself nearly all the fundamental principles upon which the government has stood the test of a hundred years. It was the vital and turning point in the early history of this nation. It laid broad and deep the foundation for strength, greatness, prosperity, liberty and education. And in taking the step towards a recognition of the principle which is now recognized by all of our people, north, south, east and west, that we are a nation, they commenced a struggle in our civilization that closed three quarters of a century later at Appomattox. It was largely to establish this principle that the war of the rebellion was fought, so that, in this respect, the adoption of the ordinance of 1787 formed an important epoch in our history. In all things that relate to good government and the welfare of our people its importance can hardly be over estimated. Article III. declares that "general morality and knowledge, being necessary to the good of a government and the happiness of mankind, schools and the means of education shall forever be encouraged." A hundred years ago, the men who framed and adopted this ordinance conceived the necessity of morality and education, as the underlying strength of a republic, and expressed it as forcibly and concisely as the most learned patriot of to-day can do. Again, they declared that "the inhabitants of said territory shall always be entitled to the benefits of the writ of habeas corpus, of a trial by jury, of a proportionate representation of the people in the legislature and of judicial proceedings according to the course of common law. No cruel or unjust punishment shall be inflicted, no man shall be deprived of his liberty, or his property, but by the judgment of his peers or the law of the land." That was good law, good patriotism and essential to the preservation of the freedom of

the people and the enjoyment of civil liberty a hundred years ago, and is equally so to-day. The far seeing legislators of that period declared that no tax shall be imposed on lands the property of the United States, and in no case shall non-residents be taxed higher than residents. They seemed to have anticipated many of the conflicts which have from time to time arisen, many of the notions and purposes which have to some extent prevailed in later years and in a more advanced civilization. But the crowning glory of the ordinance of 1787 is contained in the sixth article. This has been often quoted and righteously revered by lovers of freedom everywhere. It reads, "( there shall be neither slavery nor involuntary servitude in the said territory, otherwise than in the punishment of crime, whereof the party shall have been duly convicted." The adoption of this one single provision has changed the whole past, present and future of the empire. It has established freedom as the corner-stone of American civilization. No wiser thoughts were ever coined into words or law than these. It was the turning point, and as it applied then to a trackless wilderness, it was possibly not regarded at the time of such vast importance as it afterwards proved to be. If the fathers had neglected to have placed this one single provision in the ordinance of 1787, the whole character of our people, of our institutions, and everything pertaining to us in the past, present and future, would in all human probability, have been changed. And when we reflect upon the consequences, we are filled with admiration for the men, who, struggling with difficulties untold, merging from the results ot a terrific conflict, poor, in debt, grappling with an unsolved problem, who could still scan the future so accurately as to perceive the propriety and necessity of this ordinance. In the territory to be more directly affected by its adoption there was no voice to be heard in its favor at that time, while now it embraces the great and prosperous states of Ohio, Indiana, Michigan, Illinois and Wisconsin, with nearly one fourth of the population of the whole republic; dotted with cities and villages, cultivated fields, comfortable farm houses, school houses and churches, and checkered throughout its length and breadth by railroads. This section furnishes the most productive grain fields of the world. And not only does this ordinance affect the people embraced within the territory over which it applied, but in its reflex influence it is extended away beyond. Doubtless if it had not been for this prohibitory ordinance, slavery with its blighting influence would have crossed the Ohio and entrenched itself in this territory dedicated forever to freedom and its blessings. It will be remembered that this territory had recently been ceded by the state of Virginia to the United States, and that the representatives of the old commonwealth participated in the adoption of the ordinance which provided for its government. And.~~~~~ " **.l

whatever we may think of the course afterwards pursued, of the devotion to slavery, of the hatred of universal freedom, of the enthrallment of a race, of the terrific and frantic efforts made to maintain the institution of slavery, of the states where it existed, yet we must honor their representatives of a hundred years ago for their participation in the adoption of a measure that finally gave freedom to the whole nation. It is true at that time there were neither slaves nor freemen in this territory, but while the result has far exceeded the brightest anticipations of the old patriots, yet they, with the eye of faith, could see the section devoted to freedom teeming with a busy and happy population. And whether we credit the adoption of the provision contained in the sixth article to the influence of Massachusetts and New York, or to a latent love of freedom entertained by the representatives from Delaware, North Carolina, South Carolina, Virginia, and Georgia, I-should fail to do justice to my own sentiments did I neglect to do honor to the representatives of these states where slavery then existed, did I fail to note the fact that each of these states cast its solid vote on the 13th day of July, 1787, to make freedom, and not slavery, the law governing the northwest territory. And we must in justice honor the men who had the patriotism, though surrounded by slavery, to see and act for the best interests of posterity. And while in our hatred of slavery and in the strife of political conflict, and in the fiercer passions of war, we have thought hard thoughts and said severe things of the policy of Virginia, the Carolinas and Georgia, we should never forget that their representatives had it in their power to have defeated the provision a hundred years ago, which has forever rendered this country a home of freem en. This tribute to the birthplace of my mother and of my maternal ancestors is cheerfully and truthfully rendered. The representatives from these states were at least in this one respect as loyal to the principles of freedom as were the representatives from Massachusetts and New York. This is the centennial year of the adoption of the ordinance, and it is well that we celebrate the occasion. Its spirit has sometimes been misunderstood or perverted, but within the next 12 months it will be appreciated as never before. It will be celebrated and its praises sung. The most important of all these celebrations will be held at Marietta on the 7th of April, 1838, just one hundred years from the first settlement of the territory at that place. Michigan has been invited to participate with its sister states in this celebration. A monument will be erected in honor of the occasion, and I trust that our state, ever foremost in good works, in enterprise and in energy, will devise some method to raise means in aid of the erection of this monument. The Pioneer Society, representing the early settlers, will doubtless give consideration to this

important subject. The legislature has authorized the governor to appoint a commission of five to represent the state on the occasion of the celebration. It must be a labor of love and of devotion, because no compensation is provided for the delegates, but I doubt not that patriotic, generous men will be found who will do honor to our state in this gathering of the children of the ordinance of 1787. THE CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES. ADDRESS OF HON. DANIEL P. MARKEY, SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES. Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen: Sometime since I was requested to address you at this time for a few minutes upon a subject of great interest to all Americans, and one which must from its very nature always remain of vital importance to us as a nation: "The Constitution of the United States." Your secretary very kindly informed me that I would not need to occupy more than ten minutes with this subject. And in that time, while I will probably be able to tell you all I know about it, you will understand that the subject can only be superficially spoken of. The subject is one that I shall be ablo to say nothing new upon, and can hardly expect to say anything of interest to you. One hundred years ago the 17th day of September next, the convention which met at Philadelphia, May 14, 1787, for the purpose of revising the federal system of government, completed its work and submitted to the people of the thirteen original states, as the result of their labors, "1The Constitution of the United States," the most sublime instrument among the political achievements of mankind. And this being the centennial anniversary of this memorable epoch, it is certainly not out of place to spend some time in a review of the causes which led to the calling of that convention, to the work of the convention, and the subsequent proceedings by which the constitution it prepared became the bond of union between the states, as well as the organic law of the greatest nation yet fashioned by the hand of man.

CAUSES' OF THE FORMATION OF THE CONSTITUTION.

145

Prior to July 4, 1776, none of the colonies were or pretended to be sovereign states as that term is now understood in its broadest sense. Their powers and authorities were derived from and limited by their respective charters, and while under these charters they exercised, within a limited extent, certain usual attributes of sovereignty; so far as respects foreign nations, or each other, they were mere dependencies of Great Britain. Up to this time, while the colonies had met, by their representatives, in council and congress, the most solemn declarations of these bodies admitted them bound as British subjects to allegiance to the British Grown, and as such they claimed to be entitled to all the rights, liberties and immunities of free born British subjects. But on this ever memorable day their general congress boldly and deliberately declared that "' these united colonies are and of right ought to be free and independent states," and that all further allegiance to the British Crown is and ought to be totally dissolved. This was not an act done by any of the state governments then organized, nor by persons chosen by them, but it was purely the act of the whole people of the united colonies, by the instrumentality of their representatives, chosen for that, among other purposes. It was an act of original inherent sovereignty by the people themselves, resulting from their right to change the form of government, and to institute a new government whenever necessary for their safety and happiness; and as such the Declaration of Independence has ever been treated, not only as a practical fact, but as a legal and constitutional matter by the courts. It will be remembered that although the Declaration of Independence was not agreed to and signed until July 4, the resolutions respecting independency were moved and seconded on June 7, and that on the 10th of June the committee, consisting of Mr. Jefferson, Mr. John Adams? Mr. Franklin, Mr. Sherman and A.r. Livingston was appointed to prepare the declaration. Anticipating the report of this committde and the final action of congress upon the resolutions, on the next day, June 11, a resolution was adopted to appoint a committee, to consist of one member from each colony, to prepare and digest the form of a confederation to be entered into between the colonies. The report of this committee, embodying what is now known as the "Articles of Confederation," was not adopted until November 15, 1777, more than 17 months after the committee was appointed. At the same time it was ordered that the articles of confederation agreed upon should be submitted to the legislatures of all the United States for their consideration, and if approved by them they were requested to authorize their delegates in congress to ratify the same, which being done, the same should become conclusive. During the year 1778, all of the states approved of the articles.of confederation. Delaware approved of them May 5, 1779, and Maryland, the 19

Thus it will be seen that thn war of the Revolution was nearing a close before the provisions of the new system became binding upon all the states. During all the years from 1774 when the first continental congress assembled, down to the time of the going into effect of the new system, the government of the United States was in a deplorable condition. The war of the Revolution was in progress. The states were endeavoring to free themselves from the thralldom of the British yoke, and lay the foundation of a nation consecrated to freedom, and how this was done under such a government will be the wonder of ages yet to come. The two great wants of the colonies during this period were money to support their armies, and some general authority to direct their course on the field. The former they never succeeded in getting in sufficient quiantities, but the latter was fully supplied in the person of George Washington. The more far seeing statesmen of those days saw the necessity for a stronger and firmer government, but local jealousies, instantly aroused at the mere suggestion of a strong government, prevented anything from being accomplished in that direction. The new system was simply a confederacy of sovereign states. All the powers of the general government were vested in congress, and its power was delegated, the states being sovereign. The moit important of the privileges of congress under this system were the right of making war and peace, the regulation of foreign intercourse, the control of the coinage of money and care of the public domain. There was no chief executive of the general government, and no general judiciary. Under it each stato had an equal voice in approving of the laws of congress, which, before becoming operative, must have the sanction of at least nine "states. And the union was declared to be perpetual. As before stated, congress assembled under this new government March 2, 1781. And it found its first great duty to be to provide for paying the war debt, which had now reached about thirty eight millions of dollars. But under the articles of confederation, congress had no power to do more than recommend to the states the levy of a tax for this purpose. This it did. Some of the states complied, others were dilatory, others refused. So that it was immediately discovered that the system was entirely inadequate to the needs of the country, and that unless it could be replaced with a better system, the country would go to ruin. However, the system was tolerated and no public action taken towards its betterment until 1785, four years later, when General Washington, in con

THE CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION.

ference with a company of the leading minds of the day, suggested the calling of a convention at Annapolis the following year, to take the matter of a change under advisement. This convention met in September, 1786; only five of the states were represented. The question of a tariff on imports, and a revision of the articles of confederation were discussed, and the convention adjourned to meet the following May. The convention met again May 14, 1787. The war had now closed and the national debt amounted to forty two millions of dollars,- eight millions of which were due France and Holland, our most generous allies, and the government was practically powerless to redeem the national honor. It now became evident to all who wanted to see the union preserved and made something more than " a rope of sand," who wanted to see favorably decided, the great question, "whether societies of men are really capable or not of establishing good government from reflection and choice, or whether they are forever destined to depend for their.political constitutions on accident and force," that some radical changes must be made in the system of government designed to bind the individual states together into a strong and stable nation, if that laudable object was to be accomplished and the union perpetuated. This convention, which met on May 14, really began its work on the 25th of May, when, a majority of the states being represented, it proceeded to organize by the election of George Washington as president and William Jackson, secretary. In this convention we find the ablest statesmen of that day and age in America. Among the number were the names of Hamilton, Livingston, Franklin, King, Morris, Randolph, Madison and Pinckney-men whose names to-day are familiar to every school boy, and whose acts and sacrifices in behalf of the American nation will ever be remembered by a grateful people. Mr. Elliott says of this convention: " Whatever may be the judgment pronounced on the competency of the architects of the constitution, or whatever may be the destiny of the edifice prepared by them, there never was an assembly of men charged with a great and arduous trust who were more pure in their motives or more exclusively or anxiously devoted to the object committed to them than were the members of the federal convention of 1787, to the object of devising and proposing a constitutional system which" should best supply the defects of that which it was to replace, and best secure the permanent liberty and happiness of their country." Alexander H. Stephens says of this convention: "As a whole it was unquestionably the ablest body of jurists, legislators and statesmen that had ever assembled on the continent of America." And now, without stopping to dwell in detail upon the work of this con

vention, which lasted more than. four months, the entire proceedings of which were had with closed doors, and not published until more than forty years afterwards, suffice to say that on the 17th day of September, 1787, the engrossed copy of the constitution was read over to the convention, and, having been agreed upon, all the members of the convention, save Mr. Randall, Mr. Mason and Mr. Gerry signed the same and it was ready to be submitted to the conventions of the respective states for their adoption. While the last members were signing, Dr. Franklin, looking towards the president's chair, back of which a rising sun happened to be painted, observed to a few members near him that painters had found it difficult to distinguish between a rising sun and a setting sun. "I have," said he, "often in the course of the session and vicissitudes of my hopes and fears as to its issue, looked at that behind the president without being able to tell whether it was rising or setting; but now, at length, I have the happiness to know that it is a rising and not a setting sun." Of the result of the labors of this convention let others speak. Alexander H. Stephens says: "Several of the features in this new form and constitution of government for separate states and communities are without a parallel in ancient or modern times." De Tocqueville, the profound French philosopher, and one thoroughly versed in the science of politics, speaking of our constitution, says: " This constitution which may at first be confounded with the federal constitutions which have preceded it, rests, in truth, upon a wholly novel theory, which may be considered a great discovery in modern political science. In all the confederations which preceded the American constitution of 1789, the allied states, for a common object, agreed to obey the injunctions of a federal government, but they reserved to themselves the right of ordaining and enforcing the laws of the union. The American states which combined ia 1789 agreed that the federal government should not only dictate but should execute its own enactments. In both cases the right is the same, but the exercise of the right is different and this difference produced the most momentous consequences." Lord Brougham, in his "Political Philosophy," says of the wonderful machinery of the government of the United States: "It is not at all -a refinement that a federal union should be formed; this is the natural result of men's joint operations in a very rude state of society. But the regulation of such an union upon pre-established principles, the formation of a system of government and legislation in which different subjects shall be, not individuals but states, the application of legislative principles to such a body of states, and the devising means for keeping its integrity as a federacy,



Page 149
RATIFICATION.

149

while the rights and powers of the individual states are maintained entire, is the greatest refinement in social policy to which any state of circumstances has ever given rise, or to which any age has ever given birth." Should the work of this convention/ be adopted by the states, the word constitution would have here a very different signification from that which prevails in England. Here it would mean as it does now "a written statement of the fundamental rules of government," while there it simply means the leading rules of government without reference to any formal statement. The constitution there consists of documents emanating from time to time from the king or from parliament and of traditions and customs. These may be collected and reduced to a systematic form, but have never received the legal sanction indispensable in America--that of recognition by the nation as distinguished from parliament. In this country "the people," consisting in each state of those who hold the elective franchise, are by presoribed forms called upon at intervals either to establish the constitution or to amend it. It thus has atn authority greater than the authority of the government organized under it. One extremely important result is that if any of the departments of the government exceed the limits marked out in the constitution the act is irregular and void. An illustration is found in an act of the legislature which transcends the constitution; the judicial department will declare it void. The courts have no such power in England. An act of parliament is commonly declared to be omnipotent. There is no judicial power that can arrest the regular operation of the act. The one great question now, was, will the people ratify the acts of the convention, and while at this late day we may wonder how they could think of refusing their assent to such an instrument, nevertheless, much hostility was manifested in nearly all the states and it required the united efforts of all its friends to secure its adoption. Among those who took an active part in this work were Washington, Jay, Madison, and last but by no means least in this effort was Alexander Hamilton, who threw the whole force of his genius and learning into the work, and with Mr. Madison, by means of those able papers called the Federalist, successfully answered every objection of those who opposed its adoption, and became thereby the first 'and without doubt the greatest expounder of free constitutional government in America. The people lost no time in preparing for action on the adoption of theconstitution. Delaware first answered the question by unanimously adopting it Dec. 3, and New Jersey on the 19th. Next came Georgia on the 2d of January, followed by Connecticut on the 9th of the same month. Then came Massachusetts, Maryland,. South Carolina, and on June 21st the work was done, after a hard struggle, by a vote of 57 to 46; New Hampshire had approved of

THE NEW GOVERNMENT.

it, and, being the ninth state, the new government was now to go into effect; but by June 27, all the states, save Rhode Island and North Carolina, had signified their approval. These two states did not agree to its adoption until after several amendments had been proposed and adopted by congress, which were of such a nature as to make the instrument in the main agreeable to them. Q Under that provision of the constitution which allows amendments to be made, up to the present time 15 amendments have been adopted. The most important of these are the articles which guarantee religious.freedom, change the method of electing president and vice president, abolish slavery and forbid the abridgment of suffrage on account of race or color. On the first Wednesday in January, 1789, agreeably to the provisions oftthe new constitution, the first election for president took place, and when the result of this election was canvassed before congress early in April following, it was found that George Washington was unanimously chosen as the chief executiveWith the administration of President Washington began the existence of the United States as a nation under the new constitution. This instrument has had, in the sunshine of peace and in the storm of war, a severe but fair trial, and it has amply fulfilled the expectations of its most ardent friends, and as subsequently amended, it has become the rule of political conduct for the guidance of the public authorities of the greatest nation of modern times, through the unprecedented political vicissitudes and the perilous revolutionary commotions that have agitated the human race for nearly a century, to a condition at once so prosperous, so commanding and so happy, that it has long since outstripped all previous foresight and calculation. Well indee# might Dr. Franklin have reached the conclusion that the sun that shone for the new nation was a rising sun. The nation under this constitution has passed through stormy times, but has come at last to its hundredth year in peace. The black clouds of war have broken and have passed away. The union has only become the more perfect and the bonds that bind its various parts together into one grand symmetrical nation are stronger to-day than ever before, and we may now confidently predict that the hopes of those who framed the first articles of confederation are to be realized and that the union of the states has been made perpetual. And now in this centennial year how fitting it is that we should rise above sectional jealousies and feelings and iu a spirit of fraternal affection and regard, renew our vows of fealty to the constitution, and by proper ceremonies such as are proposed to take place at Philadelphia on the 17th of September itext, announce to future generations that for them as for us and those who have gone before, the "constitution " is the ark of the covenant, and that if they

would be happy, peaceful and properous as a nation, let them maintain it in its true spirit inviolate forever. DISPUTED QUESTIONS IN THE EARLY HISTORY OF MICHIGAN. BY HON. EDWARD W. PECK, OF PONTIAC. I was at the annual meeting of your society in June, 1886, and became a member. I listened with pleasure to the remarks of the members, the history of their experiences, their labor, trials, disappointments, and, as well, their successes. During your sessions, your then president extended an invitation to the members to write up and forward to the secretary any incidents of their personal history, or of the locality where they first settled in the state, or any other matters of history, either of local or general interest. I signed my name to a paper accepting the invitation of the president, without a moment's consideration, and probably unwisely; but now I think you will have to bear tje infliction, and that you may take comfort and consolation in the thought that the invitation will not be repeated. First, I must give you a few words of personal history. I am a descendant of William Peck, who was born in London, England, in 1601, and with his wife, and son Jeremiah came to America in 1637, settling in New Haven, Connecticut. The descendants of said William, brought down to 1877, the date of the publication of his book, numbered nearly 3,000, and are scattered over the United States, and some in foreign countries. My grandfather with six sons and four daughters, emigrated from Lyme, Connecticut, and settled in West Bloomfield, Ontario county, New York, in 1800. I was born March 19, 1807, and being the oldest son of the family, was early initiated into the mysteries and labors of farming. The labors of the farmer at that early day were vastly more severe than at the present. We had none of the labor saving machinery now in use. The mower, the reaper and binder, the cultivators, the threshing machine, were not then known, and the t6ols and implements of husbandry were of the roughest

kind, and it is doubtful if any of the pioneers of the present day, have followed the wooden plow, which had a small point of iron or steel, or have threshed their wheat and other grain with a flail, and cleaned it in the wind. My education was such as could be acquired in the common district school' and commenced in the little log school house on the corner, with slab benches for the scholars to sit on, and a cross legged table for the use of the school mistress. The school books in general use were Webster's spelling book, the English reader. Lindley Murray's English grammer, Daboll's arithmetic, and Morse's geography; and the books were not changed, as is the modern custom, in the interest of the book makers, but not unfrequently lasted through the family. Continuing to work on my father's farm until I was twenty one, he then having sufficient help from younger brothers, I hired out for two seasons to neighboring farmers for thirteen dollars a month, and taught district schools for two winters at thirteen and fifteen dollars a month. In May, 1830, in company with some friends, I came to Michigan on a tour of observation. We spent some weeks in Detroit, in Washtenaw and Oakland counties, and at Pontiac, then a small town with fair prospects. We returned to Detroit and waited several days for the arrival of the steamboat, Henry Clay (which was thougt to be a marvel), in order to take passage to Buffalo. The population of Michigan according to the United States census of that year was 31,649, and of Detroit, 2,200. The Detroit and Sagin'aw turnpike was then in course of construction, six or seven miles having been completed, by laying the logs across the road, and partially covering theft with earth, and many of us know what sort of a road we had. I returned home and worked on my father's farm until Oct. 1, 1831, when having decided to become a citizen of Michigan, I left my native town and came to Michigan, expecting to attack the forest. I was the owner of some timbered land in Washtenaw county. I had some axes secured in the bottom of my chest, which contained my clothing suitable for farmers' use. Coming up Lake Erie on a steamboat, my purpose was changed, and I settled in Troy, Oakland county, and engaged in merchandising, which business I continued for some sixteen years. Troy was one of the earliest settled towns in Oakland county, in the east and southeast part of Oakland county adjoining Macomb county on the east. The first land bought in the township was Feb. 12, 1819, under the two dollar act, and from that date up to 1830, the lands were rapidly taken under the ten shilling act, and at that date a large proportion, probably three fourths of the whole was taken, and on February 17, 1836, the last description in the township was taken. The pioneer society of Oakland county has on its records the names of those making the entries, the date of entries, and the descriptions of all the

153

lands in the township, a valuable paper, obtained at the United States land office at Detroit, by the Hon vice president, 0. Poppleton, and from the same paper I have gathered some thoughts, facts and statistics which I am at liberty to use. The rapidity with which the lands in Troy were taken is remarkable, when we take this fact into consideration, that they were nearly all heavily timbered with oak, some beech and maple, white wood, black walnut, hickory and many others varieties, requiring not only physical strength, but perseverance, indomitable courage and energy. To the character of the early pioneer, does the township of Troy owe her unparalleled development and the prosperity which gaveher rank with the first townships in the county. Most of the early settlers were from the pioneer families of western New York, and were well fitted by discipline and experience to enter upon a new life in the forests of the township. It required a strong will, energy and physical power to fell the heavy timber that encumbered the land, to clear and fence it to erect their log houses and barns, improve their lands, build their roads and bridges, yet they were equal to the occasion, and well did they perform the task, and I may venture the remark that there are no more beautiful farms, farm houses and landscapes in the state; and while I would not unduly exalt the character of the early settlers of Troy and thereby by inference detract from the just praise due those of other localities, I will say that they "were in everything that helps to make up a first class community, far above the average of those usually settling in new countries. I shall be allowed to extend my remarks to cover more ground than the township of Troy, where I first settled, or the county of Oakland where I have been a resident for more than fifty five years. I would like to take a wider range and give a few thoughts in regard to the admission of our state into the Union. I am aware that much has been said on the subject, and at the semi-centennial last June, there were additions to that history, but I will hazard the opinion, that some facts in relation to our admission have not been well understood, and if ever understood will bear a repetition or emphasizing. It is with the view of placing upon the records of this "State Pioneer Society" some additional facts, trials and incidents, without which the true history of our admission would be in my opinion quite incomplete, that I refer to the subject. About the year 1834 the pioneers (we were all pioneers then), perhaps I should say the politicians, became ambitious to become a state, and as the ordinance of 1787, the charter of our rights, authorized Michigan when she had a papulation of 60,000 free inhabitants to become a state, and having by a census of the territory found that we had a population of 87,000 and over, and so declared by the legislative council of the territory, early in 1835 the legislative council passed an act providing for a convention to be held in May of that year. Delegates 20

154 STATE CONSTITUTION-BOUNDARY. were accordingly elected and met in Detroit, and numbered 89, and continued in session until June 24, when having completed their labors by adopting a constitution, the same was submitted to the people in the fall of that year, and adopted by the people with little opposition. The southern boundary of the state was in accord with the ordinance of 1787, being an east and west line drawn through the southerly extreme of Lake Michigan until it intersected Lake Erie. As early as 1802 congress passed an act to enable the people of Ohio to organize a state government, in which it is declared that the northern boundary should be established by an east and west line drawn through the southerly extreme of Lake Michigan until it intersected Lake Erie and thence through Lake Erie to the Pennsylvania line. Ohio, in framing her constitution, adopted this line with a variation, so as to include the site of Toledo; the constitution was referred to a committee in Congress who reported that it was not necessary or expedient to act upon it at all, and thus it remained until 1805, when congress passed an act in accordance with the ordinance of 1787 to divide what was known as the Indian Territory into separate governments, erected Michigan into a separate territory, defining her southern boundary to be a line drawn east from the southerly bond of Lake Michigan until it intersects Lake Erie. This left the strip of land that Ohio wanted within the boundaries of Michigan, and it was conclusive of the justice of her claims; and right here I may properly refer to the extreme selfishness of the great state of Ohio. She had a front on Lake Erie of one hundred and fifty or two hundred miles, with at least half a dozen ports of entry on the lake, and did not need Toledo. Michigan had only one Toledo, and might most reasonably have expected to enjoy her own in peace, but this would not satisfy the greed of Ohio; Toledo -he would have, and having failed to show any legal or equitable right to it, she would take it by the strong arm of her boasted " million of freemen." Early in 1835 the legislature of Ohio passed an act extending the jurisdiction of the state over the tract which she wanted. Gov. Mason, of Michigan, ever watchful of her interests, called the legislative council together, and on February 12, 1835, the council passed an act making it a criminal offense for any person to attempt to exercise any official act, duty or office within the jurisdiction of Mlichigan, under any authority not derived from Michigan or the United States. The governor of Ohio still persisting in his determination to rob Michigan of her vested rights, called out a volunteer force of 600 -men, and proceeded with his commissioners to Perrrysburg, near the line, with the avowed purpose of surveying and marking the line of the tract heproposed to take. Gov. Mason of Michigan having watched the action of the governor of Ohio, was not in the least inclined to submit to be shorn of our

territory, and the pioneers, generally, sympathized with the governor. War seemed inevitable, and in the emergency our ambitious, young and patriotic governor called out the military to the number of twelve to fifteen hundred. Oakland county had a regiment of riflemen, in which I held a commission, and some small companies of cavalry, and the ununiformed troops were drafted. Oar regiment was called to Pontiac by the proper officers for organization, and having effected that object we were ordered to rendezvous at Plymouth for further organization on a given day, and on the day named we left our wives and little ones to engage in a struggle for our rights. There were some incidents of that campaign which I take the liberty of presenting. After leaving Plymouth, having completed our organization, we proceeded immediately on our way to the seat of war at Toledo, and by a forced march on a sultry day in September, we reached the River Raisin, a few miles above Monroe, on Saturday evening. A large and commodious farm house, with large and convenient barns and other buildings, promised comfortable protection and shelter for the troops. That evening before it was quite dark, an uproar was raised; the owner of the premises missed a fine hive of honey, but the pursuit of the thieves was so prompt that the honey was found on the grass near the river, and the empty hive in the river. The man who carried the hive upon his shoulder, found that the bees were quite as unwilling as the Michigan men to be robbed of their rightful property, and resented it by stinging him upon his neck so powerfully as to paralyze him. In this emergency the boys were in a strait what to do, and avoid detection, but one, more suggestive than the rest, proposed to apply mud from the clay bank of the river, which had a good effect, and he recovered. There was plenty of honey in the house that night, and General Hascall, the senior officer, partook of it so freely, that at an early hour the next morning I saw him bending over the fence in the rear of the house, with positive indications that he had taken more honey than he could carry. A court martial was ordered in the morning, to which all the commissioned officers were invited, but no witnesses could be found that knew anything about it, and the court martial adjourned, subject to the call of the president, but nothing was heard of it afterward. The troop3 marched on to Monroe that Sabbath morning. The officers obtained quarters in a large room in a hotel, and the men in the court house. About midnight a messenger from General]Brown, who was in command of the forces at Toledo, was announced, and coming into the room where the officers were sleeping, the dispatch of General Brown was read, requiring the troops to proceed to headquarters immediately, and ending with the announcement, "The enemy are in force." Early in the morning steamboats were

procured and the footmen embarked, the cavalry companies going across the country on horseback. On nearing Toledo, steaming up the Maumee, it was found that the men had loaded their rifles with powder and ball without any authority, and entirely without the knowledge of the officers, it manifestly being the expectation of the men that there was to be fighting, and I am sure it was wise in Governor Lucas to keep his men on their own side of the line. Approaching the landing, no resistance being offered, we landed and remained two or three days. No enemy appearing we were reviewed by Gov. Mason. "The boys" became experts in drawing rations of vegetables from Stickney's garden, who had rendered himself obnoxious to Michigan men. There being nothing further to do there, the whole army was ordered back to Monroe, and there on a beautiful September day, in a splendid field for the display, the army was massed into a hollow square, Gov. Mason rode in, accompanied by his aids, and throwing his chapeau upon the ground eloquently commended the troops for their soldierly bearing, and most emphatically expressed his unalterable determination to spill the last drop of blood in his veins, if need be, in defending the rights of Michigan in the boundary question. There being no hostile force to oppose, the troops were ordered to return to their homes, and to remain under arms for thirty days. Gov. Lucas, of Ohio, disbanded his troops, being advised by embassadors from Washington that serious consequences might result to him and the state, if he made any further attempt to take possession of the line Ohio wanted, by force, and that in the judgment of the United States attorney general, the action of the state of Ohio was in conflict with the law of congress of 1805, and that the action of the legislative council of Michigan, which was being enforced by Gov. Mason, was clearly legal. Perhaps we of Michigan ought to have a little sympathy for the great state of Ohio, in view of all her trials and disappointments in her efforts to obtain the coveted Toledo. For more than thirty years her efforts had been persistently continued, with failure every time, while the apparent odds were largely in her favor, so far as numbers were concerned, as she had nineteen voting members of congress, while Michigan had none. In the first effort she sought to smuggle in the coveted Toledo, by stretching her state line over it, contrary to the act of Congress of 1802. She might with equal propriety have taken in Detroit, but failing in her numerous efforts down to 1835, sho would now strangle the infant Michigan with her "million of freemen." But here again she was disastrously defeated. The United States government at Washington, told her very distinctly to keep hands off, not to attempt to take the place wanted by force, and now the humiliating alternative was pre

sented. She must obtain the consent of Michigan to be robbed, before she could obtain the prize. Did she obtain that consent? We shall see. On the 15th day of June, 1836, Congress passed an act, entitled an "act toestablish the northern boundary of the state of Ohio, and to provide for the admission of the state of Michigan into the Union, upon the conditions. therein expressed;" section one gives the northern boundary line of the state of Ohio as she wanted it. Section two, "and be it further enacted, that the. constitution and state government, which the people of Michigan have formed for themselves be, and the same is hereby accepted, ratified and confirmed, and that the said state of Michigan shall be, and is hereby declared to be one of "the United States of America, and is hereby admitted into theUnion upon an equal footing with the original states, in all respects whatso- K ever;" provides always, and here Congress inserted a provision extending the boundaries of the state of Michigan, to include an additional tract of land in the upper peninsula, contrary to the constitution of the state which had been adopted by the people of the state, and accepted and ratified and confirmed by Congress, and further enacted, that as a compliance with the fundamental condition of admission contained in the last preceding section of this act, the boundaries of the said state of Michigan, as in said section described, shall receive the assent of a convention of delegates, elected by the people of said state, for the sole purpose of giving the assent herein required. In accordance with the foregoing the governor of Michigan immediately called the legislature together to provide for the election, and to apportion the delegates among the several counties of the state according to population, as follows: giving to Wayne county eight, Monroe four, Lenawee four, Washtenaw and Livingston seven, Oakland six, Cass and St. Joseph each two, Kalamazoo two, St. Clair one, Berrien one, Calhoun one, Jackson one, Macomb three, Branch one, Hillsdale one, Lapeer one, Saginaw, Genesee and Shiawassee one, Mackinaw one, Chippewa one, Ottawa, Kent, Ionia and Clinton one,-Barry one. In accordance with the above the delegates were duly elected and certified and met at Ann Arbor on the 4th Monday of September,. 1836, and organized by the election of the Hon. Wm. Draper, of Oakland county, as president. The convention consisted of 49 members, and the question before the convention was at once introduced, and duly considered. I was a member of the convention from the county of Oakland, and was in constant attendance at all its sessions and know of what I affirm. There was. not in the convention a thought expressed in regard to what the Hon. ex-Judge Cooley calls the "compromise proposition," that Michigan received for all that was taken from her on the southern boundary, more than princely compensation. I challenge the correctness of:that statement. In a recent

WORTH OF THE UPPER PENINSULA.

conversation with an ex-member of Congress from this district, and who has served the people of the state in the legislature and on the bench, and has resided in the state more than fifty years, and is as well qualified to judge of values as any man in it, he says of the upper peninsula at the time it was tendered us, "it wasn't worth eighteen pence." Another gentleman of more than fifty years' residence here, says of it to-day to me, it was "not worth a dollar." I would modestly give my opinion that the upper peninsula, comparatively speaking, was worthless. I will call one more witness, that the erroneous idea may never be brought forth again, that Michigan received "more than princely compensation for what was taken from her." The veteran Governor Felch, in his address at the semi-centennial, says, " Of the upper peninsula, nothing was known and nothing expected from it." Additional evidence on the same point might be offered to an unlimited extent, but it has seemed quite unnecessary. That the upper peninsula by its developments and openings during the past fifty years has now become valuable, is not to be taken and regarded as evidence of "more than princely compensation " for the port of Toledo; nor as evidence of the liberality of Congress, or Ohio, to Michigan. Congress probably thought, here is Wisconsin, she has no vote hero, but is anxiously waiting for admission; we will take from her what is not known or regarded of any value and give it to Michigan; those additional acres may possibly appease the just wrath of Michigan, in view of the robbery we contemplate of her, and all will be lovely, and this was probably the sharp practice spoken of by Judge Cooley. I copy from the journal of the proceedings of the convention the official result of its action, which was just and wise, and ought to have been final. The record of the proceedings of the convention was certified to by the Hon. William Draper, president, and Charles A. Jeffries and Samuel York AtLee, secretaries. " WHEREAS, The congress of the United States by an act entitled an act to establish the northern boundary of the state of Ohio, and to provide for the admission of the state of Michigan into the union, upon the conditions therein expressed, approved June 15, 1836, did enact and declare that the constitution and state government, which the people of Michigan have formed for themselves, be, and the same is hereby accepted, ratified and confirmed, and that the said state of Michigan shall be, and is hereby declared to be one of the United States of America, and is hereby admitted into the union, upon an equal footing with the original states in all respects whatsoever, thereby acknowledging our constitution as republican, and in accordance with the constitution of the United States, and the ordinance of 1787, and whereas congress has also in said act inserted a proviso proposing a radical alteration of our southern and southeastern boundary, secured to us by articles of compact contained in the ordinance of 1787, and which, if acceded to by the people of Michigan, would deprive us of all jurisdiction over the waters of Lake Erie, and gratuitously bestow on Ohio the exclusive jurisdic

tion on the waters of said lake, from the Pennsylvania line to the mouth of the Detroit river, a gift, the extent of which, we believe, neither congress nor the state of Ohio fully comprehended, and have required the people of this state to give' their assent to the aforesaid change of boundaries, by a convention of delegates to be by them elected: AND WHEREAS, This convention, taking into consideration the just rights of Michigan, as respects her southern and southeastern boundary, and also her constitution, embracing that part of our territory claimed by Ohio, and believing that the assent required by the said proviso cannot be given by us without a palpable violation of our constitution, which provides the only way in which it can be amended, and over which this convention has no control, without a sacrifice of our rights and interests, and without committing an act of self degradation, Therefore Resolved, That this convention cannot give their assent to the proposition contained in said proviso, but the same is hereby rejected by a vote of 28 to 21." A few thoughts on the closing act of the drama of our admission into the Union, and I am done. The only convention invested with any authority by Congress, or by the legislature of the state to act upon the proviso for the admission of Michigan, having been emphatically rejected by the convention, and Gov. Mason having been requested to call another convention, and declining on the ground that he had no legal authority to,do so, several self constituted leaders called for an appointment of delegates to meet at Ann Arbor on the 14th day of December, 1836, and on that day met according to appointment, and, without delay, unanimously voted to accept the conditions imposed by Congress. Judge Cooley calls it an irregular convention. It is hardly entitled to be called a convention, it was at the time called "The frost-bitten convention." I have made persistent efforts, by correspondence with the secretary of state, to find out what number of voters took part in the election of delegates to the convention ordered by Congress, and also how many took part in the frost-bitten convention, and have this from the secretary, that the returns from the December election were very imperfect from the counties, some of them making none at all. I "find by examination of the records of Oakland, that at the election of delegates to the September convention, 2,200 votes were given, and for delegates to the December gathering, only 570 voters took part, and from personal knowledge, and the best information I have been able to obtain, but a small minority of all the voters took part, not over twenty five per cent, I am sure, and yet these delegates assumed to accept the changed boundaries of the state. The proceedings of the meeting were at once forwarded to Washington, although I 'have not found any record of their action here at home, Judge Cooley says the authorities at Washington pretended to be satisfied with this, and declared the state admitted to the Union with its present boundaries. Col. A. T. McReynolds, in his address at the semi-centennial, says, "It should be remembered in this connection, that Ohio was at the time an administra

tion state, with nineteen voting members on the floor of the house, while Michigan had not one." It is possible that this fact may account for the prompt action of Congress in the admission of Michigan, on the assumption of delegates claiming to represent Michigan, yet without any proper authority. I believe I have shown to the satisfaction of the pioneers, that Michigan was admitted into the Union on the false pretense by Congress that they were satisfied, and the further fact that, Michigan never gave the assent required by the act of Congress of June 15, 1836. These two important facts make a prominent item in the history of Michbigan. Some one may say, admitting your statement to be correct, what are wegoing to do about it? To which I answer, nothing whatever. I have given the facts; let Congress and Ohio have all the credit of the transaction. We are recognized as in the Union, and, while our coming in was such an outrage as was never perpetrated on any other infant state, we may indulge the hope that if any of the members of Congress are still living, who exacted of Michigan so illegal and unreasonable conditions for. our admission, will, ere they cross the river, repent in sackcloth and, ashes. A few words in conclusion in a more cheerful strain. The birth of Michigan was after prolonged labor, and surmounting many obstacles, but we have passed safely through them, or around them, and through the tenderyears of infancy, and of childhood and youth, and many years'since arrived at stalwart manhood. Within the recollection of some of us (in 1830) the population of Michigan was 31,649, and now in 1887 it is two millions or over and the developments and improvements of the fifty years since our admission to the Union, have been at least equal, if not greater in all departments than that of the increase in population; and the resources have become more varied than those of any other state in the Union, and more than abundant in quantity. Our resources in lumber, salt, iron, copper, silver and gold, plaster and coal in great abundance, added to this an eminently fertile soil, producing to the agriculturist princely returns for all hia labor, and producing, also, all the delicious fruits of this latitude, in their variety and abundantly; with a healthful climate, surrounded by navigable waters, rendering transportation of productions to market cheap and promptly reached, give us facilities not enjoyed by more inland states. I1 must not omit to mention the educational interests of Michigan in which she is pre-eminent; her university, her colleges, theological, literary, and agricultural, her normal and high schools, her provision for the unfortunate, the blind, deaf, dumb, and insane, her reformatory system for all classes,, justly entitle her to commendation. Fifty or sixty years ago, and within the recollection, and during the resi

A VISIT TO LAKE SUPERIOR. 161 denuce here of some of us, Michigan was largely dependent on Ohio for provisions, for beef, pork, flour, butter, etc., but now and for many years, that state of dependence has been changed for one of independence. Now Ohio is dependent on Michigan for her lumber supply; her home supply for salt having failed, she is obliged to come to Michigan for her supply of that very necessary article, and the same is true of Indiana, who was interested with Ohio in robbing us when we were in embryo. In view then, of our advantages as briefly alluded to, our extended and abundant resources, the rapid growth of our state in population, and in all the elements of prosperity, and permanent improvements, our freedom as a state from debt, and enjoying so largely the blessings which our beneficent Creator has lavished upon us, may we not cherish a just pride in the reflection that we are citizens and pioneers of so noble and prosperous a state. RECOLLECTIONS OF THE EARLY EXPLORATIONS AND DISCOVERY OF IRON ORE ON LAKE SUPERIOR. "BY PHILO M. EVERETT. In 1844 the copper interest of Lake Superior got to fever heat, especially in Boston, by the reports of Professor Jackson, of Boston. A friend of his in Detroit, whom I was then doing business with, gave me the history of Jackson's work in exploring on the shores of Lake Superior, and in the spring of 1845 I determined to visit Lake Superior and see for myself, if possible, what all that talk amounted to. I proposed to some of my friends to join me in a speculation of that nature, and I soon collected thirteen members. The association papers were made out and signed by all the members, and our company was called the Jackson Mining Company of Jackson, Michigan. I then sent to our Senator at Washington, Mr. Norvel, asking him to procure a number of permits from the Secretary of War, giving permission to locate a mile square each any where on the south shore of Lake Superior, for mining purposes, and as the season was advancing I made ready at once to leave for 21

Lake Superior on receipt of my permits. Our permits were issued on the 16th of June, 1845, and I believe that was the last day permits were ever issued, the transaction of the Secretary of War being declared illegal; but Congress legalized the act and gave permission for any person to locate a mile square on the south shore of Lake Superior by leaving a person in charge of the locoLtion. I received our permits on the 19th of June, and on the 20th of June, 1845, I left my home in Jackson for Lake Superior, bought my supplies in Detroit, and took a steamer for Mackinaw, as there was no boat then running direct to the Sault as now. I purchased a coasting boat at Mackinaw and put it on board the General Scott, a small side wheel steamer, making three trips a week from Mackinaw to the Sault. It was said no boat could go up the Sault river then, drawing over nine feet of water. I was somewhat surprised on arriving at the Saplt to find such an immense warehouse for traffic with the Indians of the northwest. My first duty was to transport my coasting boat over the portage of three quarters of a mile and ship the most of my supplies to Copper Harbor, that being copper headquarters. We struck our tent at the head of the portage preparing for a start. The next thing in order was to procure a coaster, one that was familiar with the lake. The thought of coasting along the rocky and desolate shores of Lake Superior, not knowing at any time what we were to meet with next, was not a pleasing one, especially in passing the pictured rocks. It was well known that there were long stretches of coast there where no boat could land and that Lake Superior often got very angry in a few minutes. Louis Nolan was recommended to me as the best man for that purpose in the Sault. He was a large, stout man, well acquainted with the lake and all the northwest. I found him engaged with a trader gathering in fish. He was a little over six feet high, well proportioned, a Frenchman with a slight mixture of Indian blood, with an intelligent countenance and pleasant address, and very polite. I made my business known and inquired if he was well acquainted with the lake. He replied that he had coasted the length of the lake many times, on both sides, and also had traveled many times to Hudson's Bay and had been employed by the fur company for many years as a clerk. Now we think of a clerk as one sitting in any easy chair in a warm office, writing at a desk; but a fur company's clerk is quite a different thing. He must be able to write a fair hand, be a good accountant, and be able to take a ninety pound pack on his back and travel all day from one Indiam camp to another, collecting furs and living entirely on wild meat, mostly rabbits, for the fur companies only supplied bread food enough to last their clerks to headquarters. The ninety pound pack consists of Indian goods, and that is the standard weight of all fur *companies' packs. Knowing thesefacts

INCIDENTS AT TE SAULT. 163 before I was at once satisfied he was the man for us. He made a proposition for the season to pilot, pack and cook for us. The bargain was then concluded, but he wanted two days in which to prepare for the summer trip. It was granted. He now remarked: "You say you are going to Copper Harbor for copper ore; you don't want to go to Copper Harbor for.ore, there is plenty at Carp River. There is more ore back of Carp River (now Marquette) up at Teal Lake than you can ever get away-two mountains of itonly two or three miles apart." I inquired what kind of ore it was. "Don't know much about ore;" and having a few specimens of ore with me, I spread them out and requested him to point out the ore like the ore at Teal Lake. He shook his head, putting his finger on a piece of Galena lead ore saying that was the most like it, but that wasn't it. "It looks like rock, but it wasn't rock, several bowlders lay beside the trail, worn smooth, and shined brightly." "When did you see this ore last?" I inquired. "Thirty six years ago I went from Carp River to Menominee with some Indians, and never having seen anything like it, I distinctly remember it." "How old are you?" "Most sixty." His description of the ore two or three miles further on was equally surprising. The trail ran along the north side of a bluff, fifty feet high, of solid ore. This description greatly surprised me, for I learned he was a christian man of the Roman Catholic faith, was perfectly truthful and reliable, never used profane language and never got drunk. What could it be? It was not copper, that was evident, for I showed him copper specimens, and that was not it, as he termed it. I had never heard of iron in this district, and therefore thought nothing of its being iron. Now, as I had two days to wait, I took a stroll about the town. Passing down the portage, I noticed several canoes in the rapids, two Indians in each canoe, standing erect as steadily as if on land. I watched them for several hours, for I had never seen or heard of such a way of taking fish. The man in front soon dipped in his scoop net and took out a large whitefish. It was strange to see how that frail bark canoe could be shot into the foaming rapids, as white as milk, and could be managed by that Indian. The forward one, when he saw a fish, would lay down his setting pole, take up his scoop net, dip up his fish, and again take up his setting pole with surprising ease, and the canoe would again be shot into the foaming rapids still further. Few white men could stand erect in this canoe a single moment. I sat on the shore for a long time, scarcely thinking of the passing hours. "I next visited the fort, a beautiful site for a city-such a handsome plat of ground of every side. Not far from the fort was the Baptist mission, under the charge of Rev. -Mr. Bingham, a very pleasant gentleman. He told me he went on board of a schooner at Buffalo, with his family, bound for the Sault,

COASTING-TEAL LAKE.

if I remember rightly, in 1833, to take charge of the mission: Ho had a lovely family-his girls were like roses in a wilderness. He told me much of his labors with the Indians; he thought he had done them much good, and I had no doubt of it. He had taught them to read and write, and from my long acquaintance with the Indians in Oneida county, New York, where they had every facility for school and church, I knew that was about all that could be made of them. They seem to lack a capacity for anything further. After they get that far, as soon as they are out of school they will join a dog feast, according to the old Indian custom. But the two days were now wearing away. Louis reported at our tent for duty with his pack of blankets and tent cloth, together with a shot gun, having the appearance of being manufactured in Queen Anne's time, but it was a deadly weapon, dangerous at both ends, as one of our party could testify a few days afterwards. He ventured to fire it at some game, was knocked sprawling on the ground, and went with a lame shoulder for, many days. He said it kicked like a mule. No one of our company had the courage to fire it afterwards during the whole summer. We were not long in finding out that we had made a wise choice in our coaster. He knew every point and every stream that entered the.lake. When it came time to camp, he would run the boat ashore at the mouth of a stream where we could catch all the speckled trout we wanted for supper and breakfast. He never left his seat on the stern of the boat. When we sailed, he steered, and when we rowed he paddled and steered. He was supplied with trolling line, as well as gun. The first day I said to him, "Oan't you'catch some trout by trolling?" "No trout here; too much sand beach," he said; but one day as we were passing a rocky point he took out his trolling line, saying, "May be we can catch trout here." He threw out his line and a big trout took it before the hook was twenty feet from the stern of the boat, and I saw several others after it. He took in several fine ones in a few minutes and went to winding up his line. I asked him to let me take it and catch a lot. I shall never forget the look he gave me, saying; "What you want of them? you have now more than we can eat; do you wish to waste the Indians' food?" That was a break-down argument. I admitted he was right, and said no more. On arriving at Teal Lake, we found the ore just as he had described it. Tthere lay the boulders of the trail, made smooth by the atmosphere, bright and shining, but dark colored, and a perpendicular bluff fifty feet in height, of pure solid ore, looking like rock, but not rock, and on climbing a steep elevation of about seventy feet, the ore cropping out in different places all the way, we came, at the top, to a precipice many feet deep. Hundreds of

tons of ore that bad been thrown down by the frost lay at the bottom. It was solid ore, but much leaner than that on the other side. From all that could be seen, it seemed that the whole elevation for half a mile or more was one solid mass of iron ore. No rock could be seen, and all that visited it came to the same conclusion, until the mine was fairly opened. By measurement, the outcrop was found to be three quarters of a mile southwest of the southeast corner of Teal Lake. The other outcrop, two miles further on, was a beautiful sight. On the north side of the hill it was a pependicular bluff of about fifty feet of pure iron ore and jasper in alternate streaks, but more jasper than iron. Another small outcrop appeared a mile further on, for several years known as the little location (now known as Lake Superior mine). With all its beauty, that high bluff proved worthless; but the Cleveland mine, near by, only a few rods from its base, was soon discovered, and proved one of the best mines in the country. On arriving at Copper Harbor, I found the government mineral office on the island opposite the harbor, which in fact formed the harbor. The white tents on the island appeared like an army encampment. Presenting my permit and description, the officer looked it over, saying, " Where is Teal lake? It is not on my map." I told him the Indians called it twenty five miles southwest of Carp river, and it took us a day and a half to go there. That was all I knew about it. He said to me: " Mark the lake on the map." I refused to do so, saying that it might work us an injury, as it was pretty certain to be wrong. He measured off twenty five miles on his map and marked out Teal lake with our permit on the south side, as given in the description. I did not lay a permit on what is now known as the Cleveland, believing, as Louis said, we had all the ore we could ever get away, of the very best quality and nearer the lake, preferring to let some other party take it and help to open the country. I had only seen this kind of rock ore once before. That was twenty miles from Black river in Oneida county, New York, between that place and Lake Champlain. That ore was precisely the same as the specular ore of Lake Superior. At Copper Harbor I met Professor Shepard, of New Haven, Connecticut, and I showed him the iron. He said it was as fine ore as he had ever seen, but thought it nearly worthless as it was so far away; it would be like lifting a weight at the end of a ten foot pole. But when I parted (with him in the fall he said he had thought much about that iron, and believed I had better take care of it; the time might come when it would be worth something. I We made explorations in various directions, locating several permits about Houghton, but never paid any attention to them afterwards, turning our

whole attention to the iron. Louis had seen several pieces of copper. in the hands of Vieux Desert Indians, but could not ascertain where they got them. Thinking there must be copper in that vicinity, I determined to go there and settle the matter, if possible, and left Copper Harbor with that intent. We ran ashore at the Catholic Mission at L'Anse. Several Indians met us at the landing and all knew Louis. It was soon noised about that Louis had come, and I believe all the squaws, old and young, came rushing down to meet him,. joy beaming all over their faces. They all seemed to be meeting a loved father. They all bade him welcome with a warm kiss; it was really a pleasant sight. It was Saturday and we intended to spend Sunday there. We pitched opr tent and moved our things into it. Several of the Indians came and seated themselves in the tent. Among them was a very old Indian but in full vigor, and about as homely a face as could well be conceived. I saw he had his eyes on our little vinegar keg most of the time. I asked Louis in a whisper what the old fellow thought was in it. He replied: "Brandy; can't you give him some?" "Yes, yes," was the reply. I bought that vinegar in Detroit, the very strongest to be got; no one could use it without watering it. The color was precisely like brandy. Louis took a cup, drew out a little, and handed it to the old Indian. He took one swallow. I was frightened, for I thought I had been the cause of killing the old fellow. His face was about as ugly as it could be, naturally, but such a contortion I never, saw before. After a time he began to get his breath, and when the other Indians saw hewas not dead they set up such a boisterous laugh as I never heard from Indians before. I expected the old fellow would be fighting mad, but when he got his breath, so he could, he seemed to enjoy the joke. Louis asked him if he would have'some more brandy; the answer was quick and sharp-"Kah win" (No!). I attended the mission church with Louis on Sunday; the services were conducted by Bishop Baraga, the singing was by Indian women and was. very good. Monday morning we again started out for the forest. The rockssouthwest of L'Anse, beyond the Sturgeon, have a very singular appearance,. of a reddish cast and streaked with white quartz, but we fcund no mineral. When we arrived within half a day's march of Vieux D.sert it was storming, half snow and half rain, making the bushes wet, so we camped on the trail' about noon, pitched our tent and built a big fire to dry ourselves as well as to get our dinner. After dinner Louis said he would go and get some ducks. In the afternoon several Indians came from the payment at La Pointe and camped near us. An Indian never builds much of a fire, but they like a fire as well as a white man. One Indian, with a wife and boy, pitched his blanket tent opposite our fire, the others near by. A little before dark Louis came

INCIDENTS-LOCATING. 167 in with twenty two ducks and two geese-quite a load. I told Louis to give the geese to the Indians, as the ducks were as much as we could eat before they would spoil. He gave one to the family opposite our fire and the woman dressed it, cut it up and put into their camp kettle, boiled it a short time, and then the two, with the boy, ate the whole goose. Our ducks were so fat we could not eat them without roasting out the fat before the fire. In the middle of the night I heard a groaning and vomiting; it was the Indian opposite our fire. I asked Louis what was the matter. His answer was: "Do' know, Indian very sick, guess he going to die." It struck me it was raw goose. I said to Louis, " Have his wife make some very strong coffee out of the corn, and give him one swallow every five or ten minutes." I got up and watched to see if she did it right. She made it very nicely and commenced giving it to him as directed. In a few minutes tile vomiting ceased, and in about half an hour his groans ceased also. Id the morning I enquired of Louis how the Indian was. "Going to get well," was the reply; "they say you are a great medicine man." About noon the woman packed up and took the whole camp equipment on her back and left for home, the Indian following. As the weather had cleared up and the bushes began to dry, we packed up and moved also. This was the 20th of September. The Indians make great use of the wild rice growing in those lakes, sometimes in ten feet of water. It looks like a rye field, and the kernel is like rye, but only about two thirds the size. It is gathered mostly by the women, one pushing the canoe while the other bends the rice over the side of the canoe with a crooked stick similar to a sickle, and strikes it with a sharp knife, and the heads drop into the canoe. The ducks and geese stay here in large numbers until the ice drives them away. We found many pieces of copper in the hands of the Indians, but they seemed to be handed down from one to the other until no one could tell where they came from. These Indians were a filthy, dirty set of people. Louis called them "wild Indians." I saw no sign that they ever washed their clothes, and don't believe they ever did. Dirty clothes was not all they had on, as we could testify. When we returned to Lake Superior our flannel had to have a thorough boiling. The season of navigation on Lake Superior was now drawing to a close, and I turned my face towards home. In the winter of 1845 and '46 I learned that the township lines about Teal lake had been run in the summer of 1844. Towards spring two of our company, Col. Berry and Kirkland, offered to go up the lake in the spring, if the company would pay their expenses, hunt up the town lines, and go to the mineral office and locate Teal lake correctly; their offer was accepted, and they were instructed, if they met with a party they had confidence in, who would

On the opening of navigation in 1846, they left for Lake Superior; on their way up they fell in with a Cleveland party that promised everything required. They were shown what is known as the Cleveland mine, and, in due time, a man was placed in charge to keep the location, according to the act of Congress. Berry and Kirkland found the township corner only a few rods from the southeast corner of Teal lake. Our boundary started at the southeast corner of Teal lake. Three quarters of a mile southwest was the outcrop of ore, making that the-center of the section; this was now known as the northeast corner of town 47 north, range 27 west, and section 1. Then they went to Copper Harbor and had Teal lake correctly placed on the mineral map, more than twelve miles from where it was first laid down. Soon after they returned to Jackson. I went with several persons of the company to an old forge called Ilodunk, a few miles north of Coldwater, Michigan, taking with me some of our iron ore. This forge was run on bog ore, Mr. Olds being the forge man and William Lemm the helper. They took our ore and made a bar of iron from it in our presence. On returning home to Jackson I took the bar of iron to John A. Bailey, then a resident of Jackson. He converted it into steel and made a knife blade on one end, and ground it thin like a razor. It would cut hickory bark without turning the edge. It was as fine stuff as I ever saw in any instrument. Having settled the fact that the iron was of the very best quality, we at once set about preparing to build a small forge to bring out the iron and make it known. Men were hired and sent up to build a dwelling and warehouse at the landing, build a wagon road to the mine, and a dwelling at the mine. I found it difficult to hire men, because they were afraid of suffering with the cold, believing they would freeze to death in that cold region. We hired a man from Pennsylvania, a forge builder, to go up and put up a forge on Carp river, two and a half miles east of the mine; his name was McNair. We had him made postmaster, calling the office Carp River postoffice. The forgo started making iron in the winter of 1847 and 1848. The spring freshets in April took away part of the dam, and, on the opening of navigation, McNair came to Jackson. We settled with him and he returned to his home in Pennsylvania, and I went up the lake to repair the dam and build a saw mill. This was in the spring of 1848. Robert Graveraet, Samuel Moody and Mann arrived there before me, and went on up to the mines, and, in the absence of the man in charge of the Cleveland location, burned the building the Cleveland company hal built, and built one of their own, and gave out that they would shoot the man in charge if he attempted to return to take

169

possession. After their building was completed, Graveraet returned below. A few days after I landed there, John Burt, with a company of surveyors, landed, Mr. Burt having a contract to survey out several townships of land west of the forge. He packed his supplies past the forge and the Cleveland to the "little location," as it was called. Believing the little location was worth taking care of, he put up a building there and made it his general depot for supplies, and from there supplied his surveyors west. When his surveying job was finished in the fall, Mr. Burt left two of his men in charge of the location to remain there all winter. Soon after I arrived at the forge, I received the appointment of postmaster in place of DMcNair, resignel. Shortly after the arrival of John Burt, Mr. Foster, of the firm of Foster & Whitney, came and wanted all the information I could give Aim about the iron. I found that our men had rambled over the country quite a long distance, as far as what is now known as the Republic mine. I gave him the description of that location, as well as many others. He went and made thorough examination of the mine, and when he returned he told me it was a bigger thing than the Jackson mine. That was hard to believe, for we thought the Jackson could not be beaten. Next came Alexander Sibley, of Rochester, New York. He came up the lake on the schooner Furtrader, sailed by Capt. Ripley. We had a contract with Capt. Ripley for our freighting and he ugually called on his way up and down the lake, and promised to call on his way down for him. Mr. Sibley told me his business was to purchase the Jackson mine and property, if it suited him. I had a couple of horses saddled and rode out with him to the mine. He examined the bluff at the foot of the elevation very closely and evidently with much surprise. We then began to climb the hill; he looked closely at the iron outcrops as we went up. When about half way up he stopped, saying he had gone far enough. I remonstrated; told him there was a big bluff on the top of the hill where a hundred tons or more of ore had been thrown down by the frost. He replied it was of no use to himthere was too much of it. "You say," said he, "tbere are two more mines two or three miles further on, and here is ore enough to supply the Uuited States for all time to come. This hill is one solid mass of the richest iron ore for half a mile and how much more no one knows; it will only be worth the digging." We came back without making any further examination. I entertained him until the Fartrader returned, and he went back to Rochester, went into the telegraph business, made a fortune and was called the Telegraph king of Rochester. He was a very intelligent, pleasant gentleman, but the iron was too much for him; he would not touch it; if there had been less he would have bought it out. 22

SPECULATION-TRESPASSING.

Next came Mr. Jones, my neighbor, of Jackson. He was not a stockholder, but hearing so much said about the iron mountain -he determined to see it himself; he spent several weeks with me. When he returned to Jackson he began buying up the Jackson stock, and got enough to elect himnseif president of the company. The Republic mine lay subject to entry for quite a number of years, because it was a long way off, with a very rough country to traverse to get to it, and without a railroad it was worthless. I never expected to live to see a railroad to the Jackson mine. Several years after this Silas C. Smith and Dr. J. J. St. Clair entered the Republic mine. In the winter of 1818-'49 Robert Graveraet went to Mr. Clark, of Massachusetts, an I represented to him that the controlling stock of the Jackson Mining Company could be bought very easily. Mr. Clark was not a capitalist but a kind of speculator. lie induced Mr. Fisher, a heavy cotton manufacturer of Massachusetts, to furnish the money to buy out the Jackson, or the controlling stock, and let him manage the concern. A. Rf. Harlow had a small machine shop, and he agreed to put that into the company and move on and take charge of it as a member of the company. Now all was ready by the opening of navigation. Clark and Harlow came on to Detroit and purchased a large stock of supplies in the way of eatables, but no tools or teams were bought, as they were totake possession of the Jackson Company and all that belonged to it. They did not wait to see if they could get the stock, but shipped their supplies on to Marquette with Mr. Barlow and his family; Graveraot was also one of the company. Clark went to Jackson to get control of the stock, as he had been told it was an easy affair. Graveraet and Harlow with their supplies arrived at our landing in Marquette while I was at the forge, and took possession of our dwelling, expecting to get possession of the forge and all things thereunto belonging, together with the mine, in a few days. When I came down to the lake on business, I had to seek quarters with the Indians or sleep out of doors. Clark went to Jackson from Detroit to purchase the controlling stock, of the Jackson, but Mr. Jones learned what was going on and got the control of the stock in his own hands, s8 that when Clark came there he soon found he was foiled. IHe returned to Detroit and took the first steamer for Lake Superior. When he reached Marquette he found things decidedly flat; they were there with a large supply of provisions, but no tools or teams and no laborers, and were trespassers. They held a council, and determined to go ahead and build a forge of their own at the shore; they built a log building for their supplies, and went to Dead river, took down a log dwelling that was there, brought it to Marquette, put it up near where the Cleveland dock now stands, and vacated our building. They were in want of men, so Clark left for Milwaukee, hired

forty men, French and Germans, and put them on a sail vessel for Marquette. At the Sault he stopped off and was taken with the cholera and died in a few days. Graveraet and Harlow set the men cutting coal wood. It was curious to see them chop; never having used an ax, they clinched the handle of the ax tight and held on, not slipping either hand. In cutting down a tree, they chopped all around the tree, and when weakened so as to fall, it went the way it leaned. There were forty men in a huddle, and when the tree started a yell was given so that every one could run for his life. To chop off a log they stood on the ground, if the log was ever so large. But the little machine shop went up, and brick making and building went on. About this time the Cleveland company represented to the commissioner of the land office at Washington in what manner Graveraet, Moody and Mann had taken and retained possession of their mine, and the commissioner awarded the mine to the Cleveland company. When Moody and Mann heard of the result they packed up and joined the Marquette company at the lake. When the land about Marquette came into Inarket John Burt appeared at the land office at the Sault to enter his "little location," but Graveraet opposed him'so sharply that Burt settled the matter by giving him half of the mining right. Mr. Jones came up to take charge of the Jackson property in the latter part of the summer of 1819, and Charles Johnson and myself left for Jackson. While at the Sault we entered what is now known as the thirty six acre plat, in the city of Marquette, but yielded one half interest to the Cleveland company. That entry covered the land where the M. II. & 0. merchandise dock, the great ore dock, and the Iron Bay furnace now stand. I spent the winter of 1849 and '50 in Jackson, and in the summer of 1850 disposed of my warehouse and some other property, together with my Jackson mining company interest, and in the fall prepared to move my family to Marquette. I left my dwelling to be rented, and most of my furniture to be sold, and Charles Johnson and myself and families left for Lake Superior. We boarded with A. N. Barney, who kept a sort of'hotel on the ground where the Nothwestern hotel afterwards stood. W6 soon finished off a small one story dwelling of two rooms and four small bel rooms on the ground floor, where the Burt block was afterwards built. That building was removed to give place for the Bart block and placed on the west side of the manufacturing shop, as a paint shop, on Main street, about half way from Front street to the first depot of Marquette. That building escaped the great fire of 1868, which took every building I had in Marquette, and every building on Front street from Superior to Michigan street. Mr. Jones' management of the Jackson mine and forge was not very profit

able. He got more on his hands than he could carry. S. H. Kimball and General Curtiss, with other New York friends, bought up most of the stock; they leased the forge and mine to two brothers, Benjamin and Weston Eaton, of Pennsylvania, and they came on and took possession, bringing with them teams and supplies; but they found that four horse teams in this snowy country would not work. The snow path would not hold up more than what one team could haul. They made iron and carried on the works two or three years and then failed, losing all they had. The Graveraet and Harlow company went on making bloom iron for two or three years, but it did not succeed as they expected. Fisher became tired of furnishing money and nearly failed himself, having furnished over sixty thousand dollars. They finally failed and turned over their entire property to the Cleveland company. It was now evident to both the Jackson and Cleveland companies that there was no money in making iron in an old fashioned forge, and 'they turned their attention to shipping the ore. In the spring of 1852, I went to the Sault, and met Heman B. Ely, with his engineers, coming to Marquette, for the purpose of surveying a railroad from Marquette to the mines, having made a contract with the Jackson and Cleveland mining companies to transport their iron ore from the mines to the lake at a much less figure than the ore has ever been carried since. His contract did not specify when the road should be finislled, but it was to be pushed as fast as he could do it. The survey went on, and he built a dwelling, which is now a part of the Ely house, near Whetstone brook, and an office near by. The work progressed slowly bat surely; after a time, the companies became impatient at his slow progress,.but his reply was; "I am doing as fast as I can pay up." (He always paid promptly). But the Sault canal was to be built, and the companies were anxious to be in readiness to ship ore. Finally the Jackson company brought on some supplies for commencing a plank road, and the Cleveland company joined them. It was said the move was made to frighten Ely so as to surrender to them. Ely didn't frighten, however, but kept steadily digging away. The parties had several meetings in my parlor. Ely said to them that he was doing as fast as he had means, but if they would furnish him the money he would push it on as fast as possible. They said to him, they would take the controlling stock and furnish the money. This he refused, but said he would let them have just one half and no more. That they would not do, and the meeting broke up. The plank road was begun and pushed with vigor, but the two companies soon collided, the plank road getting on to Ely's line,, that was on record, and there were several suits between them in the District court. The

ore companies had Mr. Walker, of Detroit, but Ely was his own lawyer, and Ely always came out ahead. The plank road took possession of the wagon road whenever it was convenient, and in some places where teams could not get around the place they were obliged to travel on the plank road. One Saturday night Mr. Ely sent to the stable 'for his teamster, Plumtree, a burly Frenchman; when he came Mr. Ely said to him, he wanted him to take a load of supplies up to his men at the Eagle Mills in the morning. Plumtree said Iimrod had put up several gates on the plank road at points where a team could not get around them and had put locks on them, and they were all locked up that afternoon. Mr. Ely was a rather slow and deliberate speaker; he said, "Mr. Plumtree, I want you to take a load of supplies tomorrow morning to my men at the mills, never mind the gates." This was spoken in such an emphatic tone Plumtree seemed to understand it and said, "Yes, yes; I will do it." Sunday morning Plumtree loaded up his team, taking his ax along with him. That was no unusual thing, for most of the teamsters in that day carried an ax to use in case of accident. He took the load up and returned. Monday morning there was quite a commotion in the plank road camp. Some one had cut down all the gates and thrown them off the road. Parties were at once sent out to find out who dared to cut down Himrod's gates. They brought word that no one but Plumtree with Ely's team could be heard of. He had been seen going up and back, but no one else had been seen on the road, and there was no doubt that he was the man. Mr. Plumtree was promptly arrested upon a warrant for cutting down the gates, and brought before the court, Mr. Ely appearing for Plumtree. Several witnesses were produced and proved beyond a doubt that Plumtree went up the road and back with Ely's team, but no one saw him cut down the gates, and the court discharged the prisoner. The gates were never put up again. The plank road was finished and the strap rail laid in 1855. I took the contract for excavating what is known as the Jackson cut, in the winter of 1855-6. The Sault canal was to be opened in the spring, and the owners of the plank road were anxious to be ready to ship ore. I was obliged to work night and day to have it ready at the opening of navigation. The bed of the cut was twenty feet wide, with sloping banks. All was completed in due time, and the track laid through it onto their dock where the Grace furnace now stands. The canal at the Sault was opened early in the summer and forty or fifty mule teams landed at Marquette. They were put to hauling ore from the mines, but it was soon found the road was a failure. Generally the teams did not reach Marquette from the mines until 12 o'clock at night. Some one of them would break down, and that would hinder all behind it. They had

no turn-outs, so as to pass each other and it was difficult to pass on one track, as has been found by all railroads. They divided their teams, stationing one half at the mines, meeting at Eagle mills; but the road was a failure. More ore could have been hauled on wagons without the rail. In this summer Ely landed the " Sabastapol," the first locomotive ever landed on this shore. In 1856 a grant of land was made by Congress to aid in the construction of railroads from Marquette and Ontonagon to the state line, which included the road from Marquette to the mines. Senator Sumner was at my house the year before, and he said to me that whenever Lake Superior needed anything from Congress, if I would write him, he would do all he could for us. When this land grant was asked for, I wrote him, asking him to do what he could for it, which he cheerfully did. IIeman B. Ely died in the fall of 1856, but the railroad was pushed through, and completed to the mines in the following summ6r. In the winter of 1857 I was in Cleveland, and the Elys telegraphed me to charter a vessel to take a locomotive from Buff.ilo to Marquette in the spring. I was greatly surprised to find that there were only two vessels large enough, the E. C. Roberts and the De Soto. I chartered the E. C. Roberts, which was then in Buffalo. I left Detroit for Marquette the first- day of IMay, 1857, on the steamer North Star, and did not arrive at Marquette until the third of June. The steamer had to force her way through ice for six or eight miles. The last piece of ice was seen floating in the bay on the morning of the third day of July, 1857. A company of men to commence the pioneer furnace came on that steamer. That summer Dr. Ely came to take the place of his brother Heman in building and running the railroad. When the locomotive reached Eagle Mills, the ore companies made arrangements with Dr. Ely to take their ore at the mills, while they delivered it that far with mules. After the locomotive reached the mines the ore was all shipped over the railroad. The mules were sent away, the strap rail taken up, and the plank road was aban-. doned to the public and made a very fine wagon road. From this time the ore companies made money rapidly, mining and shipping ore. The "Little Location," as it was first called (now known as the Lake Superior Mine), in 1886, just thirty years from the start, produced over two hundred thousand tons of ore. The whole product of the Lake Superior iron mines, in 1886, was three million, four hundred and sixty thousand tons.

LIFE IN THE COPPER MINES OF LAKE SUPERIOR. BY JOHN H. FORSTER. Mining in the upper peninsula of Michigan is not essentially different from mining elsewhere. But when we contrast this leading industry with those pursuits which engage the attention of the busy people of the lower peninsula of the same commonwealth, there are so many radical differences in modes, customs and habits, that it may not be out of place, nor opposed to the general purposes of this society, if I attempt to place before you some of the more marked peculiarities of the upper country. This paper is in the same line as those which I have already had the honor of reading before this society. In those papers it was my desire and aim to give a general description of the so called Lake Superior country in connection with pioneer settlement in that interesting section. The pioneer miner found that vast territory, washed by the great lake, a dense forest land. The timber was heavy and the underbrush so thick and tangled as to resemble a jungle. This dense growth was a very great hindrance to preliminary exploration and a most serious obstacle at the beginning of a mine enterprise. Consequently, the first thing to be done in opening a mine was with ax and firebrand, to ruthlessly sweep off the native forest to prepare the way for the miner's cabin, the shaft and engine house. No thought of agriculture-the cultivation of the soil thus laid bare-was entertained by these sturdy pioneers. Worshipers of the subterranean god, Pluto, they held, as they now do, the attractions of those gentle goddesses, Ceres and Pomona, in small esteem. The pick, hamnmr and drill were their potent weapons in their attacks upon the earth's solid crust. Mining for copper and iron was their sole business; all of their energies were expended thereupon. The progress made was slow. They encountered many difficulties, met with many discouragements, endured many privations. Vast sums of money were expended; there were successes and failures. Buried in the depths of the woods, remote from other settlements, with no society except that of the rudest kind, living in huts, with only the necessaries of life at command, often on short rations, without newspapers, and with a letter mail arriving

BEGINNING A MINE.

monthly by dog train, if the weather favored, the educated young pioneer found himself in a trying situation, aggravated in the winter season by the deep snows which rendered exercise, except on snow shoes, difficult, with short days and long nights and intense cold. Without the stimulus of companionship and conversation it was not to be wondered at if he fell into despondency. As has been truly observed by more than one student of human nature, those persons who have been reared in the woods, on the frontier, acquire a grave cast of character verging upon deep melancholy. And no wonder; for the' deep solemnity of the forests, the dangers and privations of their lot, all tend to make them so. After the discovery of a lode or vein,-a difficult matter in itself,preparations were at once made to work it, or in other words, to open the mine. The first preliminary operation was to make a clearing large enough to make room for a few miners' cabins, a shop or two, the engine and shaft houses. The embryo town was built among the charred stumps without order, on dry ground if possible, among drift boulders or knobs of trap. It often happened that the lode to be worked passed under a cedar swamp, wet and tangled. This added to the difficulty of the situation as well as the gloom of the place, for the swamp had to be drained and filled up with rock and other debris to make a foundation for the mine buildings. Some of the finest and largest towns in the upper peninsula were built in cedar swamps, upon piles and rock filling. The city of Ishpeming is a notable example of this sort. Scarcely less difficult was it to build where the erratic boulders, from a few pounds to many tons in weight, strewed the ground so thickly as to leave not a square yard of clear space. At Michigamme when the beautiful maple woods had been stripped from the land, and burnt, it was a ghastly sight to see hundreds of acres of granite and quartz boulders mingled with masses of iron ore covering the ground, reminding one of a graveyard in ruins. In one sense it was a graveyard, for this boulder drift was no other than the wreck of preexisting formations, disrupted and transported by glacial currents. Thus, among stump and rocks, our mine hamlet struggles forward. A road has to be cut out to the nearest water. Like all roads in the woods in a new country it is rough and crooked. The primitive corduroy so familiar to pioneers is one of its characteristic features. Thd terrible jolting one received while passing over it in a lumber wagon is not remembered with unalloyed satisfaction. But this was preferable to wallowing hub deep through mud and mire. The task of hauling supplies and machinery over such roads was herculean. The pedestrian had an easier way, following a winding trail over the new-fallen leaves. But his journey was by no means

THE OLD PACKER-THE MINE.

a holiday. In the absence of horses or oxen he was called upon to pack in on his back provisions, steel and powder. He would shoulder a package of 100 pounds or so and make light of a journey of ten or twenty miles a day. An old packer would often carry a barrel of pork or fish, placed in bags, in this way. He carried his blankets besides, so that if he were caught out at night he would have them for a bed. He who addresses you had some pleasant experiences of this kind,-pleasant to contemplate now through a vista of some forty years: He shouldered a barrel of whitefish and trotted off with it, up a steep hill, a distance of four miles. He wishes he could perform the simple feat now. Old Edward, a Hudson Bay employe, who was a young man in the war of 1812, was the most muscular Frenchman I ever met. At the age of ninety he could lift from the ground a barrel of whisky with ease. He could swallow the contents in detail wifl no greater effort. He told me, as we sat by the camp fire, that he subsisted one entire winter in a fur trader's camp, on Lac Vieux desert, on a ration of two small suckers per day. Toward spring he became greatly emaciated and suffered such intolerable pangs of hunger that he was often out of his mind. But for the surreptitious use of a third soocer occasionally he must have died. But to return to my subject. The work of developing our mine was a slow process, at an early day, before the invention of power drills and high explosives. The shaft was sunk in the solid rock with hand drills, one man holding the drill and two striking it with steel hammers. This party worked ten hours and was then relieved by another set of men, the work continuing day and night. Coarse black powder was the only explosive in use. To sink 120 feet in a year was efficient duty. -Now With air-compressor drills and dynamite the same amount of work is done in one month. The progress of the age is scarcely auywhere more strikingly exemplified than in modern mining. Under the old system it took several years to open a mine and test it so as to be assured of its real value. Meantime no costly improvements in building or machinery were attempted by wise managers. Consequently the mining town or hamlet remained in the rough, with no effort at embellishment, and presented about as forbidding an aspect as could well be. To-day matters are managed differently. To illustrate: The Tamarack mine began sinking a great shaft to cut the Calumet lode at a depth of 2,000 feet. The work was experimental, for, although there was little doubt in the mind of Superintendent Daniell that the lode would be cut, there was no certainty that copper would be found in it in paying quantities. However, the great work was vigorously and boldly prosecuted. At' the depth of 2,370 feet the lode was cut, and, fortunately for the enterprising company concerned, it proved rich. Only three and a half years were consumed in this remarkable 23

DEVELOPMENT OF MINING TOWNS.

work. A new town sprang up immediately on the site of the mine, with excellent buildings, etc. But we return again to slower times and methods. As years wore away more room was required. The forests were cleared in ever widening circles. Fuel and timber were needed for general mine use. A readjustment and enlargement of the plant was necessary. Regular streets were laid out, graded and macadamized. Nowhere do you find better streets and roads than in the copper region. The old huts give way to comfortable edifices, and, wonderful to relate, paint on the houses is seen. Garden plats appear, and modest little flower beds cheer the hearts of the good women who have so long had nothing more inviting than blackened stumps to look at. The long days of that high latitude in summer are exceedingly favorable to the growth of flowers and small fruits. The deep snow of winter, seemingly so unpropitious to gardening, is really beneficial. It prevents the ground from freezing and covers all shrubs and plants with an admirably contrived blanket, impervious to the keenest cold. The delicate tea rose, the geranium and violet are confidently left to the care of dame nature, sleeping a long sleep, to awake on the disappearance of the snow, with robust life and unparalleled vigor and beauty. Spring in this northern region comes in with a bound. The growth of all kinds of vegetation is marvelous. A better wagon road to the shipping port is called for by the growing industiries. It is made. Population by natural increase and immigration is rap dly expanding. Nowhere in America are the good wives more prolific thanin the mining regions. With or without reference to a primal injunction of scripture, those people increase and multiply amazingly. Hence the rude log schoolhouse soon gives way to the larger edifice of wood, brick or stone. Schoolmasters multiply. Great attention is given to primary education. Graded schools, with all modern appliances, are found there to-day. And to give the young men that kind of education which they most require, to fit them for their duties as accomplished miners and engineers the state has wisely established a school of mines at Houghton. Churches are also built, whose tall spires take the place of the pine and maple. Stores, shops, hotels, saloons, hospitals, banks, a postoffice, skating rinks, halls, opera houses, in short everything that goes to make a modern city rapidly takes ground. The source of all this activity, wealth and prosperity is, of course, the mine. The city has grown from the mine and is closely wedded to it. The mine gave it birth and supports it. Yet the city is a sort of extrinsic growth -a parasite, if you please. For the mine has a distinct individuality, and has great works of its own to carry on. Underground it has its shafts and

drifts, or galleries, which correspond with the streets and avenues of a city. Hundreds and thousands of feet below the surface of the ground there are railroads, cars, telegraph and telephone lines, and great chambers bright with glittering spars and copper, illuminated by artificial light and filled with miners, trammers and timbermen. The solid rock is pierced with rapidly revolving power drills, moved by compressed air sent down in tubes from reservoirs on the surface. The dynamite cartridge explodes with terrific force, tears asunder the hardest rock held together by tough native copper. Great blocks come crashing down and are seized upon by the trammers, thrown into cars which are pushed to the shafts. Here the rock is dumped into huge skips, or cars, and hoisted by the great engine to the surface, and then dumped into a car of an automatic tram road and moved rapidly away to the distant rock houses where the car discharges its freight and returns to its station without the aid of man. It is hauled by an endless rope wound round a big drum at the engine house. In the rock house it is treated by a large gang of men, called surface men. The underground city is a curious place. To remove the water from the mine great iron pipes descend to the bottom and the great pump, moved by a powerful engine, lifts the water to the surface when it is discharged. To keep the mine open, or in other words, to keep the opposite walls from coming together after the mineral has been removed from the lode, an immense quantity of heavy timber is'used as shoves or stays. A quarter section of pine would speedily find burial in those deep caverns. Indeed a big mine has an awful maw for stolls or saw logs. The consumption of square and round timber and plank is enormous. The hardy fellows who work in the mine are generally contented and healthy. The liability to accidents is ever present, but there are no noxious gases, no terrible explosions, as in coal mines. The air is salubrious, though tainted as a matter of course, with the smoke of " villainous gunpowder." The miners work in gangs or " pairs" as they term it. A "pair " may be two, four or six men, then also called a "party." The work is generally by contract, and goes on night and day. The ten hour system prevails -though often, owing topeculiar circumstances, a gang works only eight hours. The night "shift" dine at midnight in the depths of the mine. They carry down with them a tin pail containing coffee and meats. A Cornishman when he is going to dine says, I must take my "meat." They warm their coffee with the candle on their hats; their "paasty" in the same manner. A " paasty" is an enormous turn-over, filled with chopped beefsteak, boiled potatoes and onions with spice. This strong dish is immensely satisfying. It is the Cornishman's great backer, but no native American should indulge in the toothsome " paasty " at a late hour unless he should desire to

"THE MAN-ENGINE.

have called up in his dreams, ghosts of his forefathers, in unlimited succession. Timbermen are an important class of skilled men in all mines; they perform all the work in wood, building the shaft tramway, ladderway, besides putting in the stolls and staging and the pumps.' At first, access is had to the mine by means of rude ladders, but this is a toilsome road way after the mine becomes deep. A man-engine moved by steam is then substituted. This engine consists of two strong wooden rods or beams, with a small platform, guarded by iron rail, occurring every ten feet on each rod. The rods are close together, resting on rollers, having a parallel, though reverse motion. One rod goes down while the other comes up. At each stroke of ten feet the platforms are just opposite of each other. A man going down into the mine steps on a platform and sinks ten feet.. He then steps onto the opposite platform which has come up and that, reversing its motion, carries him down ten feet more, and so on, until the lowest depths are reached. It is an interesting sight to stand at the mouth of the shaft and look down into the dark abyss. The whistle has blown for dinner; the signal bell sounds the glad tidings throughout the mine. While you are gazing you see far down a point of light. It grows larger presently so that you can see that it is a candle stuck with clay on a miner's hat. Another and another twinkling star rises. You see a long line of them swaying from right to left. The first man now steps out on the platform at your side-a burly Cornishman-clothed in white duck coat and trousers, hobnailed boots and a hard miner's hat. He blows out his candle and walks off, followed by a hundred or more of his companions. We follow the crowd to the "change house." This is a great stone building well heated, provided with hot and cold water baths. Here the men change their garments after copious bathing. Some of these people live with their families, in cottages, others in great boarding houses. You will see on every mine'whole streets devoted to miners. The cottages are comfortable, often having gardens attached. These dwellings belong to the company and are rented to the men. These employ6s are generally well paid and provided for. It is for the best interests of the corporations to keep their men contented so as to insure faithful service and permanency. It is true all corporations are not so wise, but it is a fact, which speaks well for the general management of the mines of the upper peninsula, that labor troubles, strikes, etc., are less frequent there than elsewhere. The mining companies provide hospitals, medicines and doctors, and the people are taxed a small sum for them. The miners have aid societies and guilds of their own.

MINING MACHINERY.

181

We are now on the surface, leaving the Cyclopean mines to their special sphere. Here we can view the immense hoisting, pumping and other engines which do the hardest work. The machinery of its class, is as fine and powerful as any in the world. When the mine was new a windlass, rope and barrel bucket, running on rude skids, with man power, were the instruments used. Later came in the thirty horse power engine, the iron kibble with rope or chains, for the hoisting of mineral. But as the mine developed more efficient machinery was required and substituted, until now there are hoisting engines of many hundred horse power with steel rope and immense skips or cars, running up and down the shafts at high speed, upon T rail, laid in beautifully timbered shafts. The great winding friction drum, thirty feet in diameter, for the rope, revolves with great steadiness and precision, handled by one man, as if it were a toy. There is attached an indicator which tells where the car is at any moment in the shaft; there are also bell and electric signals,, communicating with the deepest portions of the mine. The great pumping engine is a marvel of ingenuity and power. The automatic railroad on trestles high up in the air, transporting mineral from the several shafts to the receiving, or rock house, is a wonderful mechanism. It seems at a distance to be operated by a mysterious power, for no men are seen to manage it. But the cars are drawn by an endless rope which passes round a drum placed in a remote engine house. The rock house is an interesting place to visit. It is a very large building to which all of the rock containing mineral is brought for treatment. Hundreds of busy men are seen there. The crash of the rock as it tumbles down upon iron screens from the elevated railroad, the blows of the heavy sledge hammers, the flying splinters, the ponderous thud of the steam hammer, the crunching of the iron jawed rock breakers, the rapid movement of scores of wheelbarrows, all constitute an animated scone, but ordinary conversation is drowned and the ears almost deafened by the din and clangor. The broken rock disappears under the floor and is caught in shutes. At the mouth of these shutes a train of cars is speedily loaded, and, drawn by a powerdul locomotive, it darts away through the forest, down steep grade to deliver its freight at the distant stamp mill, situated on lake or stream. Here the rock containing copper already so roughly handled, is subjected to a final and more radical treatment. After running under great steam stamps where it is finely pulverized, it flows out on the separators. Here the copper, by repeated washings, is separated from the hand and saved, while the sand and slime are discharged into the lake as waste matter. There are many ingenious devices about this great stamp mill which I cannot stop to describe. I will content myself by stating that the capacity of these modern mills is

THE MINING COMMUNITY.

almost incredible, to wit: 800 to 1,000 tons of hard rock each twenty four hours. As an outgrowth of the mill we find large docks and warehouses, a. fleet of tug boats and scows, coal docks, smelting works and a large and prosperous village. A great mine is a vast industry, a source of incalculable wealth, with a life extending through many years. It benefits not only its immediate people, but the whole mineral region and state at large. Its annual or quarterly dividends to stockholders, however remote, are always appreciated. From $10,000 to $100,000 are distributed monthly by each mine--'a fertilizing stream that reaches far out, in many directions. The mine is managed by a large corps of officers, namely, first the "agent,"' the mine captains, the surface captains, civil and mining engineers, 'chemist, mechanical engineers, machinists, timbermen, carpenters, chief and subordinate clerks, doctors and surgeons, superintendent of stamps and bosses, aJ infiMitum. The people of the mine are made up of many nationalities. The most numerous are the Amei'ican, Scotch, Irish, German, Cornish, Oanadian French, Scandinavian, with a sprinkling of Italian, Belgian, half breed and Indian. There is, as a matter of course, in this conglomeration a diversity of languages, habits and customs. But while retaining many of their national characteristics, as a mass, the community have fused harmoniously. The fatuous "conglomerate," made up.from a variety of minerals, the wreck of older formations, is connected and tied together by the shining native copper. So with our mining community. Its various constituents drifting mainly from the old kingdoms of Europe are drawn hither by an affinity of interest, the tie that binds them is copper. A large majority of these foreign born people become citizens and will remain so, while 6heir numerous offspring, knowing no other allegiance,' will doubtless, in time, become Americans in all respects, true sons and daughters of the great republic. Many of us native Americans do not have to travel a great way back in our lineage to "tree" a Scotch, Irish or English grandfather. The great American nation is, in fact, to use a geological phrase, the biggest "conglomerate" out. The American as found in the mines differs little from the same species found elsewhere. He is intelligent, capable, pushing and enterprising. He does not take to practical mining; it is not his vocation. He prefers to work on the surface in the sunshine. He likes authority, likes to be boss. He is found in many responsible positions. He is a civil or mining engineer and explorer, a machinist, a supply clerk, a chief clerk, an architect and draughts

man, a captain, banker and school master. He has the. usual penchant for politics and will accept office-when elected. The Cornishman, or "cousin Jack," is a native of the duchy of Cornwall, England. I suppose that a residence of a thousand years or more in the insular kingdom entitles him to the protection of the queen, but he has (unadulterated) no Anglo-Saxon blood in his veins. He is supposed to be of Phcenecian or Carthaginian origin. His enterprising ancestors came to Cornwall in quest of tin, and, some of them, finding the climate pleasant and tin plenty, gained a foothold on the rocky peninsula and staid there. The Cornishman of the present day, like his father, is of a roving disposition. His footsteps may be traced around the globe. There is no prominent mining field in the world wherein you will not find " Cousin Jack." He is in Alaska, California, the Rocky Mountains, Mexico, Central and South America, in Australia, India and Lake Superior. He is a first rate miner and possesses a certain sturdiness of frame and disposition that commends him to the observer. He works hard, eats well and fights bravely. He is, numerically, very strong in our northern mines, and, being, as a rule, steady, conservative and skillful, he finds ready employment. He likes mining; esteems his vocation among the most honorable, if not aristocratic. He despises the duties of an ordinary day laborer. In short, he is a born miner and nothing else. As an individual he has many amusing peculiarities; he is fond of his beer, likes to wrestle and is not averse to a hand to hand fight. But he is not quarrelsome. But "Cousin Jack's " language,attracts most attention. His dialect, pure and simple, is unique. He uses many English words with a strange twist, while other words of his you would look for in vain in Webster's unabridged. His idiomatic expressions are curious. I give an example or two. A fond mother shows me her fat, moon faced baby girl. I say, admiringly, what a plump face your child has. She says: "'Oh, 'ees face is the best limb 'ee 'ave." ".Your fayther is coming, tell she to 'eave 'ee on," meaning the dinner. Mary Anne cries out-Children go in, your mother is calling you. The children answer, "Oh us don't belong to she." I give one quotation from a long Cornish poem entitled / MARY ANNE IN THE GROCERY LINE. Iss Betsy-i can selly, here, Good tay fur dree an sex, my dear, And shugar cheaper too; Al pented green, an in a row, Twelve kenisters i got to show, But hafe ar himpty, you

Many of the captains and agents are Cornishmen. The Scotch, as is well known, are canny bodies, and succeed in the mines as elsewhere, in pushing themselves to the front. They make good miners, but most of them, like the Yankee, prefer to work above ground. The Irish are numerous-many of them are miners, but they are versatile and disposed to turn their hand to any kind of surface work also, such as handling cars, making railroads, and feeding stamps. They become good business men and are natural politicians, are always busy at the polls and never refuse a candidacy even for the highest office in the gift of the people. In the schools their children are very bright and numerous. The Canadian Frenchman could not be induced to become a miner. The depths of a mine are a horror to his lively fancy and timid disposition.' His forte is in the woods and his tool, par excellence, is an ax. In cutting cord wood, hewing timber, hauling saw logs, rafting and boating, etc., he is au fast. He avoids the great mine community and loves to dwell near the water, or in the woods, having for his companions his own people. He is clannish in this respect. He is active, patient, good natured, likes to talk, likes the violin and the dance. He spends his money freely, but is not without native shrewdness, is a good deal of a politician, and generally manages to become the owner of a small farm with a comfortable home. He is a good citizen.

CHARACTER OF THE MINING CLASSES.

185

The Scandinavians, who include Norwegians, Swedes, Finns and Danes, are the latest comers to the lake, but they have become a marked addition to the population. A few of them take to mining but the majority of them are common laborers engaging in anything that promises remuneration. Quite a number are fishermen, pursuing their calling profitably in the waters of the great lake, in boats built after the manner of the old Vikings. They are a hardy race and find the climate and country much like that of their old homes beyond the sea. They are better educated than many of the other classes, but have not so much capacity for general work. At first their advent was not hailed with satisfaction. The old settlers looked down upon them with the same sort of aversion as the west coast people do on the heathen Chinee. But they are not heathen, but good Lutheran christians and are rapidly working their way into favor and influence. Among them are found gentlemen of superior education and intelligence. The German makes a capable miner but he does not stick to the business long after coming to this country. He prefers to keep store, run a hotel or saloon, and manage a brewery. He is convivial but looks out for the main chance, accumulates property and becomes an alderman. The mining classes in my judgment are very quiet and law abiding, considering their occupation and surroundings. There is a good deal of the freedom of the frontier, and, although a world of beer is drank, the amount of drunkeness and crime is much less than one would expect to find. There have been occasional strikes but they have been exceptional. There has never been that marked "unrest" among the laboring classes of the Lake Superior country that is so common elsewhere as to be almost chronic. They have chosen to follow the even tenor of their way unprovoked by demagogues whose sympathy for the busy toilers is only another name for personal aggrandizement. There is one peculiarity in towns and cities of the mining regions that strikes an observer from the land of steady habits unfavorably, namely, the festive character of Sunday. The saloons are all wide open on that sacred day and well patronized. Pleasure excursions by rail or on the water are in order. Bands of music and parades of firemen and guilds enliven the morning hour as the pious are wending their way to church. The sound of church bells is drowned in the blare of the trombone. Nor is this all. The saloons are kept open on all holidays and on election days. As a mitigation it is averred that public opinion sanctions these open violations of law and that juries will not convict offenders. If this be so then public opinion-that social tyrant-needs reforming. And it is pleasant to be able to say that more than one city in the mines has had strength enough to close the saloons 24

on Sunday. But all puritanical traditions are at a discount among a people who are frontiersmen and cosmopolitans. Upon the whole our miner is a good citizen, and has worked wonders in that northern wilderness-the upper peninsula. SKETOC OF TEE LIFE OF HON. RIX ROBINSON; A PIONEER OF WESTERN MICHIGAN. BY GEORGE H. WHITE, OF GRAND RAPIDS At the time that Rix Robinson settled upon the Grand River of the terri" tory of Michigan, sixty four years ago, there Was not a neighbor towards the west (except, possibly, one Indian trader) nearer than the Mississippi river; ( nor to the north within two hundred miles; nor to the eastward within, one hundred andtwenty miles; nor to the south (except at his own Kalamazoo station) within one hundred miles. If there was no other reason for it than this, it would be very proper that some attention should be given to the preservation of his memory, but when we add that it was largely through his influence and efforts that the Indians of western Michigan entered into the treaty by which they sold their lands north of Grand River, in this state, to the government, for a fair compensation; and that they and the white settlers lived together so peaceably that our early history presents none of the bloody scenes that disfigure the early history of Ohio, Kentucky and Indiana; and the further facts of his participation in the early administration of affairs in the government of this state, and his prominence in the ranks of the then dominant party, placing within his reach the highest office in the gift of the people of this state, had he desired it, urgently call for a sketch of him, while yet the material for it is within our reach, for within a short time it will be lost forever.' So I have deemed it proper to lay before you to-day what I have learned of it mostly from his associates, friends and relatives who survive him, and from a personal acquaintance with him of nearly twenty years. Rix Robinson was the second son of Edward Robinson, born in Preston, Conn., and Eunice Robinson, born at the same place. His birthplace was at.

EARLY PURSUITS.

187

Richmond, Berkshire county, Mass., where his father, for many years, carried on his trade of blacksmithing, and the cultivating of a very few acres of land. Rix was born on the 28th day of August, 1789, but at about the beginning of this century his father removed, with his family, to the fertile Genesee country, (then so famous) into that part of the town of Scipio that is now the town of Venice, in Cayuga county, N. Y. He was the third of thirteen children, the oldest a girl, being the only child of the first wife, the others being the children of the second wife. He had eight brothers, all of whom attained a stalwart manhood. He had, and fully availed himself of, the advantages of an excellent common school and academical training at a somewhat locally famous academy in Cayuga county. At the age of about nineteen years he commenced the study of law (which with the approval of his parents he had chosen as his future avocation), at Auburn, N. Y., in a law office of excellent repute, which he continued three years, and' then was admitted to practice law in 1811, if my memory serves me rightly, or possibly in 1812. Soon after this, and before he had entered upon his practice, the war of 1812 was commenced. His father was a very bitter opponent of it, of the Connecticut and Massachusetts school, as unnecessary and suicidal, as was the very general opinion of New Englanders of that day, and about which parties were then pretty evenly divided. Samuel Phelps, a neighbor living half a mile away, had received the appointment of a sutler to some of the troops them massed on the Canadian frontier, and not having enough capital, and needing a bright, energetic, and active assistant, proposed to Robinson to go into partnership with him and furnish $1,000, a very large sum of money in those days. His father approved of it as a business venture, and furnished him the money, having to borrow a portion of it, his brother Lewis working out by the month afterwards to pay the borrowed portion. Mr. Phelps stayed principally with the troops, and Rix made the purchases and saw to their tÃ½nsportation to the places where used. While thus engaged, drafting took place, he as well as his elder brother Edward, being the holder of a prize number, to fill up the New York militia regiments. His father's opposition to the war was so strong that he was determined that neither of his sons should go, and commanded them to keep out of the way of the officers sent to pick up the drafted persons, a not very hard job at that time. Rix was up stairs at the residence of his sister, Mrs. Eunice Church, a few miles away from his father's house, engaged in writing in a back room when the officers came to take him. They were informed that he had been there. After waiting awhile and he not appearing, they went away without him, and no further A

effort to get him was made before the close of the war. This was the only cause of his remaining in the west so long, for he had incurred a heavy pecuniary penalty in common with others, and many prosecutions were commenced in that region to recover, and his was one of the cases which they announced they would prosecute, and went so far as to issue process which, because of his continued absence, they were unable to serve. He and his partner continued this sutler business after the close of the war. Without receiving its pay their regiment was ordered to Detroit. Nearly all of its members were largely indebted to them and they followed so as to be present at paying off time, and receive their dues. They were twenty six days in getting their stock of supplies and themselves from Buffalo there. Pay day did not arrive. The regiment was ordered to Mackinac. They followed on the brig Hunter, arriving there in November, 1815. They received the appointment of post sutlers, and remained until the troops were ordered to Green Bay, where they remained during the winter of 1816 and 1817, after which the troops were dispersed in detachments without receiving their back pay. A part of them were ordered to Dubuque and a part to Mackinac; the partners separated, keeping with the largest detachments. Their time. expired and without being paid and formally mustered out they, as it were, disbanded and returned to their homes, leaving the sutlers minus their goods and their pay, and with only their promises, which were in but few instances kept. Messrs. Phelps and Robinson found that all their profits for several years of labor, and a considerable portion of their capital were outstanding. Mr. Robinson was much chagrined over this condition of things, and was aware that process was out against him at home for the penalty of non-appearance to do military duty, a judgment on which would absorb the balance of his means, and leave him indebted besides; with that firmness and determination that was a marked trait with him, he concluded to go into the Indian trading business, if possible, and so suggested to Mr. Phelps, who readily acceded to the idea. Both of them had fully investigated it at Mackinac and Green Bay through curiosity, and become well acquainted with the good and bad qualities of furs and their values and the best modes and places of marketing them. They selected each a place to trade at with the Indians, in, I think, Wisconsin, invested their cash and their goods in goods fitted for the Indian market and incurred some considerable indebtedness. In the spring they rendevouzed together at Mackinac, disposed of their furs etc., and paid their debts, and found that Mr. Robinson had made quite handsomely, considering the difficulties that surrounded him, and that Mr. Phelps had lost about an equal amount. This unlooked for result surprised them, and resulted in a dissolution, Mr. Phelps returning eastward. Mr. Robinson

took a portion of the money and some notes which proved to be worthless except one against Mr. Douseman, but he found his capital insufficient to fully enable him to carry on the business without incurring a very large indebtedness, which he was loath to do. John Jacob Astor had become acquainted with Mr. Robinson before this at Mackinac, and had observed him and his personal appearance, and his ways, and had been favorably impressed. At this time Mr. Astor was really the American Fur Company, which was merely a N. Y. corporation, consisting of himself and certain named associates, but who had not put a cent into the concern, he furnishing its whole capital. At this time he was engaged in having a large number of clerks brought in, principally from Montreal, and distributing them around to the different stations. Those who showed no aptitude for the trade he would weed out and retain the others, apprentices as it were, in the trade. As subsequent events show it was a part also of his plan then to cover the whole country east of the Rocky Mountains, next to the northern boundary, which then was one of the principal sources of supply of the Hudson's Bay Company, with stations, and then secure as far as he readily could, the services of the independent traders, -as employes, and compel the others to seek his employ by putting, in each instance, one of his best men in the neighborhood of such trader, giving him unlimited supplies, with directions to overbid such with the Indians, each time, and compel him thereby to either leave because of lack of business or seek his employ; but at this time, 1818, he had not got so far as to develop this last portion of his plan. At this time there was a point several hundred miles away, and very near to the St. Peter's river and to the Hudson Bay Company's post, that it was essential to his plans to have occupied. Thus far, each one who had been sent there had been intimidated and driven off, without in any manner getting up any trade with the Indians there. At this time his two real resident partners at the west were Ramsey Crooks, who was in New York city most of the tme as purchasing agent of the Mackinac depot of the company, and Robert Stuart, who managed the affairs at the west from Mackinac. It occurred to Mr. Astor that Robinson, who was then a large, powerful young man of about 30 years of age, over six feet tall, of splendid physical presence, apparently a courageous person, somewhat acquainted with the Indian language and habits, and a little acquainted with Indian trading and much so with men, a well informed young man, might succeed in holding the post, and resist their attempts at driving away by intimidation. Acting on this he made an offer to Mr. Robinson to go and stay through the season of 1818 and 1819, for a given sum, and as his own capital was insufficient, Mr. Robinson gladly accepted it.

190 A LONELY TRADING POST. He was fitted out and the stock and himself transported to the given point, by the employes of the company, and then he was left to remain there without any companion until the employ6s should come, in. the following June, to take him and the results of his winter's trading to the grand rendezvous of the American fur company, at Mackinac. The same course was pursued towards him that had been towards his predecessors. His post was indeed a dreary one; no Indians visited it, although passing often in sight of it on their way to Hudson Bay company posts. As the winter advanced their hostility towards him increased. It was evident to his mind that he and they would ere long be in collision, and he could hope for no aid from the equally hostile posts of the Hudson Bay company. t was becoming very monotonous to him; his only occupations were to hunt, for he was a remarkably fine marksman, and successful hunter, and passionately fond of the sport until but a short time before his death; to study the Indians as they passed by, noticing the least act and inferring its cause; and to read in his favorite Shakespeare and the very few other books he had. Towards the close of winter he received unexpectedly a white guest; my recollection is that he stated that he was an army officer, who came on some mission among the Indians and there heard of and visited him. He was indeed gladly welcomed, for his presence broke the monotony that was becoming almost insupportable. At this time, to all appearance, the mission of Mr. Robinson was a failure and would be fruitless. He had made every possible endeavor to secure the trade or even the presence of the Indians in his log house, that his knowledge of Indian character suggested to him as having any possible effect on the boycott that he was suffering. The old chief of the tribe was particularly active in demonstrations, such as branilishing his tomahawk, etc., and took it upon himself to frequently pass very near to the door of the post, on his way to the other traders, indulging in insults and threats, also shaking a package of furs at him, as much as to say, "Don't you wish I would sell these to you.? I am going to take them to the Hudson Bay company's trader and sell them.' Mr. Robinson didn't seem to notice it, but waited silently what he saw must ere long come, a collision with them, such as his predecessors had encountered. He had made up his mind that there was some way of outwitting the Hudson Bay company's people with these Indians, for he plainly saw that they were at the bottom of it. He resolved to study up the Indian character as thoroughly as he could, so as to solve the problem. One of the first things that he had noticed was, that the bundle, which seemed to be of superb fur, was so arranged as to seem to display ostentatiously that fact, and each time seemed to be of the same size; it seemed to him also that each time the furs

were too fine to be often got, and he soon concluded that it was the same package every time; that it was not a mere accidental ebullition of temper, but solely to insult and annoy him, and drive him away; he inferred that if they failed in that they would make more aggressive efforts to rid themselves of him. He had also concluded that the climax was about at hand; that he should meet it boldly and aggressively; personal fear did not trouble him at all. Mr. Robinson told. the writer, and so he did Mr. John F. Godfroy, that his study of the Indian character had resulted in two rules to govern his intercourse with them, which he had pursued undeviatingly. The first was to never show any fear of an Indian, however many might be his followers or comrades. The other was never to take an insult from an Indian without chastisement, but not to administer chastisement until he had proceeded so far as to be beyond retreat or retraction, for then, the administration of proper chastisemert would not cause a feeling or desire of revenge, or provoke the interference of his friends. Before the departure of his guest, the chief accompanied by a number of his tribe, entered the log shanty whose threshold they had not before crossed. Mr. Robinson had, as all Indian traders in those days had, some fire-water for sale, but this was kept in a strong log addition, whose hewn plank door {fastened together with wooden pins without any iron whatever) was closed and fastened. The chief seated himself upon a heavy three-legged stool, and the following colloquy occurred: "Got any whiskey?" "Yes." "I want some." Trader (looking around as if,to see his furs), "Where are your furs, your peltries?" "Haven't any." "Well, I keep whiskey to sell, not to give away." "I help myself when they are not willing to give it freely." Upon saying this the chief jumped. up, seized the stool and threw it against the door with such force as to break it open and started towards it. He had hardly got three steps before Mr. Robinson struck him with his fist under the ear. He fell senseless into the fireplace where three logs were burning, Robinson putting his foot on the chief's head. His guest caught his arm saying "Hold! Robinqonl Hold! he has got enough." Robinson then dragged the body to t6e door, telling his followers to take him away or he would kill him; they took him away. His guest, fearing their revenge, advised him not to go any more into the woods hunting. During the winter Robinson had hunted a good deal, thereby adding to his larder, and the furs, skins and peltries of the company. He thought it over and concluded that the true course for him was to go with his rifle into the woods, where he could see an Indian as quickly as an Indian could see him, and to shoot him down if he showed the least sign of an attempt at revenge. He said that had he seen the Indian in the woods he would probably have shot him down

ROBINSON AN INDEPENDENT TRADER.

at sight. The next three days he went with his rifle into the woods to hunt, expecting not game but an Indian, and then gave it up. Some four:or five days after that he was sitting near the fire with his rifle over his knees, priming it, when hearing a slight noise he looked up and saw this chief peeping from one side into the door towards him. Robinson arose, walked to the door, the chief not retreating, and said: "You here?" "Yes." "Come down to fight?" "No." "Want to fight?" "No." Chief: "You want to fight?" "Yes, if you come to fight; don't you want to fight?" "No, made fool of myself other day, want to make all up with you." "Well, you have concluded to make it up, have you?" "Yes." "Well, here is a pipe of tobacco." They sat dowh together, smoked it and talked the matter over. From that time the chief and his tribe were his fast friends, and the Hudson Bay company got no more furs from that quarter. The chief himself brought him more fur than any other three Indians, as he was a great hunter and trapper. If any of the tribe came around a little full and was boisterous a look from him to the chief resulted in such Indian being seized by the chief and carried outside. This illustrates not only his general knowledge of human nature but his special knowledge of the Indian character. The business of the post resulted so well that when his furs, skins and peltres were carried in to Mackinac, they were received with great surprise. Mr. Astor was not there. Mr. Stuart sought to keep him in their employ, but Mr. Robinson had resolved to be his own master. His white guest had some acquaintance with the tobacco trade among the Indians as carried on at that time from St. Louis, and had told him whatever he knew, enveloped in such roseate hues as to fill Mr. Robinson with a desire to enter into that trade as the most lucrative that he could well enter, Mr. Robinson drew all of his funds out, went to St. Louis and bought a quantity of tobacco and some supplies and went into business again as an independent Indian trader, and pursued it among them during the season of 1819. The profit he made selling tobacco to the Indians.increased his capital to a point sufficient to enable him to again start in business on his own account as an Indian trader. In looking around for a location, he concluded that a post on the Calumet river, in what is now South Chicago, would be among the most desirable and advantageous, so he commenced there in the autumn. His winter's business was so good that he found himself able to establish another station down on the Illinois river, about twenty five miles from its mouth, in 1820, and also one in Wisconsin, at or near where Milwaukee now stands. In the years 1819 and 1820 St. Louis was the point at which he disposed of his furs, etc., and purchased his goods and supplies. The journey to and.*.,' - . i.-.

from that place in his canoes and barges was long, slow and tedious, and had many portages, and was very monotonous. But in 1821 his position changed; he was no longer a mere Indian trader, but became a limited partner in the American Far Company, Ramsey Crooks and Robert Stuart being, so far as I can learn, the only full partners of Mr. Astor therein. Mr. Astor was at Mackinac, and from there sent to Mr. Robinson a request to.* eet him at Mackinac, and then offered him the chance to go to the Grand, Kalamazoo, and Muskegon rivers, making his headquarters on the Grand. At this time the British government was paying to the Indians of Michigan an annuity (if it may be so termed) and making presents, at a certain time, at Maiden, in Canada, thereby keeping their good will, and, to some extent, securing their furs, etc. The American Fur Company had for some years a small station near the mouth of the So-wan-gue.sake (meaning forked stream, that is the Thornapple) river, where it empties into the O-wash-te-nong (Grand) river. The literal meaning of the name is, "far in the interior;" that is literally, "far Sff land river." The post was near where Ada is, and, for some time after her husband's death, had been managed quite ably'by Madame La Framboise, a French half-breed, in the interest of the American Far Co., but she had concluded to retire from the business. Mr. Robinson accepted the offer and at once closed up his post near the mouth of the Illinois river, and came over to the mouth of the Grand river, now Grand Haven, and established a post, although prior to that he had taken possession of the one at Ada. He selected a lovely site on the bank of the river at a point from which he could readily penetrate into the remote interior parts of the lower peninsula by means of the Grand river and its numerous long tributaries, navigable for the canoe and the Mackinac boats, as his permanent home. For he had now become so completely weaned from civilized life as to have no desire to return to it. He also selected and married according to the Indian customs, Pee-miss-a-quot-o-quay (flying cloud woman), the daughter of the principal chief of the Pere Marquette Indians, in September, 1821. By her he had one child, now the Rev. John Robinson, an exemplary Methodist missionary among the Ottawa and Chippewa Indians of the state. She died; he married again (the white man's way) another Indian woman who had been educated in the mission school at'Mackinac. Her name was Se-be-quay (river woman); the ceremony was performed by Rev. Leonard Slater, the Baptist missionary at Thomas Station. She was a sister of Nabun-na-ge-zhick (c'half day" or " part of the day ") and granddaughter of 25

MANAGEMENT OF INDIANS.

Na-nom-ma-daw-ba, the head chief of the Grand river Indians at the mouth. By her he had no children. He established other posts at Flat river, at Muskegon and up the Kalamazoo a few miles from its mouth. His firmness and decision, his absolute fairness of dealing, his knowled'ge of their character, and his remarkable knowledge of their language, his acquaintance with their traditions, customs and unwritten laws, his truthfulness, and his taking to himself an Indian wife, resulted in giving him a very great influence among that people. Many stories illustrative of these traits are told of him. I will select and relate two or three. Nim-min-did, a large, powerful, finely built Indian bully well known on the lower Grand river from its mouth to Flat river, who thoroughly hated a white man, in 1823, conspired with some other Indians, having a like hatred, to thresh Mr. Robinson and drive him from the river, through fear. His conduct on two or three occasions when he came to the Ada trading post was such as to satisfy lMr. Robinson that he meant to give him trouble, when a good opportunity arose, so he was particularly guarded in his intercourse with that Indian. On the return of the Indians from one of their great hunts Mr. Robinson was much gratified by their encamping near his post,juntil he discovered that Nim-min-did was with them and they had a bottle or two of whiskey. He surmised that now his time of trial had come. He went into his storeroom, cleared an open space, and placed an armful of finely cut rather long maple sticks on the fire. In a little time a lot of squaws and young and old Indians crowded into the room, followed by Nim-min-did, who began jostling the other Indians. Robinson stepped forward to Nim-min-did and ordered him to leave; hardly were the words of refusal out of his mouth before Mr. Robinson caught and threw him into the fire, taking him completely by surprise. The squaws shrieked, the old men ejaculated, "Ugh! ugh I" and the young Indians laughed at the discomfited bully, to whom but a moment before they were ready to bow down. Nim-min-did rolled off the fire, howling with pain, and ran to the woods a few rods away. In those few minutes he had lost his standing and become an outcast. Nothing was seen or heard of him for a number.of years, when on one occasion, as Mr. Robinson was in his canoe, being paddled along near Battle Point, on the lower Grand river, a tall Indian stood on the Point and beckoned to them to come ashore. On lauding, the Indian rushed up to Mr. Robinson with apparent gladness and friendliness-it was Nim-min-did. After a few minutes talk with him, in which he stated that he had gone away a good many days' journey, and had been a good Indian ever since, they separated, and none of them ever saw or heard of him after that.

CLOSE OF INDIAN TRADING.

A year or two after that his agent, at Grand Haven, told him that one of the Indians there, who was large and reputed to be quite string and ugly, was in the habit of coming into the store room, and without leave to do so, or paying for it, helping himself to whiskey. The next time Mr. Robinson was there he inquired into it. Bat a day or two elapsed before the Indian came in and, as usual, proceeded to help himself to the whiskey. Mr. Robinson said, " What do you want? " Reply, " Whiskey." " Well, if you pay for it you *can have it." " I will have it, pay or no pay," and the Indian started towards the barrel. Mr. Robinson planted a heavy blow between his eyes, knocking him down and then kicking him out. Several days after a young friendly Indian came to him and told him to look out, for this Indian was bad and had just carefully hid a knife in his breech cloth and was coming to talk with him. Sqon the Indian came in and wanted him to go out with him and talk it over. The Indian started to go out behind him. Robinson said, "Go ahead." When they got off one side, Robinson said, "When we talk this over you may get mad, have you got a. knife about you?" " Oh no," he replied, "he had no knife, he would not get mad." Robinson said, " I must search you." The Indian had so adroitly secreted the knife that Robinson did not discover it, but the young Indian stepped up and pulled it out from his breech cloth behind. The Indian appeared dumbfounded at being detected. Robinson said, "You have brought me out here into the bushes by the river to murder and throw me into the river, have you? " "No, no! " Robinson was enraged, jumped on to him, threw him into the river and held his head under water; he became insensible, the bubbles gurgled up through the water, he was drowning him. Some squaws seeing them go towards the bushes of the river bank, had surmised the truth and hurried forward, as was their usual way to prevent, if possible, any collision. Just then they got there and begged so hard of Robinson not to kill him, as he might do, under Indian law, that he passed the seemingly lifeless body to them and walked away. They resuscitated him. Robinson did not see him for more than a year, then he came to him and asked his pardon. After a time he entered his employ and was one of his best and most trusted men for many years. When Michigan became a state in 1836, Mr. Robinson and all other Indian traders foresaw that the business of Indian trading must soon close, and he resolved to turn his attention to farming and his mercantile and land matters at Grand Haven, and go out of the business except what little might come to Ada station. He had now become very wealthy, and was looked up to and highly respected by the few white settlers that had come in within the few preceding years. In 1834 Mlr. Astor had sold out the business and property of the American Fur Company to Ramsay Crooks and a party of eastern men.

196 DEVELOPMENT OF WESTERN MICHIGAN. This required the final settling up of the business at all posts and with all special partners, so in 1835, 1836 and 1837, Mr. Robinson settled up the affairs of the different posts in his charge and his accounts with the company, closing out the Kalamazoo post in 1837, the Grand Haven and Ada posts in 1836, and the other minor posts in 1835, to the satisfaction of both the company and himself. In 1831 the legislative council by an act approved March 2, had set off sixteen of the present twenty four government townships of Kent county, and established them as a county by the name of Kent. In 1834 the council organized the whole county as a township to bear the name of Kent, to take effect on the first Monday of April, 1834; they had already attached this and other territory to Kalamazoo for judicial purposes, etc., October 1, 1830, and at the first election, held the first Monday of April, 1834, Mr, Robinson was elected supervisor of the township of Kent, which had then an area of 576 square miles, and as such attended the sessions of the board of supervisors of Kalamazoo county in the years 1834 and 1835. The land where the city of Grand Haven now is, was surveyed by the government in 1832, and was opened up to preemption claims. It was here that Mr. Robinson had had his post for eleven years, and he preempted the tract on which it was situated, for he had faith that a city would grow up there when the country was settled. Mr. Robert Stuart had the same faith and purchased a half interest in it, and then sent the Rev. Wm. M. Ferry, the father of Ex. U. S. Senator T. W. Ferry, with means to go there as his agent. The Grand Haven company was organized, composed of Mr. Iobinson, owning one half, and Mr. Stuart, with Mr. Ferry and Ferry's brotherin-law, Capt. N. EI. White, owning the other half interest in the land, who platted the land and named it Grand Haven. Mr. Robinson had become the head of the firm (located at Grand Haven in 1835) of Robinson, White & Williams, as he was painfully reminded when he had to pay upwards of $30,000 of its indebtedness out of his own pocket. Thus we see Mr. Robinson at the time of the foundation of this state, an ex-Indian trader, engaged in making a large, beautiful farm of several hundred acres, a large landholder, the part proprietor of a village; the head of a large mercantile establishment, and the official head of a new township.whose destiny to become a rich, thriving, populous country was even then to be foreseen. Mr. Robinson had as early as 1835 entered with all of his energy into the matter of turning emigration to western Michigan, and had procured the emigration of six of his brothers, with their families, in all forty two persons, from Cayuga county, N. Y., in 1835, coming in one vessel from Detroit, the

schooner St. Joseph. They located and became farmers at different points between the mouth of Grand river and Flat river, one of its tributaries. This was the inciting cause of a large emigration from that portion of western New York, during thd next two yeaTs, of some of our most valued inhabitants. Mr. Robinson was largely instrumental in siecuring the making of the treaty of Washington with the Indians in 1836. accompanying them to Washington for that purpose. By that treaty more than half of the area of the lower peninsula was ceded by the Indians to the general government, for a full, fair consideration. By it was reserved special tracts to a number of different persons, including 640 acres to the"'Indian family of Mr. Robinson. The land is now partly covered by the city of Grand Rapids; it was appraised and its value given them, the government keeping the land. According to Mr. Everett, the amount was $23,040 or 83 an acre. In connection with his going to Washington with the Indian chiefs, who <leclinedto go without Mr. Robinson, who went at the solicitation of the government, on its expense, I will note here the following anecdote. He took charge of the transportation of the chiefs who filled two stage coaches full. They stopped at a tavern in the interior of Indiana; he stepped up to the landlord and said, " I want so many good dinners for these Indians." They were seated and just helped when the stages again drove up and the drivers announced themselves as ready to go and would not wait, as they were carrying U. S. mail. Mr. Robinson saw n.o help for it, and counted out the silver at 25 cents a head, the highest price then paid for a meal at a tavern, many charging as low as half that amount. The landlord said, "You must double that sir." " That is not fair, we havenot even had enough to eat, and that is the highest price usually charged-for such." "Fifty cents is my price sir, it is no fault of mine that the stages will not wait, the food was ready." It was paid. On their way back when nearing the same place he would not for a whole day let them eat; the chiefs complained of hunger; his only reply was, " tighten your belts." A' short time before arriving at the tavern, he got up beside first one driver and then the other. 'The chink of silver could have been heard. They arrived there. He ordered as before,' adding that his Indians were very hungry. He didn't seem to recognize the landlord (or the place. The landlord smiled, as much as to say, I will make another good haul. The food was set before them. Robinson said, " Loosen your belts." It disappeared in a minute; they called for more, the girls brought it, the landlord rushed distracted to the door, but no stages were driving up, nor were there any signs of any; more food was the call; all that was cooked was brought up, then the cold meats and everything eatable were brought and eaten up;

OFFICIAL POSITIONS.

finally their appetites were satisfied, but the famine in that house was awfuL Mr. Robinson stepped up to the landlord and counted out one half a dollar a head. "That will not pay me one quarter of the cost of the raw material." " I can't help it, sir; you set your own price when we were here before, and that is it; and look here friend, would it not be well to not play tricks on travelers?" "Well, sir, you shan't go until you pay me my charges." " Sir, don't you know that at a word from me, you and every man about here would be killed in ten minutes? It will not look well for you to attack them or attempt to keep them." The coachmen were called and were quickly on hand. The whole secret of the matter was, Mr. Robinson had penetrated the innkeeper's secret and overbid him with the drivers. At the formation of the state he was appointed one of the first board of commissioners of internal improvements, who were to expend the five million loan, which the state had made for the formation of a grand railroad system, a grand canal system, and a grand system of river improvements, and, for several years, gave almost his entire personal attention and services to the performance of its duties. Col. Andrew T. McReynolds, then (1836 to 1848) a resident of Detroit (which was then virtually Michigan) and, at that time, one of the most prominent of her business men, and a large factor in the politics of the state, describes the standing and the personal appearance of Mr. Robinson thus: "I knew Rix Robinson from 1834, long before he went into the senate. He was a man of good judgment, and quiet, pleasant, social ways, and not at all dissipated; his habits were most excellent. His principal associates in Detroit were John Norvall, Lucius Lyon, Tom Sheldon, U. S. Senator Palmer's father, Judge Witherell, Judge Wilkins, and such men of standing always. He was a man of imposing form and stature, dressed neatly, always attracted attention on the streets more than any other man in Detroit, by his size, his general appearance, and a certain massiveness of head and face. People stopped as he he passed along to look at him. He was a very positive, determined man; it was difficult to move hi~ convictions. He was a man of sterling integrity; his word was as good as his bond." A mere enumeration of the offices he held, no one of which was solicited by him, for the office sought him, will give convincing proof of the estimation in which he was held in the early days of the state. He was township assessor of Ada in 1838, and supervisor of Ada in 1841. When the supervisor system was restored in 1844 he was again supervisor of Ada. He was commissioner to build a state road from lonia county seat to Grand Kapids in 1840. In 1836-7 he was appointed and confirmed by the senate one of the commissioners of internal improvements of the state of,O

Michigan. He was state senator from the 5th district in the eleventh legislature, and from the 7th district in the twelfth, thirteenth and fourteenth legislatures. In 1844-5 be was associate justice of the circuit court for the county of Kent; was one of the commissioners for improvement of the rapids in Grand river in 184-, and member of the convention that formed the constitution in 1850, under which we are now living. The nomination to the office of governor of the state, with a certai nty of election, was in his power while the democratic party was in the zenith of its power in this state. He declined to allow his name to be used, solely because of the fact that his wife was an Indian (for whom he had the tenderest affection) and would be unable aud unwilling to perform the social duties that were then required of the governor's wife.' She was by no means an uneducated woman and was an excellent housekeeper, but not fitted to shine in social life. 'She would not even use the English language in ordinary conversation, although well acquainted with it. She was proud of her Indian blood and ancestry, and hardly deemed the generality of white blood up to its level. Mr. Robinson was possessed Of cultivated tastes, read a good deal and kept himself well posted on the topics of the day. He was a quiet man, reserved, but not shy; not given to talking much about himself, and was a very careful, conscientious, truthful man in making statements. His insight into human nature was quite extraordinary. He had great love of his home, his family and his kin, and was always the red men's friend, to whom they went in difficulty for counsel and advice. He had much quiet humor, as was shown by his famous proclamation against the logs; was a good story teller, when with intimate friends; had a very retentive, ready memory, was energetic and sympathetic. He took up the wrongs of the Indians always, and had them fedressed, as in the case of the trial and conviction of Miller for the murder, in 1842, of the squaw, Ne-ga. In the detection and arrest of the fugitive sheriff, Hon. T. D. Gilbert won for himself laurels and evincel considerable skill as a detective, as seemingly he had no starting clue. His kicking Sim Johnson, one of Bachanan's trusted political friends, through the streets of Grand Rapids, for not returning 2,00OOU silver dollars lent him to enable his wildcat bank to make a good show to the bank commissioner who was inspecting its pecuniary condition, was done in mid-day, in the most public part of the city. Johnson was nearly as tall and well formed a man as Mr. Robinson. The ridicule it excited drove Johnson away. Mr. Robinson was always very hospitable and gene-ous, often aided his friends with his name, to such an extent that at the time of his death, although possessing -yet a large property, it was found to not very much

He became president of the Old Settlers' Association of Kent, lonia and Ottawa counties three years before his death and held that position when he died. He was a man of temperate habits. Until a couple of years before his death, he was not in the habit of attending divine se-vice, save on funeral occasions. The complete reformation that the influence of divine truth had produced upon his son, the Rev. John. R. Robinson, in elevating him from a drunken, dissolute half-breed, a source of constant trouble and anxiety to his father, to a sober, grave, considerate, kind son, a good citizen, an humble follower of the cross, an outspoken disciple, a clergyman working with zeal among his race, and one whose private life had become unblemished, after a time caused him to turn his attention to the cause of it, and finally to ask for the rite of baptism himself. The last two or three years of his life he was himself a follower of the cross, and he had the utmost confidence as to his future life beyond this world. His intellect was strong a!id clear; it was only the physical body that was worn out and ceased to be the wrap of the soul January 13, 1875. No monument marks the place where this remarkable man's remains repose, on the crest of a hill at Ada, overlooking the river he so loved, and the home of more than fifty years of his life. JUDGE BAZIL HARRISON. CONTRIBUTED BY A. D. P. VAN BUREN. Judge Bazil Harrison, the pioneer settler of Kalamazoo county, died at the residence of his son, John S. Harrison, on Prairie Ronde, Aug. 30, 1874, at the advanced age of 103 years. The following sketch of the life of the, deceased was prepared at the time of his death, by f Mr. J. H. Stone, the former editor of the Kalamazoo Telegraph Judge Harrison came of not only hardy stock, but patriotic ancestry. His paternal grandfather, William Harrison, was a native of Scotland, and his grandmother, of Welsh birth. These grandparents immigrated to Virginia,

His father's name was also William Harrison, and he was born in Berkeley, Virginia, about 1732. William Harrison, Jr., was twice married, and by his two Wives was the father of 23 children, our centenarian being a son of the second wife, whose name was Worlender Davis. His father married her in Maryland about the same time his younger brother, Benjamin Harrison (father of President Harrison and uncle of the judge), married her mother, Clara Davis,, a widow. These two brothers seem to have been very unlike in tastes and character. Benjamin Harrison, as is well known, was one of the prominent men of the revolution, a man of great intellectual power and brilliant career. He entered public life at 24, as a member of the Virginia house of Burgesses, of which he soon became one of the leaders. He participated in the proceedings of the first congress, and was a signer of the Declaration, and during the first two years of the war served with distinction as chairman of the board of war. He was an intimate friend of Washington, and was three times elected governor of Virginia William Harrison, the father of the subject of our sketch, was not lacking in natural capacity and not behind his younger brother in patriotism. But he seems to have been one of those characters, so frequently found in great families, who are never successful. He was, so far as we are able to learn, of good habits and industrious, but as his grandson (who remembers him well) said to the writer, "he never got ahead. He farmed it all his life, yet never owned a farm!" If, however, he did not render so great services to his country as his illustrious brother, he did not live in vain and was not lacking in patriotic endeavor. Of his twentythree children sixteen attained their majority and Judge Harrison has several times described to us with pride and enthusiasm the departure of six of his older brothers for Washington's army. It must have been in the year 1778, perhaps just after Clinton's defeat at Monmouth had kindled the hopes of patriots, or the inhuman massacre, by Butler's savages, at Wyoming, had aroused their indignation and fears, and the father's address to his sons was worthy of a sire of Rome or Sparta. "Boys," said he to his six stalwart grown soirs, "I cannot go into the army myself,-I am too old, and must remain to care for mother and the younger children. But I will look after the farm and raise the corn while you are gone. We must not let the British get a foothold in this country. We had better all die than do that. Go and fight for your country and follow where Washington leads, and may God bless and keep you." As the old Judge last summer described to us this scene, there was something of youthful fire in his half dimmed eyes, and his voice strengthened as he related this event of nearly a hundred years ago. It evidently made an impression on his youthful mind never to be effaced. "Oh 26

FAMILY RECORD.

yes, I remember well," said he, "we all helped them put on their guns and swords, and I saw them march away together, just at daylight, to fight under Washington." And then he related some of their narrow escapes and spoke of wounds they had received; how "Kinzie had a bullet in his neck" which he would never have extracted, but carried with him to his grave this souvenir of battle. The Judge's father had learned to love and honor Washington, for he had been with him in Braddock's expedition, and often told his children the story of that awful day, and the charmed life that the young Virginian c.)lonel, who was afterwards to be so great in history, seemed to wear. Just when and where the Judge's parents were married we have been unable to definitely fix. They were, we think, however, married in Frederick county, Maryland, in about 1750, for men and women married young in those days. Our centenarian was born in the county named, 30 miles from Baltimore. As to the year of his birth, there is, and has been for quite a number of years, some dispute in the family. The old family record was destroyed about thirty five years ago, and the children do not agree as to the date. The oldest son, William Harrison, who lives in Climax, contends that it was in 1770, and assures us that he knows he is right, for he had made a transcript of the old Bible record only a few weeks before that was destroyed at the burning of his sister's house, 30 years ago, and this copy he exhibited to us. He is just 20 years, lacking two months, younger than his father, and is positive of the accuracy of his statement, which he says his mother corroborated just before her death. Judge Harrison himself says he was born in 1771, and that is the year all his children, except the oldest, agree upon. We have made considerable effort to gather evidence on this point, and in the course of our search have talked with the Judge's neighbors and fellow pioneers. Several of these latter claim that the Judge stated to them while the old record was in existence that he was born in 1772. Many of our readers at first thought may cotnsider it strange that there should be any dispute on a simple question of age, but in the course of our search on this subject not less than ten similar cases have been related to us, and that such disagreements are quite common in old families and among even middle aged people, anyone by a little attention to the subject will discover. It is only fair, when there is such disagreement, to be governed by the preponderance of family testimony, and that fixes the date of the Judge's birth as March 15, 1771. The names of his brothers and sisters who grew up were as follows: William, Josiah, Kinzie, Grovier, Samuel, James, Zepheniah, Sarah, Phoebe and Amelia, half brothers and sisters, children of his father by his first wife,



Page 203
EARLY-LIFE.. 203 and Elisha; Diana, Shadrack, Ephraim and Joseph, own brothers and sisters. All of them except the three last named were older than Bazil, who was the third child by the second wife. None of these brothers and sisters are now living, nor are we able to give accurately the dates when they died. The father lived to a good old age, and died in western Pennsylvania about 1812. The family lived near Fredericksburg until our hero was about nine years old, when his father thought to better his condition by removing to Virginia, and the family accordingly crossed the Potomac and settled on a farm near Winchester, in that part of Frederick Co. which is now known as Hampshire Co. They did not long remain there, but after five years' residence, crossed into Pennsylvania, settling near Greencastle, Franklin Co., five or six miles from the Maryland line. The older children had by this time become somewhat scattered, several being married and engaged in farming in Virginia and Maryland. The family consisted of the father and mother and the younger children. Bazil was L4 years old. He helped his father on the rented farm for a short time, and then went to work in a distillery, a business which he followed as long as he lived in Pennsylvania. There are few incidents of his early life that we are able to obtain. He was a steady, hard working lad, energetic and thorough. He received but little education, three months in the common school forming about all of his educational curriculum. He learned to read and write however, and took quite as much interest in books as those around him. Like most boys he early fell in love, the object of his adoring passion being Martha Stillwell, the daughter of a farmer living near his father. The attachment was reciprocated, and the young couple exchanged words of love-and eternal fidelity during their happy courtship. He was nearly 19 and she three years his junior. Bazil, whose love gave him confidence, boldly asked consent of Martha's parents to their marriage. Her father liked his frank and kindly ways and favored *the match, but dame Stillwell had higher aspirations for her daughter. Shs wished her to wed the, possessor of broad acres and not a penniless young man. Besides, how could she spare her daughter yet? No, she would not give her consent. Grieved were the lovers at this decision, but by no means obedient to the behest of the stern mother. In clandestine interviews they renewed their pledges of affection, and encouraged by Martha's father, planned an elopement. Indeed, we suspect Mr. Stillwell was the chief conspirator, and most efficient aid did he render. The day was set, but the suspicious mother kept close watch on her daughter. How to arrange her wedding outfiL without the mother's knowledge puzzled the three comspirators. The simple trousseau was mostly made by stealth, in Martha's own room

ELOPEMENT AND MARRIAGE.

at night, she receiving some little assistance from a sister also in the secret, but she happened to be entirely out of shoes, for it was in March, and young ladies then were not ashamed to be seen in their bare feet while in the house, and very crude brogans when the weather made covering for the feet necessary. But the etiquette of Greencastle, in 1790, did not permit a bride to appear shoeless and slipperless at her wedding. Ready made, shoes were unknown in the town, and the needed articles must be made to measure Several plans failed, and her father was compelled to move cautiously, in view of the fact that Dame Stillwell was somewhat suspicious. The matter was delayed for a favorable opportunity, until the day before the wedding, when further procrastination being out of the question, the father invented a ruse to accomplish the object. In the forenoon of the last day of grace, he came into the weaving room where mother and daughters were at work at the loom, and shortly began to joke Martha on the size of her feet. Picking up a shingle (carefully placed within reach beforehand for the purpose) he drew a diagram of measurement of her pedal extremities, the dimensions of which he laughed immoderately about with his wife, to the apparent great discomfiture of his daughter; and then carelessly threw the shingle out of the window. Fifteen minutes after, that shingle measure was in shoemaker Wilkins' shop and that worthy cobbler worked half the night to finish the pumps in which the runaway bride was to stand at her wedding on the morrow. The next day at dinner time Martha slipped away, and, with her father for a witness, she and Bazil were made one by the village justice. The out witted mother of course was indignant at first but soon relented, and thus March 17, 1790, was begun tfie matrimonial journey of Bazil Harrison and Martha Stillwell, and for nearly 70 years did the two live together as man and wife, until June 7, 1857, the union was broken by her death. Bazil and his wife remained in Franklin county for three or four years whpn they moved across the Alleghanies into Washington county, where they lived until 1810, and during that time nine children were born unto them, viz. William, Shadrack, Sally, Nathan, Cynthia, Ephraim, Worlender, Martha, and two others who died young. It was in Franklin county that Bazil cast his first vote. In 1792 he voted for Washington for his second term, and he has voted at every presidentia election since then, except in 1828 and J872, in which latter year he was too ill to get to the polls, though he was especially desirous as he said, to vote *'once more for Gtant." In 1810 with his family he removed to Kentucky, just opposite Cincinnati, at which latter place he stopped to visit his cousin, Gen. Harrison. He was engaged in distilling in that region for about two years. After Gen. Harrison had gained his battle over Tecumseh at Tippe

canoe, and hostilities broke out with England, he engaged his cousin Bazil to work his Millbrook farm, just below Cincinnati, when he assumed command of the northwest frontier. Our hero was a man that disliked strife, though he did not lack courage. He was not in the war of 1812, but sent a substitute, in the person of his younger brother Ephraim. During the war he lived on his cousin's farm, "working it on shares," and shortly after peace was declared he bought a farm of 300 acres twelve miles\east of Springfield. His oldest son, William, bought and partly paid for a farm near his father's, and both remaind there for ten or twelve years. It was at this time, subsequent to the war, that there was so much excitement about titles to real estate all through Ohio, growing out of military claims. Mr. Harrison was prospering finely, and settled during his occupancy no less than three military claims, on his thus dearly bought farm, but when a fourth one was preferred he lost his patience and declared he would not buy it up, but would "buy a farm of Uncle Sam first." The holders of the claim offered comparatively easy terms, charging only $600 or $700, which, of course, was nothing like the value of the farm. But Mr. Harrison could not accept the terms offered, and rather than pay for his farm the fifth time, resolved to abandon it entirely, and go to Michigan, from which territory his son Elias had returned the year before. Elias had lived one season just over the Michigan line from La Grange Co., Ind., but had returned to Ohio with glowing accounts of the fertile prairies that skirted the southern border of the state. At the time Mr. Harrison decided to "go west" (northwest, to speak accurately), Cynthia, the oldest living daughter, married to Henry Whipple, was living on a farm near Jefferson, Champaign county, and Ephraim was carrying on a blacksmith shop near his father's place. The younger children were living at home. Once decided tp start for a new home that he might get settled there before winter, he hurriedly sold off most of his stock and all of his household goods that he could not carry with him. The territory of Michigan at that time was an almost unknown country. Yet some bold and adventurous men had penetrated its recesses and brought back to their homes in the east, wonderful stories of its splendid timber, its magnificent prairies, its park-like openings, its rivers, lakes and streams, the rank growth of vegetation here, and the promise it gave of reward and wealth to the farmer and man of enterprise. These recitals had the effect to make the territory much talked about and the subject of many schemes of settlement. All eyes were turned to Michigan. To Mr. Harrison with his large family and in his mood of mind it was just the place for him. And he had no difficulty in securing comprany for his migratory journey. His oldest son William was anxious to go, but could hot get away until the next year. Ephraim, the

206 IMEGRATION TO MICHIGAN. blacksmith, was ready with little preparation. Judge's son-in-law, Whipple, with his wife and three children, responded to the invitation, and announced their readiness to leave their rented farm. Abraham and Ephraim Davidson, neighbors, also volunteered, and the party rendezvoused at the Judge's farm* We can not fix the exact date of their starting, but think it was about the 20th of September. The party numbered 21 persons, as follows; Bazil Harrison and Martha Harrison, his wife; Henry Whipple and his wife Cynthia Harrison Whipple, and two children; Ephraim Harrison, wife and three children; Abraham Davidson, wife and one child; Ephraim Davidson, and the following unmarried children of Mr. Harrison; Elias S., Worlender, Bazil, jr., Martha, John S., and Almira. As they set out from the deserted homestead, with their eyes turned toward a new and unsettled country where they were to seek a new home, they formed quite an emigrant train. First, no doubt, came the old fashioned, great Pennslyvania wagon. That was none of your modern vehicles, but was so deep that a man standing onits floor could scarcely see over its side. It was long and high and broad, and it was very capacious. The box was boat-shaped-top, bottom and sides, though not at the ends, generally painted blue, and the outside furnished with panels made of slats or moulding. The wheels, tires, axles, &c., were all made on the same scale of size and strength. To this conveyance was hitched'two spans of horses. The harnesses used were quite another thing from those we see now-they were in keeping with the style of the wagons-an immense amount of leathern broad bands, no collars, and hames plain as a pike staff and as strong. Then came four other "wide track Ohio wagons," all but one drawn by two horses, the exception being preceded by a yoke of sturdy oxen. One of the four "Ohio wagons" with the horses that.drew it belonged to Whipple, one to Abe Davidson, one to Ephraim Harrison, and, the other, as well as the "Pennsylvania vehicle," to the patriarch of the party. There was also a light single horse wagon in which rode Mrs. Harrison and her daughters. Then there were three cows, fifty head of sheep, and nearly as many hogs. Their good byes said to their neighbors and friends the night before, except the few who rose before the sun to say the last farewell and God speed,-some of the party with full hearts and tear dimmed eyes, and the little children full of wonderment at the vastness of the preparations,--early on that September morning the little colony bade adieu to the old homestead, and the cavalcade moved slowly away to the north, under the leadership of Judge Harrison, the hale and hearty commander of 57, the younger men acting as aids in executing his commands. Slowly they moved forward, for the younger boys must herd the sheep and drive the swine that needed urging to pass on

THE JOURNEY.

without stopping to wallow in the mud puddles by the roadside-puddles made large by the early fall rains and very inviting to eyes of the grunting awine, and the youthful masters were helped by faithful dogs to prevent the sheep and swine from straying from the track. As the cortege wound around the hill and into the woods the little children and their mothers leaned back and strained their eyes to catch the last look at the old home they were leaving behind forever. Thus they set out upon their long and fatiguing journey, not knowing where it was to end, but hoping that they would find at its terminus a home, that, though it 'might be in a new, strange country, would be free from the menaces of claim holders, and wherethey would enjoy the fall reward of their labor and toil. The course of the journey was first through Urbana, even then a brisk and busy town, thence west to Piqua, and north along the bank of the Miami to Sidney, where they left the river and continued north to St. Mary's. Onaward they pushed through Anglaize and Van Wert counties, crossing the state line into Indiana a little south of where Dixon now is. Though the roads in Ohio were comparatively good, they were obliged to move forward by short day's journeys, for long marches could not be made, driving the sheep and swine in advance, and the first days of October were upon them before they reached Fort Wayne. Their last two or three days' journey had given them a foretaste of what was before them. As they left behind them the fertile fields of Ohio, in which could be seen from the road the golden ripened corn, the country was newer and the homes were less frequent. After the Indiana border was crossed there were no cornfields in sight until the outskirts of Fort Wayne were reached, and occasionally Indians gave them salutations on the road. A day's halt only was made at Fort Wayne to gather some information concerning the new country to which they were bound. Fort Wayne was then upon the border of settlement and civilization. The course of our pioneers thence was northwest, and they had scarcely any road but Indian trails. It would be an interesting picture to gaze upon now, in the light of modern times, that pioneer colony wending their way through the forests primevalthe almost trackless wilderness. We can see them in our mind's eye as they left the last haunts of civilization, halting' a moment before plunging inito the unknown wastes of wilderness, the end of which was unknown, and the shadows of the dark and mysterious land already thrilled them with vague forebodings. With a fervent prayer to the ever protecting Father, and with something of that feeling which Cortez felt when he burned his ships on the coasts of the New World, determined to conquer or perish, this little band strike into a trail that leads them into woods without roads, for a destination

208 A LAND OF BEAUTY. for which they as yet had no fixed idea. Very slowly they pursued their way, meeting with obstacles and obstructions continually; sometimes following a stream for hours before a safe crossing could be found; often stopping to remove great trees they could not go around, and almost numberless difficulties which we have not space here to detail. In one instance it took them seven days to go around a swamp that lay in their path, and sometimes when they halted for the night they could look back and see the smoke rising from the embers of the camp fire they had left in the morning. At night a watch lire was built and then the wolves and other wild beasts were kept away from the stock, closely guarded, though all through the night the howls and screams of the denizens of the forest were heard. But there were compensations for these drawbacks. Every step forward was a new revelation, and the journey continual sensation of wonder and delight. How gorgeous were the woods in those autumn days, ag our party wended their way. New combinations of colors every day, new trees, new forms of vegetation, new varieties of country, from the hilly slope deeply wooded, heavy bottom lands along pearly winding streams, vast meadows, splendid openings looking like carefully tended parks; prairies like seas stretching in airy undulations far away, or lakes like silver mirrors bordered with emerald. The woods were fall of wild fruits of vari-n ous kinds, game abounded, the air was crisp and dry, and the sight and song of birds made the darkest recesses merry. Through Allen and Noble counties they malle their way, across the rich alluvial "plains of Goshen," and over the beautiful Elkhart prairie to the border line of Michigan territory. On their way the party had found only here and there a rudecab in and an occasional trader's house. There were on Elkhart prairie scarcely any settlers. The beautiful land was especially attractive to several of the party, and some were inclined strongly to stop there and go no further, looking upon this as the promised. land, Mr. Whipple especially urging that the colony ought to locate there. But Indiana had been a state a dozen years, and Mr. Harrison adventurously desired to push on a1nl make his home in the new territory, and so they journeyed on till they arrived at Baldwin's Prairie, just south of the state line. Here they halted; a temporary camp was made; it being decided that scouts should go forward to spy out the land, Mr. Harrison selected Whipple, Abraham Davidson and Elias IIarrison to go with him, the latter having acquired some acquaintance with the Indian tongue. This party was gone a week, and soon after they set out they learned from the Indians that a great prairie, the largest in the territory, would be found less than forty miles north of the southern territorial line. This was in confirmation of other stories they heard from huntcrs and traders, and the scouts pushed forward until they reached the southern



Page 209
SETTLEMENT.

209

edge of the prairie, a view of which fully satisfied them of the truthfulness of the descriptions they had heard. Mr. Harrison quickly decided to return and conduct the colony thither. With this idea fully fixed in his mind, Mr. Harrison and his colony broke camp again and set out upon their final march, and after a few days traveling, on the evening of the fifth day of November, 1828, just at dusk, they lighted their camp fires on the southeastern edge of Prairie Ronde, or Wa-we-os-co-tang-scotah, as the Indians call it, meaning the "round fire plain," whence comes the French "Prairie Ronde." As the party retired to rest that night they felt that the end of their journey had been reached. Before them was the greatest and loveliest prairie they had ever seen, and Mr. Harrison and those with him were satisfied to look no further. For perhaps the eye of man has rarely rested on a more beautiful natural landscape than was presented by Prairie Ronde" Before the white man marred it with his plow." Ascending slightly from the circumference to the center, yet so as to seem full rather than elevated; surrounded with a noble forest whose sharp-cut and perfect line was nowhere so distant as to be indistinct, yet so remote that the beams of the rising and setting sun seemed to blend in a mist of gold and purple, the whole plain was covered from spring to autumn with a gorgeous array of flowers, whose differing colors followed each other in due succession; at last faded and gone in the autumn winds"The tall, rank spike grass waved its bristly head." It was such a scene of unrivalled beauty that opened to the view of the first white settler of Prairie Ronde. The next morning the whole party were up betimes, and while they were breakfasting around the cheerful fire in the clear, crisp air of early day, Sagamaw, the chief of the Pottawattomies, accompanied by ten or a dozen of his braves, all decked in gay costumes, and faces resplendent with paint, came to their camp and made friendly overtures. Sagamaw was a magnificent specimen of the aborigine. His looks, his manners, his fine presence and the evident good will which was apparent to all, inspired confidence in the pale faces, and they freely questioned him as best they could by signs and the few words of Indian language they understood, as to where water could be had, and in regard to such matters as most interested our pioneers at this time. Sagamaw gave them all the information he could convey to them, and the result was that the Indians conducted Mr. Harrison and two others of the party across the prairie to the northwestiside, where within the line of wooda 27

THE PRAIRIE COLONY.

was a little lake-now known as Harrison's lake. Mr. Harrison needed no further argument to convince him that this was the proper place for him to locate. He quickly returned, and the whole party were that night encamped on the banks of the little lake where, for nearly a half a century, he has lived. Here the party at once made arrangements to live, erected a rude cabin and, before winter set in, were as comfortable as they could be made under the circumstances. The land was divided among the children, and subsequently entered at the land office at Monroe; but all lived together through the first winter. The following spring, Mr. Harrison and his sons plowed land and planted corn and buckwheat, having obtained the seed from White Pigeon, where they also bought some more sheep. This gave them a good start. The second year they were short of seed, for wheat was very high and difficult to obtain, being worth seven dollars per bushel. They had to go to Fort Wayne for it, and for what grain they had ground they had to travel to Tolland's mill at Elkhart, Indiana. But the woods were full of game, the Indians were friendly and no untoward event occurred to discourage the colonists. By this time, too, quite a little addition was made to the settlement. Christopher Bair came to the prairie and settled near the Harrisons in 1829, and Abner Calhoun, Abram J. Shaver, Erastus Guilford, Win. Duncan, George Brown, John Insley, David Beadle, and others had come the winter before. In 1830 there were some sixty families on the prairie and vicinity, and measures were taken to organize a township government. A township meeting was held December 14, 1830, under a call "to the electors of the township of Brady, in Kalamazoo county," at the house of Abner Calhoun, on Prairie Ronde. At this election Christopher Bair was elected township clerk; Bazil Harrison, Stephen Hoyt and William Bishop, commissioners of highways; Joel Clark, Stephen Hoyt, Abiel Fellows and Abram I. Shaver, school commissioners. In April, the following year, Edwin H. Lothrop was elected supervisor, and H. B. Huston township clerk. Judge Harrison was subsequently chosen a justice of the peace, and was commissioned by Gov. Cass one of the associate judges of the county court, and acted in that capacity till 1834, if we remember rightly. The names of Judge Harrison's seventeen children were, William, Sarah, Nathan, Shadrack, Ephraim, Joseph, Cynthia, Elias S., Worlender, Bazil, Martha, Rachel, Amanda, John S., Almira, and Diana. Besides these sixteen, one child, an infant, died before it received a name. Of these, eight are now living. William, the oldest, now 83, is a farmer in Climax. He is halo and hearty, spry as a boy of 15, thinks nothing of a tehn mile walk, and

can run a foot race with any of his neighbors apd win it. We have never seen so remarkable a case of preserved physical vigor. When the writer called upon him last summer, without the least fatigue on his part, he led us on an half mile tramp, at a pace we could scarcely keep up with. Every tooth in his head is sound, and his eyesight good. He boasts his ability to "down" any of his sons in a "squarehold" wrestle, and they, though men of more than ordinary strength and muscle, admit that his boast is not without foundation. Nathan, well known to the pioneers of this village as the "river ferryman," forty years ago, lives in Bloomfield, Ill., in rather feeble health. Cynthia Harrison Whipple lives in Lake City, state of Minnesota, as does also Woilender Harrison Fellows. Dr. Bazil Harrison lives on Prairie Ronde, on a farm adjoining the old homestead, upon which lives John S., the youngest son, with whom the aged judge made his home. Martha Harrison Bishop lives at Fairwater, Wis., and Mrs. Almira Harrison Crose, the youngest surviving child, lives on Prairie Ronde. Sarah, the first daughter, and second child, died while young, in Pennsylvania, as did Shadrack, the third son. Ephraim died in Minneapolis, Minn., a few years ago. Elias died in Lake City, Minn., and Rachael died very young in Clarke county, Ohio. Amanda and Diana also died in Clarke councy. As above stated, there are eight children living. There are also eightyone grandchildren. It is impossible for us to tell just how many greatgrandchildren are living, for they are scattered all over the -west, but there are twelve great-great-grandchildren that Mr. J. Harrison's family know of. Counting the four generations of children, grandchildren, great-grandchildren, and great-great-grandchildren, the progeny of Judge HIarrison now numbers, as nearly as can be ascertained, 220 persons, all living. Judge Harrison always enjoyed the esteem and confidence of his neighbors, white as well as red. He was frank, open hearted, generous; naturally a peace maker, he became the arbiter in all matters of dispute-and his decisions were always satisfactory. Judge Harrison, from the time the smoke from the hearth of his log cabin ascended to the pure skies, was always ready to "welcome the coming, speed the parting guest." lie furnished hospitality to all comers, and shared what he had with settlers who stood in need. The Indians admired his tall, athletic form, his abundant good nature, his unswerving integrity and fair dealing, and to his neighbors he was a refuge in times of trouble. With his numerous children around him, he was in a measure independent, and enabled to overcome difficulties which others could not so ably cope with. An anecdote is related of him which illustrates the peace loving qualities of Judge Harrison. Christopher Bair and a neighbor got into a quarrel about the breaking down of a wagon which Mr. Bair had



Page 212

PART IN PUBLIC AFFAIRS.

borrowed. One of the boxes to an axle was broken somehow, and it was not clear to whom belonged the duty of repairing the loss; a lawsuit and hard feelings were likely to grow out of this matter. When Judge Harrison heard of this, he took a box from an assortment which he brought with him from Ohio, placed it upon the axle, and that settled the difficulty. He has been known to ride all day for the purpose of bringing about an amicable settlement of a difference between neighbors. It has been a matter of general belief for many years that Judge Harrison was the "'Bee Hunter" of Cooper's novel, the "Oak Openings," the scene of which, it will be remembered, is laid in Kalamazoo. Since the publication of the work, this has been the accepted theory among the pioneers of the county and Judge Harrison's neighbors. We never heard the fact questioned until last year, when Judge H. G. Wells informed us that Mr. Cooper told him after the appearance of the book, that his character of "Ben Boden, the Bee Hunter," was not founded on Judge Harrison, but on Towner Savage, one of the pioneers of the county, and a bee hunter by avocation. This being so, Mr. Cooper must have made contradictory statements, for Mrs. J. B. Daniels, of this village, is very positive and clear in her recollection that Mr. Cooper repeatedly named Judge Harrison as the original of the character mentioned. Fenimore Cooper, as is well known, had considerable property interests in Kalamazoo county at one time, the township just north of it deriving its name from him, He made several long continued visits to Kalamazoo, along in the "forties," and one, if we mistake not, as late as 1850, the year before his death. Mrs. Daniels was well acquainted with him, and he counted her as one of his favored friends. She met him frequently!during his visits and relates to us one occasion in particular upon which Judge Harrison's connection with the story was discussed. This was one day, probably in the summer of 1846, when Mr. Cooper was the guest of Mr. Comstock, and at the time he was writing the book. On that day, Mrs.. Daniels tells us, Mr. Cooper spent hours talking with her and others of the guests about Judge Harrison, his family and pioneer history, his relations with the Indians, his bee hunting proclivities, and various other matters connected with the early settlement of Kalamazoo and the country hereabouts. It was known then that he was writing a book, the scene of which was laid here, and he made no concealment of the purpose for which he sought his information, and stated openly the character he proposed to make out of Judge Harrison. Mrs. Daniels had come to Kalamazoo when a little girl, in 1834, and was well acquainted with the Harrisons as well as all of The early settlers. She was one well prepared to give such information as Mr. Cooper sought, and he afterward acknowledged her services in this respect, by pre

213

senting her with a copy of the "Oak Openings," and at that time he told her that Judge Harrison was the original of the "Bee Hunter." Mrs. Daniels also informs us that in frequent conversations with the old Judge he has stated to her that he understood that he was the person Cooper had in mind when he created "Buzzing Ben" and also that he had been so informed by Cooper himself. Last year we ourselves questioned Judge Harrison on this point, but his mind was not then clear enough to comprehend the question. We have made a great deal of research to fix the identity of the " Bee Hunter" beyond question, and have talked with scores of old settlers. While we have found but few who claimed to have any direct information on the subject, all of the testimony, except that of Judge Wells, has been to confirm the theory that Bazil Harrison was the original of Mr. Cooper's character. Dozens of well known citizens have related to us an account of a conversation alleged to have taken place between Judge Harrison and Mr. Cooper, at the time of the novelist's last visit to Kalamazoo-the anecdote having been current ever since the incident is said to have occurred. Judge Harrison, so the story runs, having been interviewed by Mr. Cooper, after the introduction, remarked, "So you got me into your book, Mr. Cooper? " "Yes," replied Mr. Cooper; "I had to have some one, judge, and-you seemed to be about the right sort of person to make my bee hunter out of." "Well, Mr. Cooper, you are a smart man, or at least they say you are, but you ought to know better than to make a bee light on clover. They are too smart for that; they don't fool away with red clover when there's sweeter flowers easier to get at-" "Oh, I meant white clover," interrupted Mr. Cooper. "Well," responded the judge, "you are a smart man, Mr. Cooper, at any rate they say you are, but you ought to know that there wasn't any white clover here at the time you speak of. White clover don't come till after settlers come." The judge is also represented as tripping up Mr. Cooper on other alleged inaccuracies. It seems curious that such a story should have been started twenty four years ago, and been repeated constantly ever since, if there was no foundation for it. It is well known, too, that Judge Harrison was an inveterate bee hunter. His %ldest son tells us that after his father saw a bee, he was never satisfied until he found the honey, and often would leave his work to follow up the bee and secure his store of sweets. Thinking that some of Mr. Cooper's notes might be in existence that would throw light on the subject, we addressed a note to his son, Paul F. Cooper, Esq., an attorney at law in Albany, and he promised to make

search. Afterward when in Albany the writer called on Mr. Cooper, who then told us that he had made search and talked with other members of the family but was unable to find or learn anything that would aid us in our search. We are forced to the conclusion, however, that Mr. Cobper must havs had Judge Harrison in his mind when he drew the picture of "Buzzing Ben," the bee hunter, though of course his portraiture may have included characteristics found in Towner Savage or other settlers. Mr. Harrison took an active part in politics, and his name is found as a delegate in nearly all of the conventions held for many years. He was an original democrat, of the Jackson school, and had little confidence in the opposing parties until the formation of the republican party under the oaks at Jackson. So strong was his attachment for the democratic party that he could not give it up for the ties of kindred, and in 1840 he did not vote for his cousin for president. His first republican vote was cast in 1860 for Lincoln. There are many who remember his tall, slightly bent form and flowing white beard and his clear eye when he came do*n from the prairie to the political meetings. During the war he read the papers with great interest, with such assiduity, indeed, that his eyesight was nearly destroyed. He watched the course of the contest with the liveliest interest, and no one rejoiced with greater enthusiasm at the triumph of the government over its bitter enemies. For several years past Judge Harrison has scarcely ventured away from homo. His faculties were becoming dimmed by age, and the sands of his life were running low. He, however, has had days of brightness when he talked intelligently with his family and friends who came to visit him. Several times within the past two years has he related to us incidents of his early life, which stood clear in his memory, while later events were clouded. Last year, at the meeting of the pioneers of the county, held at Schoolcraft, he was present and shook hands with many old friends whom he recognized, and talked freely. He said among other things, "I am 102 years old, and, thank God, I have not an enemy in the world!" This statement was true. He never did ill to any one. Just in his dealings and blameless in his life, he has passed from earth leaving no enemies behind. He was, for over seventy years, a consistent member of the Methodist church, and has related to us the story of his conversion. His habits of life were simple, and he enjoyed almost uniform good health. He was, until the later years of his life, of strong physical vigor, and unusual powers of endurance. He was successful a3 a farmer, and influential among his neighbors.

history of the world have been enacted, the brightest pages of progress have been written, the noblest men have fulfilled their missions and passed away. Far beyond the time allotted to man's life, he has lived to see his children grow to old age, and his children's children filling useful positions in the world. His days have been full of comfort and enjoyment, his lines have been cast in pleasant places, and peace, like a beautiful halo, settled around the lingering sunset of his life. Patiently, and with full confidence in the sublime promises of Him who created worlds and time and man, he awaited the welcome summons for this mortal to put on immortality, to renew his youth in the fountains of Eternal Life, and at last passed away, "Like one who wraps the drapery of his couch About him, and lies down to pleasant dreams 1" What changes have taken place since his birth-March 15, 17711 Our own republic was not born, American independence was scarcely dreamed of. The Boston massacre had aroused public excitement, it is true, but no general conflict of arms between the colonies and the mother country was deemed probable. It was thirty months before the tea was "put to steep" in Boston Harbor, and more than five years before Jefferson reported the immortal Declaration to the Continental Congress in Independence Hall. Washington, not yet forty years of age, was tilling his farm at Mt. Vernon, little imagining the great future before him. In 1771, Franklin was yet hale and hearty at 65; John Adams was 36, and John Quincy a boy of four; Jefferson was only 28; Madison was 20; Hamilton 14 and Burr 15; Monroe was 13 and Jackson had been born on the same day of the same month four years before. Every other president was his junior, as was Henry Clay by six years anct Webster by eleven. In England, George III, aged 33, was on the throne in the eleventh year of his 60 years reign, with Lord North as prime minister. The first earl of Caatham was yet alive, and his son, the younger Pitt, a boy of 12, was fitting for Cambridge. Burke at41 was in the zenith of his greatness, and Warren Hastings was in India, though not as governor general till three years later. Grattan was only 21 and not yet admitted to the bar; Charles Fox, though only 22, was in parliament, and had been for three years; Walpole had been out of parliament only three years, and Wilberforce, only 12 years of age, did not enter the House of Commons until nine years later. Nelson, who was killed thirty four years later at Trafalgar, was only 13 and serving as a midshipman on the Raisonnable; Arthur Wellesley, afterwards Duke of \Vellington, an infant of less than two years, was doubtless creeping about Dungan Castle, and for years afterward a very stupid child, history says, giving no promise of future greatness but regarded as the "dunce of the family."

Watt had received his first patent for a steam engine only two years before, and his first engines on a large scale were erected four years later. The steamboat was not tried as an experiment until thirty years later, and Fulton's Clermont did not float on the Hudson until 1807. Our centenarian was comparatively an old man (sixty seven) when the first steamei crossed the Atlantic.

It is now nearly a century since the wilderness of forest and swamp, with now and then a bit of prairie, lying north of the Ohio river and west of the borders of Pennsylvania, and reaching to the Mississippi river, was permanently organized as the Northwest Territory. This vast territory had been claimed for years by several states of the confederacy, under decidedly conflicting, and perhaps doubtful titles. " New

THE NORTHWEST TERRITORY-BOUNDARIES. 217 York claimed it under the Six Nations, who, by their martial prowess, had established a certain undefined and only partially admitted supremacy over the tribes of the region, and who had themselves acknowledged subordination to the jurisdiction of New York. Virginia, Massachusetts and Connecticut claimed all or parts of it under the vague and uncertain terms of their charters, and Virginia claimed also by virtue of * * conquest." New York, in March, 1781, was the first to bede its claim to the territory to the general government; Massachusetts in 1785 was the last. In the interval all of the states claiming jurisdiction over any portions of the territory ceded their claims to the confederacy, although the cession of Connecticut, which contained a reservation of the lands now a part of the state of Ohio, and known as the " Western Reserve," was not accepted by Congress until 1786. The confederacy had thus, at this latter date, obtained title to all the territory, and July 13th of the following year, enacted the ordinance of 1787, "for the government of the territory northwest of the Ohio." This act was undoubtedly more far reaching in its effects than any of its supporters conceived, and of it Judge Cooley speaks in glowing terms. He says, "This was the immortal ordinance of 1787, * * * * *; immortal for the grand results which have followed from its adoption, not less than for the wisdom and far seeing statesmanship that conceived and gave form to its provisions." It is with the provisions of the fifth article of this ordinance that we are particularly concerned in this inquiry. This article provided generally that " There shall be formed in said territory, not less than three, nor more than five states," and then went on to establish the boundaries for the proposed states. The boundaries of the three states first to be' erected were, the Ohio on the south and Mississippi on the west, and the present boundary lines between Indiana and Illinois and Indiana and Ohio, extended to the territorial boundary line on the north. Then follows this proviso: " Provided, however, and it is further understood and declared that the boundaries of these three states shall be subject so far to be altered, that if Congress hereafter find it expedient, they shall have authority to form one or two states in that part of said territory which lies north of an east and west line drawn through the southerly bond or extrene of Lake Michigan." Ohio was the first state to be erected from the territory, and April 30, 1802, Congress provided for its admission by an enabling act, under which the state was organized. This act described the northern boundary line of the proposed state in the following words: "and on the north by an east and west line drawn through the southerly extreme of Lake Michigan and running east 28

BOUNDARIES-A CONTROVERSY.

after intersecting the north line aforesaid, from the mouth of the Great Miami," (that is the boundary between Indiana and Ohio) "until it shall intersect Lake Erie, to the Pennsylvania line aforesaid." After the organization 6f Ohio the balance of the territory went under the name of Indiana territory, and so remained until Michigan territory was set off by virtue of an act of Congress approved January 11, 1805. The boundaries of Michigan territory were described in the following terms: "All that part of the Indiana territory which lies north of a line drawn east from the southerly bend or extreme of Lake Michigan, until it shall intersect Lake Erie, and east of a line drawn from the said southerly bend, through the middle of said lake, to its northern extremity, and thence due north to the northern boundary of the United States, shall for the purpose of temporary government, constitute a separate territory, and be called Michigan." All the congressional legislation, then, up to 1805, recognizes the line drawn through the southerly extreme of Lake Michigan, extending due east until it should intersect Lake Erie, or the territorial line, to be the established boundary between Michigan and Ohio and Michigan and Indiana. There would seem, then, to be no ground for controversy between the several states, at least so far as relates to congressional legislation. A controversy did arise, however, based in part on the supposed intention and understanding of the members of Congress in regard to the legislation just cited. It was not exactly known where the line passing through the southerly extreme of Lake Michigan would intersect Lake Erie, but it was supposed it would be very near the present northern boundary of Ohio. In fact, the southerly extreme of Lake Michigan was farther south than had been supposed, and a line drawn due east from it would intersect Lake Erie somewhere near the mouth of the Cuyahoga river. This fact was undoubtedly known to tho convention which adopted the constitution under which Ohio was admitted; at least they considered it probable that it might intersect Lake Eric at some point below the mouth of the Maumee. In the Ohio constitution of 1802 the sixth section of the seventh article declares the state to be bounded "on the north by an east and west line drawn through the southerly extreme of Lake Michigan, running east after intersecting the due north line aforesaid, from the mouth of the Great Miami," (that is the boundary lino between Ohio and Indiana) "until it shall intersect Lake Erie or the territorial line," etc. "Provided, always, and it is hereby fully understood and declared by this convention, that if the southerly bend or extreme of Lake Michigan should extend so far south, that a line drawn due east from it should not intersect Lake Erie, or if it should intersect east of the Miami river of the lake, then, and in that case, with the assent of the Congress of:-i i L.. &I?

CLAIMS OF OHIO.

219

the United States, the northern boundary of this state, shall be established by, and extended to, a direct line running from'the southern extremity of Lake Michigan, to the most northerly cape of the Miami bay, after intersecting the due north line from the Great Miami," etc. The act of Congress of February 19, 1803, which recognized Ohio as a state, makes no allusion to the boundaries in the body of the act, but the preamble recites that, "the people of the eastern division of the territory northwest of the the river Ohio, did, on the 29th day of November" 1802 " form themselves a constitution and state government" * * * * "in pursuance of an act of Congress" * *, '* "whereby the said state has become one of the United States of America." The authorities of Ohio claimed this to be an implied assent on the part of Congress to the boundary proposed in the proviso of the article of their constitution already cited. They further based their claims on a supposed preference of the people residing in the territory in contest for the government of the state of Ohio; and a supposed intention of Congress to give Ohio the entire southern shore of Lake Erie, based probably on a further supposition that Congress, in selecting the line passing due east through the southern extreme of Lake Michigan, believed it to intersect Lake Erie above the mouth of the Maumee, and thus laid it out under a mistake. Judge Campbell in speaking of this latter claim says: " It is a mere assumption to claim that the Congress of 1787 laid it out under a mistake, or intended to give the eastern state the entire southern shore of Lake Erie, or any specific part of it." And farther on says: " There is no evidence that Congress paid any attention to this question or cared where the line fell; inasmuch as it was subject to their future discretion whether to run the line at all or not." The territory which was in dispute extends the entire length of the northern boundary of Ohio, until it meets Lake Erie,,bcing about five miles wide at the west end and eight miles wide at the east end; and within its bounds is the mouth of the Maumee, now a valuable and important harbor, and the flourishing city of Toledo. It is probable that the possible importance of this harbor had much to do in influencing the action of the Ohio authorities. Quoting from an address of W. W. Way, of Perrysburg, Ohio, read at Tecumseh, Michigan, in 1868: "The state of Ohio as early as 1825, contemplated the construction of a navigable canal from the Ohio river at Cincinnati to the navigable waters of the Maumee. The canal was constructed as far north as Piqua and there terminated for'a number of years, * * * In 1835 * * * * the people in the northwest became clamorous for the extension of the canal north to its completion. S

THE CONTROVERSY UNSETTLED.

"By this time the navigation of the Maumee to the foot of the rapids, at Perrysburg and Maumee," two small towns about ten miles from Toledo, "was ascertained to be not as good as to Toledo, and therefore the authorities of the state deemed it of the utmost consequence to have the territory including Toledo, for the termination of the canal." From the time of the admission of Ohio until it became certain that Michigan was about to become a member of the Union, the matter in controversy remained unsettled, neither party making any active effort to obtain the territory in dispute. The authorities of Michigan were exercising jurisdiction over this territory, and representatives of Ohio in Congress were making efforts on every possible occasion to have that body in some manner assent to the proposed boundary already noticed, and Congress as often striking from proposed measures, provisions looking towards that end. And every action taken by Congress in the matter up to the final settlement did recognize the' right of the territory of Michigan to exercise jurisdiction over the disputed ground. The land in contest was a part of Wayne county, and was so recognized by the authorities of Ohio in selecting delegates to form a constitution under the congressional enabling act of 1802. The act itself cut off Wayne county "from a voice or interest in the new state;" and delegates from Wayne county were not admitted to the Ohio convention. An effort to have the exact line ascertained was provided for by an act of Congress of May 20, 1812, which provided "that the surveyor general, under the direction of the president, * * * * * cause to be surveyed, marked and designated so much of the western and northern boundaries of the state of Ohio, * * * not already * * * ascertained, as divides" Ohio "from the territories of Michigan and Indiana." Under the provisions of this act the surveyor general in 1817 directed one William Harris to run the line. He surveyed a line in that year, commencing at the easterly end of the most northerly cape of Maumee bay and running thence west towards the southerly bend of Lake Michigan until it intersected the western boundary of Ohio. This line is commonly called " Harris' line " in distinction from another line run at a later date under the supervision of the treasury department, which was dissatisfied with the line as run by Harris. This line was also run under the supervision of the surveyor general, by John A. Fulton and called "Fulton's line," and more nearly corresponds with what would be the correct line as declared in the congressional legislation already cited. The running of "Harris' line" was of sufficient importance for Gov. Cass to take notice of it, which he does in a letter to Surveyor General Tiffin. The letter so fully states the claims of Michigan as subsequently asserted

that I have inserted some portions of it. Writing under date of November 1, 1817, he says: "Report says that the line, which has been recently run, purporting to be the line between the state of Ohio and %this territory, was not run a due east course from the southern extremity of Lake Michigan to Lake Erie, but a course somewhat to the north of this, although how much I am unable to ascertain." Then referring to the steal perpetrated in the admission of Indiana, says: "And, although the boundary of Indiana was extended contrary to these provisions" referring to the acts of 1787 and 1805, "ten miles north, yet I believe it was done unadvisedly, and will, when this territory is heard in the legislature of the nation, be a subject for revision and examination." Following this he recites the proviso of the Ohio constitution and says: "This proposition has never been acceded to by Congress, and if the construction which was put upon the articles of compact," the ordinance of 1787, "be correct, no agreement even by that body, without our consent, could alter these lines." "Why should the boundaries of Ohio be enlarged at the expense of this territory? It is only adding strength to the strong, and making the weak still weaker. Even with the boundaries secured by the ordinance this territory must remain small in size and weak in population. By reducing it, its period of admission to the general confederation is indefinitely postponed. The country upon the Maumee has no natural connection with the interior of Ohio." Gov. Cass then puts some pointed questions to the surveyor general, and wishes to be informed: "How the line has been run? Why has it been run in the manner reported, if so done? and by whose instructions?" The reply of the surveyor general under date of Nov. 21, 1817, would indicate that the line had been run for the sole benefit of the state of Ohio. Amap of the survey was enclosed to General Cass, upon which the lines were drawn in the manner following: "You will observe that he'commenced his operations at the southerly extreme of Lake Michigan, and found that an east line, according to the most careful attention to his compass, etc., etc., struck Lake Erie seven miles and forty nine chains south of the most northerly cape of Miami bay. * * * He then proceleded to a direct line from the most northerly cape of Miami bay, to the southerly extreme of Lake Michigan, until he intersected the line due north from the mouth of the great Miami river of the Ohio." The surveyor general then expresses his own opinion in the matter which clearly shows his own leaning. "By the map you therefore see the two lines, and let the proper authorities say which shall govern." "But I will confess to you, that it is my opinion, clearly, that the black line is the true line." The black line referred to is the "Harris line." In spite

BECOMING A STATE.

of his opinion the Territory of Michigan continued to exercise authority over the land between "Fulton's" and "Harris' line." Governor Cass in his message to the territorial council under date of January 5, 1831, again called their attention to the matter of the disputed boundary. No active steps were taken, however, on the part of Michigan officials to obtain a settlement of the boundary line and perhaps it was not considered essential, from the fact that the territorial authorities were actually in possession and exercising acts of government over the territory in dispute. Between this time and 1835 Ohio was making successive attempts to have Congress recognize the "Harris line" as the northern boundary of the state, but none of its efforts were successful. In 1834 it became certain that Michigan would soon ask admission into the Union, and a census was ordered by the council, called together by acting Gov. Mason. This census showed that within the limits of the original territory of Michigan, as set off by the act of 1805, there were 87,273 free inhabitants, while but 60,000 inhabitants would entitle her to become a state. January 26, 1835, an act was passed appointing an election of delegates to form a constitution and state government. In pursuance of this act an election was held in April, 1835, and the convention was to meet in Detroit in May. A constitution was adopted by this convention and submitted to the people in October. This preparation on the part of the people of Michigan territory to establish a state government aroused the people of Ohio to take more active steps to protect what they conceived to be their rights. For some time prior to 1835 the counties of Wood, Henry, and Williams, in Ohio, had attempted to levy upon and collect taxes from the inhabitants of the disputed territory, but their action was repudiated by the people living there and nothing came of it. Early in 1835 "Governor Lucas, of Ohio, sent in to the legislature of that state a message asserting jurisdiction of the territory south of the mouth of the Maumee bay and urging legislation to possess and control it.' This action on the part of Ohio soon became known to the authorities of Michigan territory, and, as an attempt to forestall any further action on the part of Ohio, the legislative council on February 12, 1835, passed "An act to prevent the organization of a foreign jurisdiction within the limits of the territory of Michigan." This act provided that any person who should accept or exercise any public office in any part of the territory, except by commission from the United States or from Michigan, should upon conviction be punished by a fine not exceeding one thousand dollars, or imprisonment *~~ ~ ~ ~ ~...'I'^ fe i

not exceeding five years, or both in the discretion of the court. These severe penalties did not frighten the legislature of Ohio to any great extent, for on February 23d "the Ohio legislature passed a series of acts and resolutions asserting jurisdiction over the land ih question; declaring that measures should be taken by all the departments of the state government to establish it;" extending the counties of Wood, Henry, and Williams to Harris' line"; "and requiring all public officers to extend their authority over it." Both sides already had supporters among the inhabitants of the land in dispute, and the two parties were equally zealous in keeping their principals advised of the situation. In March certain citizens of what was known as Port Lawrence township, which then included the ground on which Toledo now stands, advised Governor Mas n that they were apprehensive of trouble and perhaps a riot on the occasion of holding the township meeting in April. The action of Governor Mason was characteristic; having at about the same time received from Columbus notification of the recent action of the Ohio legislature and of the endeavor of commissioners appointed by Governor Lucas to re-mark the "Harris line " to perform their duties, he communicates with General Brown, then in command of the 3d-division of Michigan militia, and orders him to " use every exertion to obtain the earliest information of the military movements of our adversary, as I shall assume the responsibility of sending you such, arms, etc., as may be necessary for your successful operation, without waiting for an order from the Secretary of War, so soon as Ohio is properly in the field." April 2, Governor Lucas, with his staff and the boundary commissioners, arrived aC Perrysburg, and Major General John Bell, then in command of the 17th division of Ohio militia (within whose command were the counties of Wood, Henry and Williams), was directed to assume control to the " Harris line," "and to cause all persons residing therein" * * " subject to military duty under the laws of Ohio, to be enrolled and organized under the laws of" the "state." Governor Lucas was determined to run the line and was ready with his commissioners backed by a force of militia if necessary. Governor Mason was equally determined, and issued orders to General Brown which were certainly energetic ff not prudent. General Brown was given discretionary power to call the militia into actual service, and commanded to arrest the commissioners of Ohio, using the words of the order, "the moment they stick the first stake in the soil of Michigan." Anticipating the subsequent action of Governor Lucas, General Brown is also ordered, "the moment he may learn a military force of any description, ordered out by the authorities of Ohio, is about to approach the disputed territory, to place himself with a sufficient

force of like character, on the ground in contestation, and to fire upon the first military officer or man who persists in crossing the boundary line, as at present claimed by Michigan, with any hostile intention, or disposition, or determination, to prevent his execution of the previous orders." Under these belligerent orders forces were assembled by both parties at Toledo, and feeling ran high. In a report to Gov. Lucas, Gen. Brown is reported to have assured certain citizens of the disputed ground, that before Ohio could extend her jurisdiction, "she would have to march over the dead bodies of that portion of her citizens who had heretofore been under the jurisdiction of Michigan." In the meantime the territorial authorities had communicated the condition of affairs to the authorities at Washington, and President Jackson, through the Secretary of State, advised both parties to "the exercise of mutual forbearance and prudence," and as a further means of conciliation, appointed two commissioners, Richard Rush and Benjamin 0. Howard, to confer with the governors of the belligerent states, and, if possible, effect a settlement. The entire matter had also been referred to the Attorney General, Benjamin F. Butler, of New York, who, by an opinion under date of March 21, 1835, decided the Michigan authorities to be in the right. The commissioners on the part of the United States met Gov. Lucas at Perrysburg, April 7, and there it is claimed by Gov. Lucas that an agreement was had which was entirely satisfactory. This in substance was that "the Ohio line should be run as claimed, and the people be allowed to follow their individual predilections as to which government they would obey, until the close of the next session of Congress." This arrangement was never in any manner assented to by the Michigan authorities, nor did they over act in accordance with its terms. On the contrary, they continued to arrest offenders against the statute already cited, as they had done before, and, among others, a portion of the party of the Ohio survey commissioners. Several of the persons arrested made reports to the governor of Ohio by letter, which the governor subsequently submitted to the legislature. One of them writes as follows: "Here I am peeping through the grates of a loathsome prison for the monstrous crime of having acted as the judge of an election within the state of Ohio." "Have been here fourteen hours, and no refreshments of any kind furnished. It appears probable that it is intended to soften us by starvation." Then, referring to the troops of Gov. Mason, he says: "Those bands of ruffians * * * * hanging upon the northern border of Ohio require chastisement." Up to the latter part of June an extended correspondence was carried on between Gov. Lucas and the authorities at Washington. The general tenor

225

of the letters from Washington is to the effect that the claims of Michigan were proper ones; and finally the president found it necessary to intimate to Gov. Lucas that he "might find it necessary to interfere with the power of the United States, if Ohio persisted in running the line with an armed escort." All of this correspondence was laid before the Ohio legislature by a special message, June 18, 1835. Two days later the Ohio legislature passed "an act to erect the county of Lucas," the boundaries of which included much of the territory in dispute and particularly the "seat of war," Toledo. The county was to elect its first officers in October following, and the first court of common pleas was directed to be held at Toledo on Sept. 7. Matters now remained quiet with only an occasional outbreak until it became certain that it was the intention to hold court at Toledo. This again brought matters to a crisis. The Ohio authorities had levied troops to protect the judges, and Gov. Mason ordered out the Michigan troops, and at their head marched to Toledo, and took possession of the town. * The Ohio troops were not to be seen, although it is claimed that they had entered the town in the night time, escorting the judges who organized the court, and then immediately departed, the clerk of the court carrying away the record of the proceedings had, in his hat. Both parties soon withdrew and the troops were disbanded; and from this time on the people of the disputed district regulated things in their own fashion. It was the intention of the boundary commissioners to finish marking the boundary line, a part of which had been marked earlier in the season, under the escort of the militia sent to protect the opening of the court at Toledo. They did not'do so, however, but waited until November, when the line was run without molestation. Thus somewhat ingloriously ended the "Toledo war," quoting from Judge Campbell: "It is not unpleasant to remember, that the only lives lost were those of two horses, one on either side, one-according to tradition-an Ohio steed slain by Gen. Stickney by mistake, and one lost in some unknown way, for which the state of Michigan paid Mr. Bailey," who claimed to be its owner. Mr. Stickney was also allowed $300 by the legislature of Ohio to soothe his feelings for being confined in Monroe prison, and for oiher damages claimed to have been done to his property and person. Although the "war" was ended, the controversy was simply transferred, and Congress was now the battle ground. To enter into a discussion of all the questions arising upon the proceedings in Congress, and in the state, which led up to its admission, or to enter upon a full examination of these proceedings would be foreign to the purposes of this paper. I shall content myself with such reference to them as may explain the final settlement. 29

The presidential election was at hand, and it was of the utmost importance to the party of General Jackson that the states of Ohio, Indiana and Illinois be conciliated and the differences regarding their northern boundaries be settled to their satisfaction. Actuated by this view of the situation, Congress ended the controversy by act of June 15, 1T36, which, among other things, gave to Ohio the northern boundary as claimed by that state, and after accepting the constitution of Michigan which had been adopted the previous year by the people, admitted the state with a proviso that the state should first assent by a convention of delegates elected for that purpose, to certain new boundaries proposed in the act. These new boundaries gave Indiana and Ohio all that they had claimed, and gave Michigan in lieu thereof the larger part of what is now known as the upper peninsula. Governor Mason called an extra session of the legislature, and the excitement over the question of accepting the provisions of the proviso was intense, and on the whole hostile to the action of Congress, which was looked upon as a piece of robbery. The legislature directed a convention to meet at Ann Arbor on the fourth Monday in September. This convention refused to purchase admission on the terms offered by Congress, which action very much disturbed the plans of leaders of the democratic party, and soon various anonymous and semi-official expressions came from Washington to the effect that it would be for the best interests of the state and particularly the democratic party, that a different action be had and that it be taken immediately. The interests favoring admission are very clearly expressed by Judge Oooley as follows: "The president's wishes on the subject were well known to his active partisans, who constituted a strong and growing party, and had chosen the state officers. A presidential election was pending and a very natural desire existed to participate in it. A distribution of the public lands or their proceeds was one of the issues of the day, and if it took place it would be unfortunate if Michigan should fail to receive its share. The senators and representatives chosen to seats in Congress were naturally anxious to occupy them, and politicians were equally anxious to be recognized in the distribution of federal patronage." There was an evident determination to have the state admitted, and October 29, 1836, a democratic convention of Wayne county called for another convention, and a similar expression was made by a Washtenaw convention. The governor replied that the legislature could not be again convened for want of time, and intimated that a "popular" convention might satisfy the Washington authorities. Acting on this suggestion a call was issued for a convention signed by several individual leaders of the Jackson party. In

response to this call a convention, called in ridicule the "Frost-bitten Convention," mdt at Ann Arbor, December 14, and at once assented to the proposition of Congress and forwarded the result of their deliberations to Washington. After considerable debate and much delay, Congress finally accepted the action of the "Frost-bitten Convention" as sufficient, by an act, the preamble of which recites it as a convention "elected by the people," and Michigan was formally admitted as a state with its new boundaries, January 26, 1837. Michigan throughout the controversy was the weaker party, but having on its side all the right. I cannot close my story better than to quote the words of John Quincy Adams: "Never in the course of my life have I known a controversy of which all the right was so clearly on one side, and all the power so overwhelmingly on the other; never a case where the temptation was so intense to take the strongest side, and the duty of taking the weakest so thankless." JOHN S. BARRY. BY H. H. RILEY. John Stewart Barry was born at Amherst, New Hampshire, on the 29th,day of January, A. D. 1802. Horace Greeley was born in the same township. When he was a year and a half old his father moved to Bellows Falls, Vermont, and died there, leaving John Stewart, Charles H., and Aldis Barry, his sons. Mr. Barry married Mary Kidder, who died on the 30th day of March, 1869. He studied law, and removed to Georgia in 1827 or 1828, where he practiced about two years, and finally removed to White Pigeon, Michigan. In 1831 he abandoned his profession, and went into the mercantile business with Isaac Willard, at that place. Afterwards, in 1834, upon a dissolution of the copartnership, he removed to Constantine, opened a store, and did a large business up to the time of his death.

OFFICIAL POSITIONS-MENTAL CHARACTERISTICS.

At this time Michigan was endeavoring to arise out of its territorial condition into a state. Mr. Barry went into the work with all his might, and was one of the leaders in the movement. He was elected state senator, and took his seat in 1835, and was in the sessions of 1836, 1837 and 1838, and was also a. senator in the session of 1841. He was a member of the constitutional convention of 1835, and held the office of governor of the state three 'terms, from 1842 to 1844, from 1844 to 1846, and from 1850 to 1852. It is no exaggeration to say that John S. Barry was one of the strongest men who ever resided in our state. No other man has done more in laying broad and deep the foundations of our government. No man was more competent to grapple with the questions that disturbed us when a territory and those which occupied our attention after we became a state. It was a work just adapted to his mind and he had the patient industry, and dogged resolution to probe every proposed measure to the bottom. He was very slow in coming to a conclusion, believed nothing that he could not demonstrate, and was never willing to express an opinion until every authority had been consulted and every fact examined. He was skeptical on all subjects. I have heard him say, more than once, that history was not to be trusted-it was written in the interest of some party or sect, and the only way was to read all, from all sides, and get as near the truth as possible. He was never carried away by the blandishments of men, flattery did not disturb him, and it may be remembered by some persons still living that he refused promotion to some of the most active democratic politicians who were instrumental in his election, because, as he said, they were unfit to hold office under him. The public estimation of John S. Barry as a man has always been a mistake. I know that in the discharge of his official duty he was cold and reserved, and always held himself in check, and was careful not to commit himself, until he was ready to act. He had no friends who could bring him in conflict with what he regarded his public duty. But in private, at home among his people, in his own house, no man ever lived who was more approachable, who talked more, or who was more hospitable under his own roof. I have heard him time and time again, sitting in his store, a half a dozen farmers around him, discussing, as he could discuss, some important question before Congress; some problem in European affairs or some domestic matter, political, economical or financial, and I well remember what earnestness and enthusiasm he pressed into his arguments and how thoroughly he was posted in what he said. There was no sentiment about him. He reasoned from the head, not the heart. Poetry did not trouble him4much. He wasted no thought on the fine arts. le did not know one tune from another, and said he supposed that

-what Shakespeare meant when he said that "a man who had no music in his soul, was fit for treason, stratagem and spoils," referred to the soles of his shoes, because a thief could thus move without making a noise. I desire now to go into some particulars illustrating more forcibly, per. haps, the character of the man. While in Georgia practicing law, a conflict sprang up between the state and the federal government on the Cherokee question. Mr. Barry at the time was captain of a military company, and he was called out with the other troops to uphold the*dignity of the state. A barbecue was held, an ox roasted, and among things done, the obnoxious act of Congress was burned. Mr. Barry said, in reviewing the history of this affair, many years after: "I knew, sir, that the general government was in the right, and Georgia was wrong-I knew that burning an act of Congress did not repeal the law. But what could I do, sir! I was the captain of a company and was ordered out. But I made up my mind, then and there, sir, that if it came to a fight, I would run, because, sir, Georgia was in the wrong, in the wrong, sir!" During the Black Hawk war Mr. Barry was a justice of the peace, and resided at White Pigeon. About midnight he was aroused by a neighbor of very mercurial temperament, but a man of large influence, with the cry, "'Black Hawk is upon us! Black Hawk is upon us! Get up Mr. Barry! Turn out! Arouse the neighbors! and let us defend ourselves! " Mr. Barry threw up the window, clad in his nightdress, and screamed out " Who's there? " Mr. -- replied, "It is I," and went over again the same story about Black Hawk. "Is that what all this noise is about? " exclaimed Mr. Barry. "You go home, sir-go to bed, and go to sleep. Black Hawk is this minute on the other side of the Mississippi and will never cross the river. Go home, sirl Go home. Good night, sirl" and down went the window with a slam. Mr. Barry was right. Black Hawk was at that very time on the west side of the Mississippi river. Governor Barry had a grim kind of humor, mixed with sarcasm, which he sometimes used to coimplete his purpose. In 1851, among the reports of the public institutions of the state was one in which, among other things, the agent congratulated the state upon the fact that his institution was out of debt. The governor was informed that this was not true, that there was quite a large quantity of unpaid scrip floating about against the concern, and that it might be well to look into the matter. "Send, sir," said he, "and procure for me some of this scrip," which was done. The governor, armed with quite a large quantity of the stuff, sent for the officer in charge, who met him at his room at Lansing. He said to him that



Page 230

he was rejoiced to know that the state owed nothing-that his report showed a clean record, and that as they were out of debt, he hoped he would keep out, and he then went on and talked about matters in general. The governor bade the gentleman good morning, walked with him to the door, and all of a sudden broke in upon him with "I had forgotten one thing, sir! Come back a moment; I wish to show you something. This state institution may be out of debt-you say it is," and opening his drawer, pulled out a handful of scrip and showed it to him. The joke was so good the victim himself told it afterwards, and seemed to enjoy it as much as any one. Governor Barry frequently resorted to this roundabout way to reach his end, and although it was awkward, it was effective, and often very severe. Mr. Barry knew how to keep his secrets. I once asked him, while he was governor, to meet me in my office, as I wishel to ask him a question. He came. I laid out the circumstances and reasons why I desired the information in my most happy, and as I supposed, convincing way. The governor sat quietly, his eyes fixed on the floor, listening most intently. I concluded my little speech. The governor jumped up, and pointing to a map of the United States which hung on the wall, said: "I think, sir, the finest climate in the country is along the Blue Ridge Mountains," and thereupon darted out of the office like a shot. He was a strong writer, very concise and pointed, and he could wrap up an arrow in a paragraph that hit and stung like an adder. Ile labored over that kind of work, understood the force of words, knew how to use them, and no person had any difficulty in knowing just what he meant. Ilis messages were very affirmative, nothing compromising about them; he sat down squarely on every measure proposed and enforced it with all his power. Many persons niw living remember how violently he attacked the banking corporations of the day in his first and second administrations. He never did anything for political promotion. He had too much pride' of opinion to sacrifice his convictions to personal ends. He kept his eye on the state, as a state. Whatever may have been the opinion of him politically-however much he may ':lmv differed with his opponents on many questions-his financial policy was endorsed and supported by all parties. It is not too much to say that he was the salvation of the state. He brought order out of chaos. He found the state practically bankrupt. Scrip was everywhere, and much depreciated, and credit was refused for iron to lay the road from Jackson to Marshall, until the governor gave his personal guarantee of the bonds issued for its payment. While his mind was Websterian, and while he loved to study and handle wide and sweeping questions, especially those growing out of constitutional

HIS PUBLIC WORK.

231

law, he had a capacity for detail, and was very patient in such examination. These two elements are seldom found in the same man. They seem to be hostile to each other. But I know how exacting he was in small matters and how much pains he was often at to satisfy his mind. I have known him to sit down with the statutes and re-tax costs in justice's court, to be sure they were right. We know he sold the hay in the capitol yard and put the proceeds in the treasury, and he did it from principle, too. It was just like him, to claim for the state what he would claim for himself. He believed in doing just what was right. While a director of the Michigan Southern Railroad Company, a claim was settled by another director for killing a horse on the track. I was sent down to get at the facts and found it settled, although the company was in no way in fault, and I so reported. " Why was it settled, sir? " said he. "From policy," I replied, " to keep on good terms with the man who lost his horse." "Policy, sir! policy," he exclaimed, " what has that to do with it?" "Did you ever do anything from policy, governor?" I asked. He warmed up with, "Will you be kind. edough to inform me why any man should?" Governor Barry was always at work at some public question. He followed from day to day all the great measures before Congress. No man in the state was better posted in their history and progress. No man was more decided and outspoken in regard to them. He was also well versed in European statesmanship and politics. It was always a pleasure to him to get a group of men around him in his store, and talk to them on these subjects, as he could talk, and there were not many men who could talk better. He was a lawyer by profession, and a statesman from study and practice. He was an out and out Jeffersonian democrat, and advocated a limited and rigid construction of the constitution. He believed that we were drifting away from both its letter and spirit; that we were governed too much rather than too little; that state sovereignty was being gradually usurped by the general government, and that the line of jurisdiction between the two was fast fading out; that corporations needed watching, and their-powers kept within the limits of their charters; that the government belonged to the people, and not the people to the government; and no man who had not the pleasure of meeting him socially, has any idea of his great knowledge on these questions, and his skill in pressing them home upon the listeners around him. Governor Barry was not an orator. He had none of the graces of rhetoric, nothing of the charm of delivery, which sometimes captivates an audience. He never tried to rouse the mighty multitude by clap trap, or melt the people down by pathos or sentiment. He was cold and rather awkward in his



Page 232

AS AN ORATOR-HOME LIFE.

delivery. He always brought to his hearers a mass of facts, and was always fortified with the history of his subject, and he gave his audience matter enough to think about for a month. He was once a candidate for Congress and canvassed our district. I was with him and had a good opportunity of seeing him at his best. A district was never better canvassed than this one by Governor Barry. More political history was scattered over it than was ever heard before. It required a good head to follow him in his argument, and a great many persons were unable to do that, and therefore failed to appreciate him. Once, 1 remember, he was thoroughly aroused. A political opponent frequently interrupted him; and plied him with questions, and the governor finally warmed up and grew eloquent and poured hot shot into the gentleman for half an hour, and silenced him, showing what he could do when wrought upon by the occasion. We can learn very much about a man by looking into his home life, by finding out how he is estimated among his friends and neighbors. I have already said that Gov. Barry was not justly criticised, nor his character fairly understood by those persons who only knew him in public life. At home his whole nature came out. He was under no artificial restraint, and every one of his neighbors knew just what he was. He was a merchant, did a large business for a country store, bought and sold wheat and flour in large quantities, and ran his flour down the river in arks, built for the purpose, and from thence shipped it to Buffalo or New York. He was very methodical, and he was governed by time as closely as a clock. A time to rise in the morning, a time to reach his store, to eat his meals, and a time to retire at night. He occupied his evenings in, his library. He was a good French and Spanish scholar, and somewhat versed in Latin. He was always at work investigating some question, and he loved to talk about the subject with persons who had a like interest. When he met his friends under his own roof he was very full of conversation, but never said very much on minor matters, dwelling upon leading subjects that were-occupying public attention. He had, as I have said, a grim kind of humor, and he could tell a good story, and liked to hear one. He had no patience with many of the "isms" of his day, and usually cut off any debate about them, with two or three sledge-hammer retorts, every word of which seemed to weigh a ton. He became a stockholder in the Michigan Southern Railroad Company, afterwards a director, and still later one of the three persons who constitutel the committee of management of the western division. This trust threw a heavy work upon him, and a considerable portion of his time was spent in New York and Chicago. He was always approachable by the humblest citizen and never carried

about him a consciousness of the high position he had occupied. He was active in all home affairs and very decided in his views ahout them. Lie was a lover of money, and knew how to make it. He could lose a large amount without a murmur, but never forgot the man who deliberately swindled him out of a small sum. Such was Gov. Barry at home. A few years before Governor Barry's death he had a slight apoplectic attack while on an excursion with some friends on the upper lakes. Not much was thought of it at the time, as he was not seriously affected. Some two or three years after he had another, and finally he was prostrated in his store, in January, 1870. He was taken to his house, and died on the 14th day of that month. His mind wandered most of the time, though he had rational moments, and knew that he must die. The last words I heard him say (his mind wandering) were: " Meet me at the depot, to-morrow morning. I want you to go to Coldwater, and help me transact some business." The next day he was dead. His funeral was large, and held in one of our churches, and we laid his remains away in our village cemetery, on a cold winter day, by those of his wife. He was not a professor of religion, but sometimes attended church. He left a fortune of $300,000 to $350,000 and divided it by will between Charles H. Barry, his brother, a resident of Pittstown, Rensselaer county, New York, who is still living, and he gave a life interest in the other half to the children of his deceased brother, Aldis Barry (three in number), including Charles Dudley Barry, an adopted child, equally with them. He directed that a farm should be purchased for each of his brother's children, and the fee in the land was devised to their heirs. He never had any children of his own. LetAus not forget the men who laid the foundation of our state government. A few of them still linger among us, and but a few. A new generation is upon us now, and it is well for them to know to whom they are indebted for their constitution and laws, who it was that brought us out of a territorial into a state government, who they were who built up the financial policy and the corporate bodies of the state, and I lay this poor tribute on the grave of Governor Barry, who was not least in the ranks of the early pioneers, and to whom we owe a debt of gratitude that we ought to keep fresh in our memories, and in the memory of those who may follow us in the administration of the affairs of our state. 30

SETTLEMENT IN MICHIGAN.

EDWIN HOWARD LOTHROP. BY HON. G. V. N. LOTHEOP. Edwin Howard Lothrop was born at Easton, Bristol county, Mass., in the Old Plymouth Colony, on March 22, 1806, and was the oldest son of Howard Lothrop and Sally Williams Lotbrop. He was of Pilgrim lineage, his ancestors having settled in the old colony as early as 1656, from which time the family had continuously lived there. Howard Lothrop was a farmer of intelligence and influence, a good specimen of the old New England school, and for many years one of the prominent citizens of his locality. Edwin grew up on his father's farm, and during all his earliest years, he was actively engaged in the labors of the farm. He thus acquired the tastes and practical knowledge which determined the pursuits of his maturer years. In 1824 he entered Amherst college, where he graduated in 1828. For a short time thereafter he lived in Albany, N. Y., engaged in commercial business. While there his attention was drawn to the then little known terri"tory of Michigan, but just beginning to draw to itself a part of the tide of western emigration. He resolved to go with it. He reached Detroit early in the summer of 1830. Datroit was then a frontier outpost, with only the population of a large village. The interipr of Michigan was mostly a wilderness, known only to hunters and trappers, and occupied by the scanty remnants of the Pottawattomies. But he had heard of the fertile soil and beautiful prairies of southwestern Michigan, and he was drawn thither. Procuring saddle horses, with only one companion, he set out on his journey. West of Ann Arbor there were hardly any settlements, or roads, and his way was principally by old Indian trails. Where now stands the beautiful city of Kalamazoo, if my memory serves me rightly, there was but one cabin, that of its first settler, Mr. Bronson. He then turned his steps southward to the beautiful Prairie Ronde. There he found a few settlers who had come in from Kentucky the previous year, and who had pitched their tents under the shelter of the woods along the western border of the prairie. They were a hardy frontier race, most of them loving

235

the sports of the chase and the turf. Among them was Mr. Harris)n, who afterwards attained the patriarchal age of 106 years. I have heard Mr. Lothrop say that Mr. Harrison had told him he moved into the country with a wagon drawn by several yoke of oxen. He reached St. Joseph river, where Three Rivers now stands, on Christmas day, 1829. The river was much swollen, and there being no bridges, it was necessary to ford it. To do this safely he must go beside his team. Accordingly he stripped to the skin, and thus safely led his team through the wintry and swollen stream. I woner if any one has since tried this as a recipe for longevity! The fertility and loveliness of Prairie Ronde seem to have gratified all the expectations of Mr. Lothrop, and he did not hesitate to make it his home. He selected a spot on the southern margin of the prairie, and there, in the shelter of a projecting tongue of the forest, he built a log cabin, which was his first residence. He began at once to enclose and cultivate his farm. His original farm, with some later acquisitions, made a compact body of 720 acres, I believe. The greater part of it was prairie, but its value was much enhanced by some fine timber. It was also well watered, and I doubt whether there was ever a finer or more beautiful farm in Michigan. Very soon after Mr. Lothrop settled on Prairie Ronde, the flood of emigration to Michigan swelled to very large proportions. Here his early farm training served him well. He saw at once what would be the immediate and absolute need of the new comers. They would need cows and oxen. He at once set about supplying this want. The nearest source of supply was far down in the interior of Indiana and Illinois, and for several years Mr. Lothrop was engaged in gathering up large herds of cattle and taking them to Detroit to meet the emigrants on their arrival there. I have often heard him say tlfat, at that time, the ground was open all around the old capitol building (now high school), and here, right in the heart of the present city, was his mart for his cattle. During this-time, however, he actively prosecuted the business of his farm. But Michigan was fast filling up with an intelligent and ambitious population, and aspirations to become a state began to excite the public mind. Mr. Lothrop shared this public feeling, lie was a very decided democrat, but a majority of his neighbors, and, as for that, a majority of Kalamazoo county, were whigs. But, in spite of this difference in politics, in such high esteem was Mr. Lothrop held by his neighbors and fellow citizens, that he was often called to places of public trust. He was a representative in the first legislature assembled in the state, and also a member of the house of representatives in 1836, 1837, 1842, 1843, 1844 and 1848. He was speaker pro tem. of the house in 1842 and 1843, and speaker in 1844. In 1838, I

CHARACTER--DEATH.

believe, he was president of the state board of internal improvement, then having charge of the railroad system of the state. But Mr. Lcthrop's public duties did not withdraw him from his labors on his farm. His large farm was all brought under cultivation. One of the great difficulties under which the farmers then labored in southwestern Michigan was their remoteness from market. There were no railroads. Live stock became of little value. Wheat and flour, the only marketable staples, had to be taken to Lake Michigan and thence by the lakes and the Erie canal to market. Transport was slow and the charges heavy. In this state of things Mr. Lothrop conceived the idea that wool growing on a large scale could be usefully introduced into his farming. A bale of wool would be worth many barrels of flour and there would be a great saving in transportation. Accordingly, in the summer of 1840, Mr. Lothrop, went to southwestern Ohio, where he gathered a flock of about 1,200 sheep, and brought them to his farm. A second flock was brought in in 1841. In 184:1 the clip of the first flock was sent to Bostan, being taken by wagon to the port of St. Joseph, and thence shipped east by way of the lakes. This, it is believed, was the first wool ever sent to the eastern market from western Michigan, and probably the first lot sent by an individual grower from any part of Michigan. When the Michigan state agricultural society was formed, it held its first exhibition in the city of Detroit, upon some ground then owned by the writer of this paper, on the west side of Woodward avenue, and a little north of the grand circus park. Mr. Lothrop delivered the address on this occasion. He continued to cultivate his farm personally until 1855, when his health having become somewhat impaired, he removed to the pleasant village of Three Rivers, where he spent the remainder of his days. He was soon made a justice of the peace, in which capacity he was serving at the time of his death. He possessed a mind eminently judicial, and the discharge of his duties as a magistrate was very agreeable to him. He had the unbounded confidence of the community at large, and his judicious counsels were sought by many persons, and especially by his fellow farmers. He was plain and simple in his manners, of pleasant temper, and easily approached, and his neighbors in their troubles and perplexities found in him a wise and sympathizing friend. He knew how to compose disputes before they had run into the bitterness of actual litigation. In these humble but most useful duties he spent perhaps the pleasantest days of his life. They were tranquil days, sweetened by the esteem of all around him, and by the consciousness of doing good. Death came after a short illness on February 17, 1874. He was buried, as

he wished, at Schoolcraft, on Prairie Ronde. His sudden death made a profound impression on the people of Prairie Ronde and Three Rivers, where he was so well known and so much beloved. On the occasion of his funeral the business of Three Rivers was suspended and a great concourse assembled to pay their last respects to their old neighbor and friend. Many came who had known him as a benefactor; many who had found him a sincere sympathizer and wise counselor in their troubles; and many who had known him as a just arbitrator and judge. He knew how soon we are all forgotten and how vain are all honors paid to the dead. One of his last wishes was that nothing should be spent for any stone or tablet at his grave, but that its money equivalent should be given to succor some one in need or distress. This wish, which had in view the happiness and welfare of others, was characteristic of the man. The wish was respected so far as concerned his own estate. But there were those who loved and mourned him, who were not willing that the grave of this good man should remain unmarked. Should any one wandering in the cemetery at Schoolcraft look for the graves of the pioneers of beautiful Prairie Ronde they will find a modest stone inscribed with the name of Edwin Howard Lothrop. ST. PETERSBURG, June 17, 1887. HOW LANSING BECAME THE CAPITAL. BY FRANK E. ROBSON, ESQ, OF LANSING. It is the purpose of this paper to present a sketch of the incidents connected with the permanent location of the capital of the state at Lansing, and, as a sort of preface, I invite your attention to the provision in the constitution of 1835, under which the state was admitted into the Union, relating to the seat of government. Section nine of article twelve reads as follows: " The seat of government for this state shall be at Detroit, or at such other place or places as may be prescribed by law, until the year eighteen hundred and forty seven, when it shall be permanently located by the legislature." 1 SStatutes 1838, p. 43.



Page 238
238

EFFORTS TO REMOVE-COMPROMISE.

The provision was adopted in this form only after considerable debate and parliamentary war, if it may be so called. It is evident that even at this time there was considerable jealousy in the interior villages at what was then known and still thrives under the name of the " Detroit influence; " hence an apparent determination on the part of the delegates from the interior villages to remove the seat of government from Detroit to one of the prominent interior towns; undoubtedly other influences were also at work, but the jealousy of Detroit's power seemed to be the moving cause. Ann Arbor made a strong effort for it; through its delegate, Mr. Mundy, so much of the report of the committee of the convention appointed to draft a constitution as related to the location of the seat of government, was referred to a special committee.' On May 22d, the next day after the resolution referring to a special committee passed, the president of the convention appointed.as such committee: Edward Mundy, of Washtenaw; Jonathan D. Davis, of Wayne; Samuel Colbath, of Monroe; Benjamin B. Morris, of Pontiac; Townsend E. Gidley, of Jackson; Titus B. Willard, of Berrien, and Hezekiah G. Wells, of Kalamazoo. The preponderance of opinion in the committee was against Detroit; it may bo that the Washtenaw chairman had his committee well in hand, for when the committee reported on the 16th of June, the report gave all possible advantage to Ann Arbor. Its substance was as follows: "The seat of government shall be located at Ann Arbor, in the county of Washtenaw, until 1845, in which year the legislature shall permanently locate the same." The consideration of the report was taken up late the next day. This was the signal for the "Detroit influence" to put on its armor. The report was but fairly before the house, when a Wayne delegate moved to adjourn; this was lost. Efforts then followed, on this and the next day, to strike out Ann Arbor and insert Detroit and other places, all of which proved futile. As a sort of compromise, or in order to satisfy some critic, Mr. Mundy offered as an amendment to the report a proviso to the effect that, should the supervisors or other authorities of the county refuse the use of the court house to the legislature without rent, then the seat of government was to remain in Detroit until 1840.- Whatever may have been Mr. Mundy's 'intention, the proviso proved of no avail, for the motion was lost. Various other amendments were proposed, varfing practically only in the time when the capital should be permanently located, all placing it temporarily in Detroit; the time when it should be permanently located ranging SJournal of Convention, p. 42. 2 Journal of Convention, p. 60. * Convention Journal, pp. 190, 191.

from 1839 to 1849. Finally, delegate Jno. S. Barry offered the form in which it appears in the constitution of 1835, above referred to, which was adopted. Thus for a time the question was disposed of, but, in fact, it was only a temporary suspension of hostilities, a breathing spell, preparatory for the greater conflict to follow. As the year 1847 approached the outcry against the "Detroit influence" grew louder and more pronounced, and this influence evidently did not consist solely in the legitimate influence of strong minds over the weaker. It was necessarily true that there were a greater number of able men in Detroit than in any other community in the state. The late Levi Bishop, in a paper read before one of the early pioneer meetings, mentions the other influences, some of which are not unknown to legislators of the present day. He says, "It was. said that where important measures were pending before the legislature, the influence of the social circle and of ladies' society was brought to bear upon the members, and many will remember that the influence of 'quail parties,' and 'quiet suppers' was often alluded to as the principal motive for the passage of many important. acts of legislation1." The feeling that a more "healthy political atmosphere " was necessary, increased as the season of 1847 approached, and early in the session bills were presented in both senate and house providing for the location of the seat of government, also a supplemental bill providing for the removal of the departments of the state government, and other necessary matters connected with the location of the capital. It would be tedious to give the details of the various motions, votes, references, reports and the action had upon them, hence I shall content myself with a short sketch of the progress of the house bill providing for the location, which was the one finally passed; at the same time noting only the more prominent features connected with its passage, also noticing some incidents connected with the passage of the supplemental bill. The bill providing for the location was introduced January 6, and, as usual, read twice. It was first referred to the committee of the whole and then taken from that committee and referred to a special committee. Early in February the special committee reported a bill substantially the same as that passed, except that the place of location was left blank, and it contained a proviso that the county where located should provide for the necessary buildings and give them rent free to the state. This proviso was finally stricken off. While the committee were a unit as to the proposed form of the bill and its provisions they were divided as to the proper place of location, and as a I Pioneer Collections, vol. 1, p. 611, et seq.

"A GREAT JOKE."

sort of compromise reported the bill in blank, and', upon this point presented three reports. The reports argued the necessity of removal from Detroit and seemed inclined to be in favor of Marshall, Calhoun county having presented to the legislature a proposition in substantial accord with the proviso as reported. Against the removal to Marshall it was urged that it was too far south, while the reply was that north of it was but a "howling wilderness." In one of the reports it was urged, among other things, that if the capital remained at Detroit no poor man could become governor, as the salary (then $1,500) could not support him in the gay city, while it was sufficient to enable the poor but ambitious man to live in the simplicity of the interior villages. The bill to locate ran the usual course of important measures, and was many times before the house. The name of nearly every village in the interior was presented. Among them were Lyons, Byron, Saginaw, Eaton Rapids, Jackson, Marshall, Ann Arbor, Utica, Corunna, Battle Creek, and of course Detroit was continually urged. At one time it was agreed by a vote of 30 to 28 to insert "Lyons in the county of Ionia," and a motion made ordering the bill engrossed and read a third time, but by a piece of parliamentary jugglery Lyons was stricken out and the bill was again before the house. It is probable that in this deadlock, for such it was, practically, many names were presented as a joke, for among others we find "Copper Harbor" proposed. One morning after a fall of snow, a member arose and moved to take up the bill, offering as a reason that it would undoubtedly slide easily that morning. Referring again to the paper of Mr. Bishop, he states that the proposition to fill the blank with "in the township of Lansing" was considered a great joke and received with much laughter. From other sources I learn that instead of its being a joke it was in fact a well laid scheme, brought about by a man from Kalamazoo, who had been instrumental in locating the lands of the Seymours and Townsends. He was a man who hung about the land office and had an interest in the lands located by these parties. It was through his efforts that the motion was made and passed in the house. It is undoubtedly true, however, that most of the members voted for the proposition, considering it simply in the light of a good joke to locate the capital in the woods. Immediately after the measure became somewhat assured he went to New York and urged the matter so strongly to the others interested, and placed in such glowing colors the immense fortunes to be made from their investments should the capital be located on, or adjoining their lands, that a powerful lobby was engaged to boom the proposition to locate in Lansing township. Mr. Bishop says no debate was had upon the question, but

it was put at once and carried, even members of the Wayne delegation voting for it. It was a sorry joke for them, however, as'the bill was immediately sent to the senate. All the aspiring villages now became alarmed, and many of the delegates who had voted for the measure would gladly have recalled their votes. At once a powerful lobby surrounded the senate, and every county and village desiring the capital presented propositions for its location. Land, money and buildings were offered as inducements. It is probable that "quail parties" also flourished, although I find no mention of them in the records. Every known tactic was used to have the bill amended and then returned to the house in order that it might be killed off, but all of no avail, the bill passed the senate, was presented to the governor, and, receiving his signature, became a law. The measure came from the house on February 13 and was before the senate until March 9, when it passed. Almost the entire of the 4th, 5th, 6th and 8th of March were taken up with the measure, and on the 8th the senate took fifty one votes upon the question in some form. The arguments used against its location in the township of Lansing, then truly a "howling wilderness," is quite neatly summarized by Mr. Bishop, to whom I am again indebted. "What, shall we take the capital from a large and beautiful city * * * and stick it down in the woods and mud on the banks of Grand river, amid choking miasma * * * * *, where the howl of wolves and the hissing of massaugas, and groans of bull frogs resound to the.hammer of, the woodpecker and the solitary note of the nightingale?"1 Undoubtedly this is but a fair picture of the situation as it appeared to the legislator's mind. One disgusted member offered a new section to the supplemental bill above referred to, which reads-as follows: "The sum of one hundred dollars is hereby appropriated out of the five mill tax to erect guide boards to direct the members of the next legislature to the seat of government of the state of Michigan, to be expended under the direction of the said commissioners." The bill also provided for an appropriation of ten thousand dollars with which to erect temporary buildings. This was evidently considered a piece of great extravagance by some, as a motion was made to amend the title by adding thereto, "'and to absorb the building fund in temporary buildings, thereby preparing the way for taxing the people to erect permanent state buildings."3 The supplemental act provided for three commissioners to be appointed by the governor, to select a site, giving them the privilege of locating on school SPioneer Collections, supra.

section 16, or accepting some proposition which might be offered to them, and locating on some other section in the township. The commissioners examined sections 5, '9, 10, 13,. 20, and 21, and finally selected section 16. Various propositions were made to them, those of James Seymour, to locate on section 9, now the north part of the city, and that of the' Townsends, to locate on section 21, now the south part of the city, were the most prominent. The most interesting reading is, perhaps, the proposition of Mr. H.. B. Lathrop, of Jackson. Speaking of the Townsend proposition he says, " One of the worst, in point of health, that could be adopted. You have dead water on each side of you, and agues and chill fevers would be as sure to the state officers and their assistants as would be their salaries."' Mr. Seymour's proposition was in renewal of one made to the legislature and contains one phrase of prophecy which is worth considering here. Speaking of the Grand river valley, he says, " Tt will soon become one of the richest and most populous parts of the state." The report of the committee sets out fully their reasons for choosing section 16, and they seem worth repeating now. They say we " found it, in the main, an excellent section of land, exceedingly well timbered, and its soil of a very superior quality for the purpose of cultivation. * * * * Its centre is very handsomely elevated above the river, and is nearly equidistant from the two water powers in sections 9 and 2f, at which points it is probable that extensive improvements will be made and, at no distant day, thriving villages spring up.' 3 The naming of the proposed village was the source of considerable sport in the legislature, and it was only after some contest that the name of Michigan was finally chosen. The bill, as it passed the house contained the name of "Aloda" which was changed by the senate to "Michigan." Among the names presented in the house are: Houghton, Bushridge, Harrison, Kinderhook, El Dorado, Thorbush, Huron, Marcellus, and the member who wanted sign boards erected proposed Swedenborg. In the senate the names proposed were those of eminent men of the times or of the revolution: Franklin, Washington, Lafayette, Cass, Tyler, Fulton and Wright being some of those proposed. Frequently people are born with names not exactly to their liking as they grow older, or perhaps a whim of the parent provides one wiLh a name that truly becomes burdensome to its owner. The village of "'Michigan," we may suppose, became tired of its name and wanted a new one, for early in the "I.Joint Documents, 1848. Report of commissioners.. Joint Documents, 1848.

session of 1848, the first session held at the new capital, bills were introduced in both senate and house to change the name of the village. The bills were introduced in January but it was not until April that the name was finally chosen. It would seem that so simple a matter as changing one's name ought not to cause any difficulty, but this inoffensive looking measure was the source of much trouble. The house wanted the name "Lansing," the senate wanted it "Okeema," and each amended the bill of the other to that effect. This brought conference committees who would not agree. The committees would report, be discharged and new ones appointed. Finally a committee was found which could agree and they reported the name "Algoma." This did not suit the members of the respective bodies, for we find several motions to strike out the name "Algoma" and insert others. Among these names were Glen, Lewis, Cass, Dallas, LaSalle, and Huron. One member proposed to burden the young village with the name of Pewanogawink, a name at that time belonging to a township in Genesee county. After much reporting and voting the senate finally agreed to concur in the name proposed by the house, "Lansing," and April 3, 1848, the governor approved the act. There are undoubtedly many other interesting items connected with the birth of our present city which might.be found with sufficient search among old files and by conversation with the oldest inhabitant. I trust, however, enough has been presented to interest you for a time, and perhaps awaken some sleeping recollections not recorded in official documents, but nevertheless of equal or greater interest, and of which I hope we may have the benefit. ----- BENJAMIN OLIVER WILLIAMS-THE FOUNDER OF OWOSSO. [From the Owosso Weekly Press, Mar. 30, 1887.1 B. 0. Williams is gone! How many thoughts rush through the mind with this announcement; thoughts of the time when this beautiful city of Owosso was the hunting ground of the Indian; days when the brothers A. L. and B. 0. Williams swam the waters of the Shiawassee river, bearing upon their shoulders skins of fur-bearing animals, often heavy with icicles, their only associates the rude Indians with whom they became fast friends; days when these brothers owned the entire ground on which Owosso stands-thence onward till

now Owosso beams forth a prosperous town with its 5,000 inhabitants, in the development of which he has been closely connected. What can we say of him? A man of state-wide reputation in pioneer annals; known throughout the length and breadth of Shiawassee county; kind hearted, benevolent, generous, ever ready with sympathy for the afflicted and aid for the distressed; an honest, upright, public spirited citizen; a tender and affectionate husband and father; one whose robust form was seen daily upon our streets until paralysis fastened itself upon him and withdrew him from our daily sight-this was B. 0. Williams. Alfred L. and Benjamin Oliver Williams were the first two white settlers in Shiawassee county, and their names are known, not only throughout this county, but prominently in the state pioneer history. As was said on the occasion of the death of k. L. Williams, to write the history of one of these brothers would be to give in great part (at least their early days) the life of the other also; and to give a sketch of the life of these two brothers would be to give not only a history of the founding and early days of Owosso, but would comprise also a volume of Shiawassee county pioneer history and much of the pioneer days of the state of Michigan. Enough in the way of pioneer sketches and reminiscences given by B. 0. Williams at pioneer meetings, both county and state, has been printed from time to time to make an interesting volume of pioneer history. Side by side in the large volume of Ensign's history of Shiawassee county stand the portraits of these two pioneer brothers, leading the list of biographical sketches, as the first two white settlers in Shiawassee county. Mr. Williams was born in Concord Mass., Nov. 18, 1810. In the fall of 1815, Major Oliver Williams, father of A. L. and B. 0., emigrated from Massachusetts to Detroit with his wife and nine children, and in 1819 he removed thence to Oakland county. In August, 1831, the sons, A. L. and B. 0., set out from Pontiac with two assistants and a double team loaded with goods, and passing through the intervening wilderness came to the Shiawassee river at the point where the river is now crossed by the Chicago and Grand Trunk R. R., where A. L. had entered an eighty-acre tract of government land. Here they opened a trading post and soon after built the building extensively known as the "Shiawassee Exchange," a double house one and a half stories high, used as a dwelling and a storehouse, and afterwards as a tavern. In the summer of 1833 they purchased lands at "Che-bocwating" or the "Big Rapids" of the Shiawassee (Owosso), which was the first purchase of lands in the north half of the county. In the spring of 1837 the brothers located permanently on their Owosso lands, where they at once commenced extending and adding to the improvements which had been begun under their direction

in the fall of 1835. In this removal from their old trading post above, on the Shiawassee, they retained the "Shiawassee Exchange" property, which they sold the next year to the -American Fur Company. Henceforth their home and their interests were in Owosso, a spot whose lovely location charmed them at first sight. When the California gold excitement broke out the brothers went to the gold fields, remained two years, opening the first hill digging in California, returned to Michigan and again made the journey to California; leaving their interests there in charge of their brothers, Alpheus F. and James M. Williams, they returned to Owosso. The close affection and business trust between the two brothers through long years, having as it was expressed, "but one pocketbook between them" was touchingly beautiful. B. 0. Williams was very friendly and familiar with the Indians and learned to speak their language, which he never forgot in later years. In the spring of 1835 he, in company with his elder brother, Gardner D. Williams, of Saginaw, -went to Washington in charge of a party of thirteen Saginaw Chippewa chiefs for the purpose of concluding a treaty by which the Indians should sell to the United States the tribal reservation granted them by the treaty of Saginaw in 1819. This negotiation was ultimately successful. The deputation remained about three weeks in Washington, and the whole journey consumed about two months; the means of traveling at that time being by stage and canal. In 1838 Mr. Williams was married to Miss Sophia A. Smith, of Canandaigua, N. Y., a lady of lovely character, who endured the privations of a pioneer life with cheerfulness, and who has since borne the luxuries of a succeeding life of wealth and refinement with modesty and unostentation. Their first dwelling was on a now vacant lot on Oliver street, between the A. L. Williams and the Judge Gould places. A contract for grubbing and clearing about forty miles of the line of the old "CNorthern Railroad" (from the center of Shiawassee county westward to Lyons, Ionia county) was taken by the brothers A. L. and B. 0., at $248.50 per mile, and one half of the distance was sub-let by them to Messrs. Kipp & Moore, of Ionia. The work was commenced in November, 1838, and was completed in the summer of 1839, but resulted in loss to the contractors. In 1839 B. 0., in company with Daniel Ball, took the contract to grade ten miles of the same road, eastward from Lyons, but only a part of this work was completed before the definite failure and abandonment of the project by the state. When A. L. & B. 0. resolved to try the experiment of mining on the Pacific slope, in 1850, they migrated thither, took up a claim in Nevada

county, which they named Pontiac Hill, and commenced operations. These were the first hill diggings opened in California. The history of Nevada county gives to them the credit of finishing the first water race for gold washing in the county. It ran from Nevada to Rough and Ready. Gold was found within thirty feet of where they commenced work, and ten feet below the surface they took out a ten quart pan of earth which yielded 126, pennyweights of gold. They remained at this place for two years, then sold their claim and returned to Owosso. In May, 1852, they again went to California-sending a party of men with horses by the overland route-and purchased a water right in Sierra county which they worked successfully, and on which over half a million dollars have been expended; as has been stated, they left their interests there in charge of two brothers and returned to Michigan. In 1863-4, B. 0. accompanied Col. Hayden, of Ohio, on a tour for the discovery and working of gold and silver mines in Honduras, Central America.. They made a very thorough exploration of that region, but no extensive operations resulted from the discoveries made. B. 0. Williams was always a staunch democrat, and, until bodily infirmities compelled him to decline, scarcely ever was a democratic state convention held without " B. 0." as a delegate. From the casting of his first vote,. in 1832, till his death he remained true to the democratic party. He was not ambitious for political honors; had he been aspiring he would have been foremost among those in political prominence in the state. At one time his name was mentioned as democratic candidate for governor, but he would not permit it. He was the third mayor of Owosso, has served as supervisor, and in various positions of trust and honor. He took great interest in our public7 schools and was a member of the school board for several years. Mr. Williams was a firm supporter of the Episcopal church,- a vestryman for several years, and at the time of his death an honorary member of the vestry. The Williams brothers gave Fayette Square to the city; to the Episcopal. church the ground on which the church edifice stands; and to the Ladies' Library Association a lot for a building. March 22, 1887, Mr. Williams passed out from these familiar scenes forever, leaving the faithful wife of his pioneer days and later enjoyment, and three sons, James A. and Charles S., of this city, and B. 0., who is living at Denver, Col. A daughter, Mary, first wife of Hon. WVm. Kilpatrick, died in 1869. Notwithstanding a severe storm on the day of the funeral the church was filled to overflowing by those who would do honor to Owosso's departed pioneer father. Many persons from other portions of the county braved the

storm to be present.- Business places were closed and the city authorities and members of the board of supervisors attended in a body. The city council at a special meeting passed memorial resolutions which will be found in the official proceedings. AUGUSTIN S. GAYLORD. BY RON. D. H. JEROME. Hon. Augustin S. Gaylord was born on the 9th day of February, A. D. 1831, at Jefferson, in the state of Ohio. He came from sturdy Puritan stock and was the oldest son of Harvey Russell and Stella Maria Gaylord. The father was born in Harpersfield, in the state of New York, and the mother in the state of Ohio. Mr. Gaylord, the subject of this sketch, was libarally educated in the best institutions of learning in Ohio, and when he reached manhood was energetic and untiring in supplementing his early advantages by choice reading and research of all that would enlarge and cultivate his mind. In addition to his labors in the solid branches of history, literature, and the sciences, he had a superb taste for, and knowledge of the fine arts, especially music, and to these he could always resort for recreation. His well stored private library was proof of an exquisite taste and of liberal accomplishments. These acquirements adapted him to mingle with the most refined associations. In his social relations he was generous, courteous, and always the intelligent gentleman. Mr. Gaylord removed from Ohio to Saginaw in the summer of i851, when he at once entered upon a course of study for his profession, as a lawyer, and as an aid to his training in this regard, in 1852 he accepted the position of deputy county clerk of Saginaw county, which appointment was made by the venerable Sanford M. Green, the then judge of the circuit. So intelligently were the duties of this position discharged that he was several times eleoted as clerk of the county during the years that followed.

OFFICIAL RECORD.

Politically he was a whig until the formation of the republican party, when he became a member of the latter. In religion he was an Episcopalian and an honored member of that church. About the year 1854 he entered upon the practice of the law and soon formed a copartnership with the Hon. John Moore, with whom he had been a student. From the beginning as a lawyer, he was a success. In acquiring his profession, the work was pursued in the broader manner. He grasped and mastered the philosophy of the science of the law, and in after life was diligent to add to it, in which effort he was rewarded by success. Mr. Gaylord was married to Emeline E. Warren on the 21st day of October, 1856, at Ripon, Wisconsin. From this union a large family of children were born, four only of whom survived infancy; two daughters, Carrie and Elizabeth; and two sons, Augustin J. and Harvey Russell. Mr. Gaylord held many official positions; was United States commissioner for the years 1864-5-6, and a member of the state legislature in 1862 -1863. In the latter position he will be remembered by his associates and his constituents as one of the leading minds in the house, and as a member of the judiciary committee rendered service characterized by care and intelligence. His integrity as a man and his learning in the law induced the Hon. Zachariah Chandler, then Secretary of the Interior, to ask President Grant to appoint Mr. Gaylord as assistant United States attorney general, and assign him to act as solicitor for that department; the appointment was made and the position was held until his death. During his incumbency of this office Mr. Gaylord wrought many important changes in the modes or methods of conducting the work in the different bureaus of this department, which are still being followed with advantage to the service. Perhaps the most marked evidence of Mr. Gaylord's broad elementary legal education was demonstrated in his report upon a case of importance argued before the Secretary of the Interior, touching the title to lands in the city'of Chicago. The property in question had become of immense value and was used for railroad depots and yards. The title depended upon the action of the United States government long anterior to the organization of a state government covering this territory together with old possessory rights that could only be determined by most exhaustive investigation and application of legal principles. The case was argued by the ablest attorneys on both sides. Mr. Gaylord sitting with Secretary Chandler as the law officer of the department to hear the argument, the decision of course turned on the legal opinion covered by his report, This report in its application of the law, and the conclusions reached, was sustained by men strong in the law, and notably * by some who had taken part in a prior argument of the same case, and whose

judgments were equal to any. This effort, supplemented by his entire professional work in behalf of the government, placed him unquestionably among the first men in the legal profession, and had he lived would have been a warrant for promotion. In 1876 he was sent from the department by President Grant as the legal member and adviser of a commission to treat with the Sioux Indians for the territory known as the Black Hills in Dakota. This mission was successful, and the writer was present when the president paid a high compliment to Mr. Gaylord for the manner in which he discharged the trust thus reposed in him. It is probable that from the exposures to which he was subjected on this journey in the west the fatal disease was contracted that terminated Mr. Gaylord's life in the following year. On June 21, 1877, Mr. Gaylord died at his home in the city of Saginaw, surrounded by a loving family, wife, two daughters and two sons. He possessed the confidence of those who knew him, and was ranked among the first men of Michigan. A HISTORY OF THE MILITARY RESERVATION AT FORT GRA- TIOT, WITH REMINISCENCES OF SOME OF THE OFFICERS STATIONED THERE. READ BEFORE THE ST. CLAIR COUNTY PIONEER SOCIETY AT ITS ANNUAL MEETING IN PORT HURON, JUNE 28, 1887, BY WILLIAM L. BANCROFT. When you requested me some days since, Mr. President, to make a few minutes' talk at this annual meeting of the County Pioneer Society on the subject of "Old Fort Gratiot," I readily consented, deeming it the duty of each member to contribute a share, however humble, in continuing and perfecting the history of our locality. I expected to limit my information, as you intimated, to a little talk which should be reminiscent in character, passing in rapid review the men and things of fifty years since, whose homes were within the old stockade, but whose social intercourse was largely with 32

AN EARLY MILITARY POST.

denizens of our then little village. A noble galaxy of men flits before me. History unrolls her scroll, and I am impelled to inquire who were the predecessors of these men, when and why was this military post founded, what has become of its old landmarks, and what can be said to transmit the memory of those men and things, who made history, to those who are coming after us? There is too much for "talk," and notwithstanding my experience that there is sometimes too little in a memoir, I shall venture to offer a formal paper for your archives. Ladies and gentlemen, Fort Gratiot is memorable as the site of one of the earliest military posts established west of Montreal, marking a reopening of that long and bloody contest between the French and English for domination on this continent. Denonville had succeeded the feeble La Barre as governor general of Canada. New Netherlands had just been restored to England and became New York, of which one Col. Thomas Dongan was appointed governor by the Duke of York, thus giving aa Irish governor to an English colony, peopled by Dutchmen, with Frenchmen and Indians for neighbors. And herein you may note, Mr. President, that the Irishman was ubiquitous two hundred years ago, as he has been since, and this one seems to have been happy, as we all know a good Irishman should be, in finding himself environed with all the conditions favorable for an early fight. The French claimed a monopoly of the rich fur trade of the great lakes, the Dutch poached on the French preserves, and Parkman relates that Dongan did his utmost to promote the interests of his Dutch traders. Denonville desired to build a fort at Niagara. Dongan warned him against it. Their correspondence is spicy, and like good diplomats each veiled his real purpose. "It's a thousand pities," writes Dongan, "that those Indians who have made such progress in the service of God should be disturbed for a little peltry." "Think you," replies Denonville, "that religion will make any progress, while your traders supply the savages in abundance with liquor which you ought to know converts them into demons and their lodges into counterparts of hell?" "Certainly," retorts Dongan, "our rum doth as little harm as your brandy, and in the opinion of christians is much more wholesome." The outcome of this epistolary fusilade was an order from Denonville to his commander at Mackinac, M. DuLhut, (after whom, by the way, the fair and flourishing "zenith city" of Minnesota took its name) to repair to the straits of Detroit and erect there a military post. All the waters between Lakes Huron and Erie were known as a single strait, although the names. of "Sainte Claire" had been given to our beautiful little lake ten years before,

ERECTION AND MAINTENANCE. 251 by La Salle. DuLhut promptly obeyed the order of his chief, which bears date June 6, 1686, and the same year, according to Parkinan, "built a stockade at the mouth of Lake Huron on the western side of the river," the exact location of Fort Gratiot. I ought to mention that the "History of St. Clair County," published in 1883 by the Western Historical Company, states that this fort was built under the orders of Count Fontenac, as governor general of Canada, seven years after-La Salle made his famous voyage in the "Griffin," schooner, which is stated to have been in 1669. This writer (page 607) must be in error, because Parkman refers to the original letter of Denonville dated in 1686; besides Frontenac had sailed for France and been superseded by Denonville in 1682, and did not return to Canada until 1689. The "Griffin" was launched in August, 1679, so could not have made its trip in 1669. This latter figure is probably a typographical error, but none the less misleading in a history which exhibits patient research and abounds in most interesting historical facts regarding not only St. Clair county but the state of Michigan. Dongan, not to be out-generaled, sent out two trading expeditions which returned successful, and the next year organized an expedition to capture Mackinac; but it was captured by DaLhut's and Durantaye's forces on Lake Huron. Fort St. Joseph, as the post on the St. Clair was named, was maintained only eight years, and Cadillac having soon after established a fort at Detroit, that point became thenceforth the principal focus of eventq affecting the march of history in Michigan and the northwest. During the last war with Great Britain'additional protection for the frontier was deemed necessary, especially against the Indians who were incited to hostility by the British; and on the 14th day of May, 1814 Major Thomas Forsyth arrived at the site of Fort St. Joseph with small detachments of the 4th infantry and territorial militia, for the purpose of establishing a military post. The work was done under Capt. Gratiot, of the U. S. engineer corps, and his name was given to the fort. Gen. John McNeil commanded there in 1816, and it was occupied until 1822, and then vacated until 1827, when Major Thompson and Capt. Beall, with detachments of the 4th artillery, were ordered there from Green Bay. The subsequent commanders, as near as I am able to ascertain them, were Major Payne, in 1834, Major Huffman, in 1837, Col. Gardner, in 1840, Col. McIntosh, in 1843, Major Ben Alvord, in 1849, and Major G. A. Rains, in 1850. On the breaking out of the rebellion the troops were ordered off, but the fort was the rendezvous for the 27th Michigan Infantry under Col. D. M. Fox. Datachments of the 17th, 43d and finally the 22d Infantry, under Capt. F. Clarke, successively occupied the fort,

and it was not finally abandoned until April 14, 1879. The buildings known to this and to two preceding generations were mostly demolished in 1882. The grounds forming the original military reservation extended from what is now known as Michigan street, in Fort Gratiot village, on the north, to Suffern street, on the south, and from the St. Clair river, on the east, to Black river on the west. An old government plat. in my possession shows it as containing all the land lying above the mouth of Black river to Michigan street, and it also included the light house reserve. The recommendation of Gen. Macomb, then commander in chief of the army, indorsed on the plat is, "that all the land unsold and unpatented be reserved for military purposes." The recommendation was concurred in' by Gen. Peter B. Porter. The fort was repaired in 1849, one Smock being the contractor, though the work was mostly done by the late Obadiah Gardner, one of the early pioneer millwrights of the county, whose son, John Gardner, still lives among us, being a respected resident, I am told, near Marysville. It is possible that the fort originally comprised small earthiworks, as "bastions " are referred to as landmarks in papers seen by some of our older citizens. A considerable portion of the reserve was owned by Andrew Westbrook, who sold it to the government for the consideration of $800, May 7, 1833. This is described as "a tract of land fronting on the river St. Clair and extending back in a line with the present Fort Gratiot to Black river, being the lower or southern moiety or half part of a tract of land which was confirmed by the board of land commissioners for said territory to Pierre Beaubien, and afterwards conveyed by said Beaubien to Charles Lamed, Esq., and by said Lamed conveyed to said Westbrook." This tract covered the northerly part of the reserve, and the plat referred to indicates that one Desnoyers owned, under one Bonhomme, a building situate to the south of the Westbrook land and west of the fort, but I have been unable to learn anything about this building. The Bonhomme land was conveyed to the United States by deed dated September 2, 1834, for the consideration of $468.50. This deed conveys the north half of a tract of land confirmed to Beaubien by act of Congress, April 17, 1828, and describes the land as "containing six arpents in front on said river St. Clair by forty arpents in depth, and being the same tract of land on which Fort Gratiot is situated." This forty. arpents, it appears from the plat I have referred to, also extended to Black river, covering about forty acres, and inasmuch as Beaubien conveyed the north half only of his claim,,it seems safe to infer that the south line of the part he did convey, formed also the south line of the reserve, though the lines indicating his claim on the plat are neither parallel with Michigan

SALE OF THE RESERVATION. 253 street nor at right angles with the St. Clair river. I have been unable to find a conveyance of any other tracts to the government. Gen. John McNeil, from whom the "McNeil tract" takes its name, and of which the village of Fort Gratiot once formed a part, made several visits to Port Huron after I became a resident. He was a very large man and then of venerable appearance, and lame from a wound received at Lundy's Lane, in the war of 1812, in which he bore a very gallant part. The tract comprised about 1,200 acres, the larger portion of which he purchased from one Antoine Laselle, June 5, 1826, for the consideration of $1,500. The original plat of the village has disappeared from the county records, worn outt, I presume from the appearance of many of those left, from continued use. In 1853 William L. Bancroft and I. D. Carleton made a survey of the lands included in the stockade, the gardens and the parade ground, and Mr. Bancroft made the first application through General Hestor L. Stevens, then a member of the U. S. House of Representatives, for a sale of the balance of the reserve. Nothing practical was reached and the reserve remained intact until about the year 1855, when there was an order made on the application of Martin S. Gillett and others granting to the village of Port Huron a portion for a burying ground known as Pine Grove cemetery, which was enlarged June 20, 1860, by an act of Congress granting thirty acres for that purpose. The Chicago, Detroit & Canada Grand Trunk Junction Railway Company entered on possession of a portion of the reserve under a permit of the Secretary of War in 1857, and on February 8, 1859, an act of Congress was approved granting to any company that might construct a railroad from Detroit to or near Port Huron, the right of way and privilege of erecting depot buildings and workshops on the reserve, conditioned among other things that the buildings should be of wood. This act was amended February 25, 1867, requiring that the buildings should be either wood or fire proof, and it is worth noting that the railway company had already erected its passenger depot, which is not of wood nor yet fire proof. In 1868 Gen. Wm. Hartsuff prepared a bill authorizing the sale of so much of the reserve as lies south of a line extended from the south end of the Grand Trunk railway wharf on the St. Clair river to a point of intersection with the Lexington road, and all that portion lying east of that road; and so much of this tract as lies east of a line extending due south from such point of intersection, was required to be platted and sold at public auction, the remainder to be sold at auction in the discretion of the Secretary of War. That bill was carried through Congress by Hon. Rowland E. Trowbridge, and the first sale occurred December 14, 1870, and the last one August 30, 1881.

254 'LOCALITIES ABOUT THE FORT. Pine Grove Park was donated by act of Congress, March 18, 1870, the sale of a part of the lighthouse reserve was authorized January 24, 1873, and the sale of Pine Grove cemetery March 3, 1873, and on March 3, 1879, the Secretary of War was authorized to sell to the Port Huron & Northwestern railway company all the remaining portion of the reserve. These lands are shown in the plat of that company's addition to the city'of Port Huron. This completes the record of the lands originally included in the reservation. The "Lexington road" referred to in the act of Congress, July 20, 1868, started from the north line of Huron avenue and ran along the line of what is now Pine Grove avenue to Kearney street, where it bore westward to Washington avenue and distant at that point about eight roads from Pine Grove avenue, thence it deflected toward the north to about the center of the block between Sedgwick and Thomas streets, nearly touching the present hose house on Stone street, thence it followed Stone street to Scott avenue, there it deflected to the eastward and touched Michigan street at the foot of what is known as Third street, directly on the spot now occupied by the carriage and wagon shop of James Brown, in Fort Gratiot village. Third street is of more modern origin, and the road continued on easterly to the corner of what is now First street, where stood a little church, afterwards converted into a store and occupied for many years by Raymond J. Wright, a son of William Wright, one of the oldest and worthiest of the early pioneers of St. Olair county. When I first saw the reserve, in 1844, the stockade stood east of St. Clair street and near the north line of Scott avenue. A road led southwesterly from the fort enclosures Lo a point on Black river near the west end of Lyon street. The garrison gardens lay between the stockade and the Lexington road, extending to the south line of the parade grounds, which covered all the space to the river bank east of the gardens and south of the stockade to a line running west from W. N. Botsford's elevator. There was also at the end of the Black river road and on its banks a clearing of several acres, which had been leased several years to Amzi Botsford, a brother of John S. Botsford, who, with his estimable lady, continue with us, venerable and highly esteemed citizens. Other than this the reserve was open woods or dense bush. A road ran near the river bank between the fort and the town, which washed away in patches where the swift current of the St. Olair and the consuming swells from old Lake Huron combined forces for its 6rosion, and again it wound among drooping shades and pleasant nooks. It was never decided, I believe, whether'this road or that leading from the fort to Black river was the true "Lover's Lane," which every enlightened community is expected to offer to the young and enterprising of both sexes, I can

only testify in behalf of the St. Clair road, that many a time and oft, before narrow buggy boxes were invented to squeeze young couples together, willynilly, I have in one of the old time vehicles snuggled close to my "best girl," where now flows from ten to forty feet of water, and esteemed it the pleasantest road that ever led to Cupid's charmed bowersl I think the first onslaught on the timber was made in 1870, when Daniel B. Harrington opened up Pine Grove avenue, or what is known in the acts of Congress as "Harrington avenue," a name which it seems to me it might appropriately bear to-day, as we have a fill of the "Pine Grove" nomenclature, and Mr. Harrington was one of the founders and large proprietors of our beautiful city. The fort cemetery was located in a delightful grove a few hundred feet southeasterly from the elevator 'site, and in the northeast corner of Pine Grove park. It was abandoned in 1884, and its mouldering tenantry removed to Lakeside. Pine Grove cemetery has undergone the same transition, and already over the remnant dust of its thousand dead the fleeting drama of life goes briskly on. In an angle to the northward from the fort cemetery and west of the elevator stood a large, square, two storied, porch fronted frame dwelling of considerable pretentions to achitecture for the times, of which we shall have to take fuller note presently. To the west of the Lexington road and perhaps eighty rods from it, and I should think near the fifth ward schoolhouse, stood an humble dwelling, the home of the mother of James A. Clancy, erroneously put as James Ward in our county "Hist ory." Clancy is, as he has been for many years, a trusty mail agent on th e Grand Trunk railway between this city and Detroit and I shall have occasion to refer to him again. Not far from Mrs. Ward lived a Mr. Hazlewood, now and for many years past a faithful and respected employ6 of the Grand Trunk. These were the only tenements tolerated on the reserve, and finish its original picture as presented in my mind's eye. The personnel of the story which remains to be told may be more interesting. All of the officers whom it was my good fortune to know, were worthy gentlemen, and a visit with many of the fort families was for a young man at once a delight and instruction. Col. McIntosh was a sturdy Scotchman, a soldier as rigid in discipline as he was brave in the field. He was bayoneted through the face in thd battle of Palo Alto, and wounded again the next day at Resaca de la Palma, in Mexico, and returned to Fort Gratiot during the period of his convalescence; that accomplished he returned to the war and was wounded again at the taking of Mexico and died in that city in 1847.



Page 256
256 PERSONNEL. Major Alvord's name became the synonym for official promptness and integrity and he was for many years the paymaster general of the army, and held that office until his death, which I think occurred only last year. Mrs. Alvord was a lady of fine personal appearance, supplemented by the most kindly manners and lovely disposition. They took a lively interest in village matters. The major was one of the organizers of the first lyceum in Port Huron, attended regularly its meetings,with Mrs. Alvord, invariably walking from the fort to the Methodist church, near the corner of Water and Sixth streets; and they also contributed liberally towards the lyceum library, which was established and flourished during several years. May the flowers bloom brightly above both their honored graves! Lieut. Montgomery covered himself with glory in several battles of the Mexican war, as did also Lieut. Russell. Both were tall, fine looking gentlemen. Montgomery married a daughter of Gen. Northrup, an early settler, identified with both the political and religious interests of the county, and for several years its treasurer. Russell was treacherously slain with poisoned arrows by the Indians, in California, March 24, 1853, and Montgomery died in Oregon, November 22, 1854. Lieut. Staughter was of puny appearance, but gentlemanly and brave hearted, and was shot by the Indians while in discharge of his duties in Washington territory, Dec. 4, 1855. Lieutenant Lugenbeel, who was stationed at Fort Gratiot about the date of my arrival here, reached the rank of major general for meritorious services. He married a daughter of James Williams, formerly a well known citizen of Detroit, where I believe she is still living. Major Rains, I have heard, became General Rains, of the Confederate army. His quarters at the fort were the favorite resort of the young people, and for that matter of the older ones too, on all holidays, when his elegant lady dispensed prodigal hospitalities. Their popularity was great, and they left with the best wishes of our community showered upon them. Of their whereabouts since the war I have heard nothing. But I have for them only pleasant memories. Lieut. Drum was another of the officers whose home for a season was at the fort. I am told he is the same officer, now adjutant general of the army, whom you will all recognize from his too zealous care for confederate flags. Dr. Charles W. Keeney was surgeon at the fort in 1844, and until succeeded by Dr. Tripler, who was here with Maj. Rains and became surgeon general of the army. Both practiced in the village, and both were popular with our people. Dr. Keeney was a native of Detroit, and Dr. Tripler married a Detroit lady, one of the daughters of Judge John W. Strong, all of the judge's daughters being noted for their beauty.,

During the intervals when the fort was vacated by the troops it was left in charge of a post sergeant. The first of these whom I knew was John T. Townsend, a native of Duchess county, New York, and a soldier who had then served through several enlistments. He left the service about the year 1855, and removed to Clyde, where he lived many years, a thrifty farmer and neighbor to our well known citizens, Michael Plant and Edward Vincent. He died October 18, 1883. Mr. Townsend was an upright, exemplary citizen and good man, and he merits honorable mention in the records of this society. He left two sons and one daughter, all now residents of the county. Sergeant Townsend was succeeded by Mrs. Jane Montgomery, the widow of Lieut. Montgomery, of whom I have just made mention. Mrs. Montgomery left for Washington about 1858, and has since been employed in the war department. Her successor was Thomas H. Hunt, later a captain in the Seventh. Michigan Infantry, where he served bravely and faithfully. He was well known to all our citizens of those days, and is now a resident of Alpena. I think the last of the fort keepers Were Samuel Edison and Henry Hartsuff, the latter of whom died in --, and the former is still with us, a hale old gentleman of over eighty years, with whom we are all happy to exchange daily greetings. With Major Hoffman's command came a worthy soldier and citizen now among the most venerable of the little band of remaining pioneers; Charles Flugal, who enlisted in the 13th Infantry in 1813, and was a drummer boy in several of the engagements with the British on the Niagara frontier, and re-enlisted again in 1818, finally left the service in 1837, and settled in Port Huron, where he resides on Pine street with his wife, to whom he was married in 1822. I saw them both a few days since:, Mrs. Flugal a sufferer with rheumatism, but Mr. Flugal as erect as when he beat the drum for the deadly charge at Niagara. They bid fair to remain with us until their pretty great-granddaughter, whom they proudly showed me, blooms into womanhood. The sutlers were important adjuncts of the fort, of whom I am enabled to recall Messrs. F. Cicotte, A. Norton, jr., and Geo. Watson, of Detroit, and Willard Orvis and Chas. Bancroft, of Port Huron.' Mr. Orvis married a sister of the late Col. Wellington Davis, and I believe she is now living in Little Rock, Arkansas. Charles Bancroft was for several years a merchant here. During his sutlership the store was burned and rebuilt. He returned to Detroit in 1852 and engaged in the transportation business, establishing the first line of propellers between Ogdensburg, N. Y., and Chicago. He died September 26, 1859. Mr. Jenkins was a conspicuous figure during his stay and left various 33

He was identified with the original canal projected to connect the waters of Lake Huron and Black river, which was once embalmed in verse and still lives in story. Together with Mr. Ayrault he built a saw mill on McNeil creek, somewhere above the McArthur House, on what is known in our county records as the "Mill Tract." He brought as his bride the daughter of a distinguished family in New York, and must needs have a finer dwelling for her than any hereabout. Accordingly the "Jenkins House" referred to was built, with lumber from the new mill, as was also the Ayrault house, now forming a principal part of the hotel standing on the corner of First and Michigan streets, in Fort Gratiot. As tradition has it, the house was the seat of profuse and gentle hospitality, the young couple having their day of flattering popularity. But the revulsion came and nothing was left of his speculative schemes but this house. It passed into the ownership of L. M. Mason, I must be allowed to s-y here one of the best and most remarkable men who ever made a home in St. Clair county and who ought to have a prominent niche to his memory in the gallery of this society. From Mr. Mason the house passed to B. C. Farrand, who resided in it several years subsequent to 1845, and was succeeded by Samuel Edison, who tells me he occupied it until 1864, and in 1865 it, was burned. In 1853 Mr. Edison built an immense tower just south of his house, which, though now a subject of tradition, was then an object of wonler. He has never told me whether he erected it witha view of shaking hands with the lightning which his son has since made talk as friend with friend, whether it was to have been surmounted by a telescope which should solve the problem of the comet's tail, or whether it was merely to facilitate occult calculations on the succeeding transit of Venus. But there it stood, towering a hundred feet, solitary as the pyramids and useless as a sphinx, until 1864, when, owing to some differences of opinion between himself and the Secretary of War, he laid the ax to its foundation, trusting to friendly winds to topple it to the ground. The tower stood, however, in spite of both Edison and the Secretary, until late in the fall of the next year, and it left a history not likely to be soon forgotten. In 1861 Thomas A. Edison was a lad engaged as a newsboy on the Grand Trunk railway between Port Huron and Detroit. The war increased his business so that he must have a helper, and he selected his only boy companion on the reserve, James A. Clancy. They lived about half a mile apart, and Thomas found communication often necessary, but sometimes difficult. The latent genius of this lad of fourteen was fired. He stretched a line of No. 10 wire on trees between the houses, a few bottles with a little blue vitriol completed his battery, a couple of cast away instruments were found and

repaired, and lot Edison had constructed a line of telegraph, making his first success in a field later emblazoned by his dazzling and immortal achievements. This line was soon after extended and (utilized to quicken the demand for newspapers by giving Clancy advance headings of the reports of battles, then feverishly looked for with every arriving train. But even youthful genius has its rivals and clogs. In this case it was the boys from town who interfered with batteries and instruments. To outwit them our young newsmen dug a hole in the ground large enough for their purpose and deep enough for them to stand upright in. This they roofed with boards and covered with earth, making connections with their wire some distance away by the aid of a piece of submarine cable of which they had become possessed. Hither were removed their batteries and a store of chemicals with which young Edison was already experimenting. All went well until the family cow unwittingly wandered upon the structure and went crashing through to the bottom of this singular laboratory. There the boys found her on their return from town, connections broken and laboratory and materials destroyed. The genius of Thomas was not equal to the task of getting her out again and outside aid had to be invoked. Mr. Edison helped them through the difficulty and hearing what was needed constructed for them a comfortable and secure room on the ground floor of his famous tower. There the boys set up their lines, renewed their battery, added to their stores, and there Thomas A. Edison continued his experiments and added to his knowledge, laying foundations for the wonderful revelations he has since given the world, so that the old tower and its improvised laboratory are as much entitled to immortal mention as are the kite and iron key of old Ben. Franklin. At this time Thomas pondered seriously on the study of medicine and actually procured and read several books on the science. But the bent of his mind took its way again. An old electro-magnetic battery was got hold of, repaired so as to be useful, and the boy's efforts in the healing art were directed to its use, and thereby he actually received many dollars. A favorite amusement, and quite a source of profit too, was to carry his little battery to promising places in the village, insert one of the wires in a glass of water, in which he placed a quarter of a dollar, to be the property of any one who would take hold of a handle with one hand and pull the quarter out with the fingers of the other, or to forfeit a quarter if he failed. The water being a good conductor, and Thomas being careful to have his little battery well charged for the occasion, he never lost. There were many other men and incidents connected with the fort well worthy of mention. I have related such only as I thought worthy of historic

mention, or as might interest some of those present, and have already extended this paper too much for your patience. I ought not, however, to close without reference to the cholera episode of 1832. Gen. Scott was then on his way to Chicago to assume personal command of the troops in the Black Hawk Indian war. Arriving at Detroit, he found the cholera raging with fearful violence, and, losing some of his men there, pushed on in the steamer Sheldon Thompson, Captain Augustus Walker, who built the first steamer, " Empire State," at St. Clair, about the year 1848, and was well known to several whom I see before me. The epidemic increased so rapidly and was so fatal that Gen. Scott felt obliged to stop just below Fort Gratiot to land the sick and bury the dead. He finally left 280 troops as a garrison at the fort. Thirty two officers and soldiers were either left here dead or died soon afterwards, all of them victims of that dreaded scourge, Asiatic cholera. The place of landing was near the present site of the city water works. A considerable point of land projected into the St. Clair there and it was known for years afterwards as "ICholera point." It disappeared years before the water works were located. The victims were buried in the old fort cemetery, and their remains removed, with the others, to Lakeside, in 1884. an appropriation having been made by Congress for that purpose, and also to defray the expense of a suitable monument to the victims of the scourge of 1832. A beautiful and appropriate structure marks their final_ resting place, the work of our worthy townsman, Philo Truesdell. The fact that I have referred to Duthan Northrup and Martin S. Gillett seems to make a few words in regard to them indispensable. They came here: nearly together, Mr. Gillett the first, in 1839. They were both conspicuous in church matters and helped to lay the foundations of Congregationalism in this part of the county. Both were fond of music, and both used to sing in the little, old, rustic, wooden church that stood on the southwest corner of Fort and Butler streets. It was the church of my fathers, and hence thither I often repaired, so that the full, resonant voices of both of them, mellowed by the sweeter tones of M rs. Gillett, Jane Montgomery, Mary Clark and Mary Boughton, as they joined in " Coronation" or "' From Greenland's Icy Mountains," seem to me at times still floating in the air. Mr. Gillett left monuments to his memory in the corner stores of the large "Merchant's Block "' and in a life of nearly thirty years spent here in usefulness and honor. He was postmaster from 1861 to 1865, and died November 7, of that year. General Northrup removed from the county about 1856 to Mentor, Ohio, where he died from the effects of a fall in 1884, having attained the age of nearly 90 years. Both of them had their faults, and weaknesses as we all have, but

KEARSLEY. 261 whenever I recall the memory of either of them, the passage occurs to me, " The memory of the just is blessed." I must close this paper with thanks to Mrs. Montgomery, Hon. E. W. Harris, J. S. Duffle, Thos. Sutherland and I. D. Carleton for assistance in regard to many facts essential to its preparation. OUR PIONEER DEBATING SOCIETY. BY HON. ENOS GOODRICH. The town, or village, of Goodrich, built up by the family whose name it bears, is situated on the banks of a beautiful stream called the Kearsley, which heads in numerous small spring branches in the hill regions of the northeastern part of Oakland county, and, winding in a northwesterly direction, crosses into Genesee county and forms a principal tributary of Flint river. Whether this beautiful stream derived its name from old Major Jonathan Kearsley, or the major from the stream, I am not prepared to say, for when I first made their acquaintance it was difficult to form an opinion which was the older of the two. And now, as the old one legged major is so well remembered by our early land hunters, thousands of whom received the "duplicates" of their homes from his sturdy hand, I trust you will indulge me in a brief anecdote, in which he was the principal figure. Old settlers will not forget the rush of immigration which took place in 1836-7, bringing to our western wilds so many thousands of denizens of the eastern states, and more than. all from the Empire state of New York, to which so many of us early pioneers are proud to look back as our fatherland. It is a well known characteristic of the Yankee to banter and beat down, and not unfrequently those men of the east would try their hand upon the old major. They thought it very strange that when he sold the choicest lands in all Michigan for ten shillings an acre he would charge them just as much for an eighty or a quarter section that cornered in a lake or was half swamp. In vain did he tell them that such was Uncle Sam's way of doing business-. their reason told them it was all wrong. One day, after having exhausted

A FOREST ASSEMBLAGE.

all other arguments with a refractory customer, he tried the argument of his heavy crutch over his antagonist's head. The refractory customer, not pleased with this method of debate, turned upon him, and, piling him upon the land office table amidst books, papers and ink stands, began to belabor him with a pair of very large sized fists. A third person stepped upon the scene of action, and attempted to restore peace, but at this critical crisis the. fourth character in the drama rushed upon the scene and exclaimed, "Let, him alone, he is doing land office business." If you will pardon this episode we will now turn from the man Kearsley to the wild stream on which was to be built the future town of Goodrich. Soon after bidding adieu to the county of Oakland the stream in its northerly course goes winding across section 22 in town 6 north, of range 8 east. At the spot where our scene is laid the east bank of the stream rises fifteen or twenty feet above its bed, while on the west is a broad flat. Along this bank was a dense body of woodland, stretching far away toward Lapeer, and thence onward toward the rising sun. On this high bank and in the midst of this dense forest it had been determined that the first edifice of the coming town should be built. Well do I remember that beautiful afternoon, late in September, 1836, when I started alone, with my ax on my shoulder, from the new family homestead on section 20, walking two miles through plains and timbered openings to the stream, which was the well marked boundary between the extensive openings on the west and the equally extensive timber on the east. Stimulated by the visions of youth and animated with the bright hopes of the future I struck boldly and alone into the woods, where solitude had brooded since the day of creation, and the way the ax resounded and the tall aspens crashed and tumbled, till long after the bright September sun went down, was a caution to the wild denizens of the forest. I turned my back upon the scene to wend my way homeward, as the rays of fading sunlight were being supplemented by the rising moon, but the scene was not long deserted. I had invaded one of the worst wolf haunts that the moon ever shone upon, or the dark woods overshadowed. Scarcely had I reached home when the doleful howlings of the discomfited wolves were wafted to my ears on the soft breezes of the evening. There was no mistaking their temper-they were mad, and during the "indignation meeting " then and there held they raked the leaves, tore the turf and made the ground tremble with their hideous and unearthly howlings. First a low, sal moan, like the voice of a child, but soon rising to a higher key, it was answered in other parts of the woods; up the stream, down the steam, and away back in the McNeil swamp, until finally these calls and answers drew them together, and when they were assembled and fairly organized for busi

ness the demonstration was truly appalling. From the low whining of the whiffet whelp to the deep bass of the grizzly old bull dog, with every mingled note between, the' woods literally trembled, and the voice of the whippoorwill was hushed amid the discordant and unearthly sounds. But the night passed and the morning came, and nature in her wild beauty was still and serene. The wolves had skulked away to their hiding places, for they are great cowards in day time. Time rolled on, and the wolf and wild deer, the bear, the wild cat and the Indians retired from the field; and, as usual, the Caucasian held the ground. "Onward, still onward," our pioneer labors advanced, and at length the day of raising came; but where were the men, and who would do the heavy lifting? was the next problem to be solved. Far and near the woods and plains were ransacked for help, and when the appointed day came it was interesting to behold the hardy pioneers, armed with axes and rifles, winding along the Indian trails or following the lead of the blazed trees and lopped bushes to the scene of action. And there was help, and help enough, for a true pioneer always responds to the call of a brother, and pioneers are all brothers. Eighteen feet north and south, and thirty feet east and west, stood the framework or body of the first edifice in the future town of Goodrich. Though primarily intended for a boarding house, it afterwards, with its long "leanto," served a variety of purposes, among which was that of a "hostelrie," a dry goods, grocery.and provision store, a postoffice, and last, but by no means least, a hall for the " Atlas Debating Society." The year 1837 brought a vast accession to the population of the new town of Atlas, among which were over thirty families of our old neighbors from the town of Clarence, in the state of New York. There were no places of public amusement then. Even the common school and house of public worship had not reached us. When the summer and autumn lad passed, and the "breaking up plow" was either frozen fast in the furrow, or laid up in winter quarters, and the work of improvement in a measure suspended, there arose among us a desire for some intellectual and social pastime, and after due consultation, it was decided to organize a "debating school," and, as it turned out, we did not lack for timber. Three miles down the Kearsley was the embryo village of Davisonville, or Atlas, as it has since been named. There was Judge Norman Davison, with his four intelligent and vigorous sons, and around them half a dozen pioneer families. \Vest and south of the stream, a stirring settlement of pioneers had sprung into existence like magic. Two and a half miles east, in stlid woods, on the farm since owned by John Brigham, was a rude log cabin in which three young men from Cayuga county, in the state of New York, were

keeping bachelors' hall. Their names were: William S. Goodrich, Michael Bower and Moses Wisner, or "Mose Wisner," as he was then uhiversally called. To the northeast, about the same distance, in another bachelors' hall, were the two stalwart Vermonters, John L. and Charles McNeil. Two miles to the southwest, in a comfortable house of tamarack logs, my brothers had their abode, where they were earnestly engaged in opening up a new farm, or rather a constellation of farms, as future homes for the Goodrich family. The household was presided over by my mother and only sister, who have long since passed away. My father was still lingering in the state of New York, where he remained to close up business both of a public and private character. The day, or rather the night, was set for our first debating school, and our rude hall was filled to overflowing. With rifles stacked in the corners or hung upon the beams, this audience of sturdy pioneers, seated on solid plank benches, before a blazing fire in the broad, old fashioned fireplace, proceeded, in due form to elect officers and form a constitution and by-laws. All were intent on the business. Most were participants, and all were earnest listeners, and there was scarcely a speech but brought forth some bright and original idea, which, though dressed in ever so rude and uncouth language, was not sneered at, but was, in the final summing up, given its proper weigLt. " As iron sharpeneth iron, so the countenance of a man sharpeneth that of his friend," saith the Bible, and in like manner does the genius of a man sharpen that with which it comes in contact, and, in that crude sylvan hall, the human mind was as free and active, as vigorous and unchained as in the more gorgeous and ostentatious halls of modern days. There was " Mose Wisner," the embryo governor of Michigan, fresh from his ample library of books, which he had brought from old Cayuga, and the books were well studied, for " Mose" was a most indefatigable student. There, alone in his cabin, he would sit by the hour, in a grotesque arm chair formed of crooked sticks and mossy limbs, studying his lesson, and writing out his "brief " for the debate. It is doubtful if, jn after life, he ever took more pains in preparing a case for the supreme court than he was then wont to take in preparing for the weekly debate. As his cabin mate, Bower, expressed it, "he was always armed to the teeth." Pitted against him was generally my brother, Aaron Goodrich. He never seemed to take any pains in preparation, but on hearing the argument his rapid thought was never at a loss in preparing a ready answer. He was then, as now, a rapid and original thinker. Sarcasm was always his strong hold, and, when he had discovered the weak points in his adversary's argument, his misiles would strike like flashes of lightning, apd, under his telling assaults, the carefully prepared arguments of the future

governor were knocked into a cocked hat. The result was that in nine cases out of ten the Honorable Mr. Wisner came out second best. It was this peculiar trait in my brother's style of logic that in after years enabled him to vanquish the illustrious Isham G. Harris, of Tennessee, in a contest for the office of presidential elector, and to cast his electoral vote for "Old Rough and Ready," in the contest of '48. Bat other men of strong mind and ready thought were not wanting. There was Judge Norman Davison, with his masculine intellect of the older school. He was first, or one of the first county judges of Lapeer county. There, too, was his son, Paul G., with an intellect and iron will not inferior to his father, and there, too, was a second son, Oliver P. Davison, afterwards a member of the legislature from Oakland in 1847, and one of our " Macedonian Phalanx" when we moved the capital from the city of Detroit to the woods of Ingham. There, too, was the Hon. John L. McNeil, after wards an honored member of the house from Genesee, in 1849, being the second session held' in the new capital. There, too, was John S. Goodrich, my lamented brother, who was afterwards the law partner of Col. Hanscom, and Col. Broadhead's instructor, and was elected circuit judge in 1851, under Michigan's second constitution, which constituted the circuit judges the supreme court of the state. There, too, was my other brother, Reuben, senator from Genesee in 1855-56, and member of the house in 1857-8; and there, too, was your bIumble reader, whose lot it was to represent Genesee county in the house of '47, and toil in the memorable struggle for the removal of the capital, and finally, in the last democratic legislature that ever sat in Michigan's capital, it was his honored lot to serve that noble county in the senate of 1853. Others there were who then or afterwards held honored and useful minor offices in our rising community, and with this corps of debaters, is it any wonder that when organized and in full blast, the howling of the wolves in the surrounding forest. was unheard or unheeded? Brother pioneers, since those entertaining and eventful nights near half a century has rolled away. Broad fields, fertile farms and comfortable mansions now occupy the ground where then. the wolf and the wild deer trod. The wolf, the wild deer and the Indian have long since passed away. The Neshinguak trail, which was the great thoroughfare of the Indian between Detroit and Saginaw., has been turned under by the ruthless plowshare of the white man. I have not time to tell you of the strides to empire that have been made by my own adopted state. Bat while all this has been going on I too have changed. I was then in- the prime of life and youth and hope. The labors, the vicissitudes and privations of half a century are written indelibly in my countenance, upon my frame, and in my whitened locks.

THEN AND NOW.

Like the Indian chief Shanandoah, well may I exclaim, "I am an aged Hem" lock, I am dead at the top." But I desire to assure you-and especially would I be pleased to assure the youth of our land-that throughout my long and arduous life, and to this day, the teachings of that primitive debating school have not been forgotten. With my limited opportunities of early education it was one of the best schools I ever attended, and hesitate not to say that its teachings did much to qualify me for that other more advanced school, the legislature of our state. But where now is the debating school of former days? and what has consigned this most useful and interesting institution to "the tomb of the Capaulets"? A little reflection will suggest the answer. Then we had no other places of amusement, nothing to direct our attention or prevent us from collecting our thoughts and concentrating them upon the subject. Now it seems as if the world around us lived only for amusement, and some of the amusements of the day are of the most frivolous character. Michigan boasts loudly of her school system, and her wonderful enlightenment, but I ask you, my pioneer friends, can you tell me to-day which are our greatest educators, our schools and colleges, or our saloons, our base ball fields and our skating rinks? And how can you expect to get up and maintain an interest in an intellectual debate while the giddy world has so many objects of attraction? Even the religion of our one God is frittered into fragments. With a Presbyterian church on the hill and a Congregational church in the valley, a Free Will B tptist church here and a, Ulose Communion Baptist church there, a C Itholic church up town and a Universalist. church down town, a Methodist Episcopal church on this corner, a Protestant Methodist church on that corner and a Free Methodist church somewhere out in the bushes; with a skating rink opposite one church, a saloon opposite the next, a sewing circle up town and a prayer circle down town, who has time to think about a debating school? Like you and me, brother pioneer, the debating school is a relic of the past, it belongs to a former epoch. Debating is rapidly becoming, if not already, a lost art. With all our boasted education good public speaking in our sttte and national councils is less common now than in former years, and in our courts it is becoming lost in technicalities and quibbles, and the lawyer who can best abuse a witness is the champion at the bar. But to glance once more at our Atlas debating school-where now are the speakers anwl the listeners of that dim, distant, ani primitive past? Probably nine tenths of all that composed our ass3mblages are resting "beneatsi the clods of the valley." The restless, the ambitious, the indefatigable Moses Wisner, having by his persevering efforts become one of the

first real estate lawyers in the state, and a wily and successful politician was, in 1858, elected governor, just in time to retire from office when the war clouds of rebellion threatened to engulf the ccuntry in our gigantic civil war. Exchanging the pursuits of the civilian and the statesman for a soldier life, he raised a regiment and moved to the front, but death from disease soon ended hlis earthly existence, and his honored dust reposes in a Pontiac cemetery, near his old home. Judge Norman Davison, who first saw the light of day in the valley of the Susquehanna on the 11th day of-August, 1786, and who came from the Genesee Valley of the Empire state to the wilds of Michigan, in the mouth of June, 1831, was, the first settler in the woods between Grand Blanc and the St. Clair river, was one of the framers of our first state constitution, and under its provisions became one of our first judges, died at Davisonville in the town of Atlas, and county of Genesee, on the 26th day of March, 1841. His dust reposes on the site of his sylvan home. The soil of Michigan holds no more honest heart than his, nor any more indefatigably determined in the cause he considered right. Paul G. Davison, the judge's oldest son, who was born in Monroe county, New York, on the 13th day of April, 1803, and partook the noble traits of his father's character, was a strong hand in all the labors of pioneer life, and did much in shaping the destinies of our early settlements. Among other' important offices he held was that of county commissioner of Lapeer county, the duties of which he discharged with credit and honor. When I had the honor to be first elected to the legislature Paul G. Davison was my competitor, and in him I found a "foeman worthy of my steel;" and had he been the successful candidate I take pleasure in recording the fact, that the interests of the state would not have suffered in his hands. He died in Calif6rnia on the 28th of November, 1851, and as the setting sun sinks in the broad waters of the Pacific it looks out upon tte grave of one of the noblest of Michigan's pioneers. Oliver P. Davison, who was born at Parma, New York, on the 31st of ' August, 1810, was also one of the pillars of that united family in developing Michigan's northern wilds. It was he who gave the name of Atlas to his adopted town'ship when it was organized in April, 1836. Having subsequently remove1 to Highland, in Oakland county, he was elected to the legislature of 1847, and, as before stated, was one of my co-laborers ia removing the capital from Detroit to Lansing. Afcer having honored many minor offices he died at Milford, in the county of Oakland, on the 6th of March. 1879. Dewitt Clinton Davison lived and died a farmer of Atlasy and is the only son whose dust reposes beside that of his father, the judge.

THE DEBATERS-SUBSEQUENT CAREERS.

Benjamin Franklin Davison, the youngest and only surviving son of the original Davison family, still lives upon his farm in Highland, and as his age is now sixty six years it cannot be long till the last member of that pioneer family will have passed away. John L. McNeil, with his strong Green Mountain constitution, still maintains a healthy existence, and is just ready to tally seventy four. He has served with equal credit in the legislature of Michigan and the many minor offices he has held, but his greater honor arises from the fact that he is "An honest man, the noblest work of God." Charles McNeil, after having diversified his pioneer life in Michigan with an episode to Lake Champlain, boating, and another to California, mining, is now calmly, serenely and independently settled,beside his brother on the old pioneer home in Atlas, at the age of seventy two. Michael Bower and William S. Goodrich, G-Jv. Wisner's companions of the log cabin, returned to their old home in Cayuga county, New York, many years ago and were long since lost sight of by 'their Michigan friends. Roswel Preston, who was a diligent and active participant in all our debates, still lives in competence on the same farm he has occupied for the last fifty years, and if careful precision and scrupulous regard to health does its work as well in the future as in the past, he is likely to be there fifty years to come. Of the rank and file of our interested audiences want of memory and space would debar me from speaking further. Of the different members of my own father's family, the truth of history compels me to speak, though modesty might otherwise forbid it. Moses, our oldest brother, who, like Moses of old was "slow of speech," though always sound and deliberate of thought, was an earnest and consistent devotee of the pursuits of the farm, and I candidly believe he has performed more hours' labor in his lifetime than any other man in Michigan. Now in his eighty fifth year, he is enjoying the fruits of his industrious life, on the same farm he has occupied since the spring of 1836. Aaron, the next brother, whose age will reach eighty in July, is living in quiet and secluded retirement in the city of St. Paul. Among the incidents of his eventful life I can only allude to his law practice and legislative services in Tennessee, his office of presidential elector of that state in 1848, his official services as chief justice of Minnesota, and his eigaht years' diplomatic service in Europe.* *NoTE--\Vhile this address was being read before the Pioneer society of Michigan in the city of Lansing by Hon. Enos Goodrich, it transpired that his brother here spoken of was prostrated upon his dying bed in the city of St. Paul, Minnesota, and that on



Page 269
THE GOODRICH BROTHERS. 269 Levi, the next brother in order of age, died many years ago, as he had lived, upon the 'farm, beyond which his ambition never lured him, as his health was always poor; And I, who now stand before you, am next in age. I am almost four years beyond my "three score and ten," and if hard labor of body and mind would have made me either rich or illustrious I should have got there before today, but we are told that "the race is not to the swift, nor the battle to the strong, nor yet riches to the man of understanding, but time and chance happeneth to all men." As I have been too busy and too independent minded to seek for office, and the office has been too modest to "seek the man" I have generally pursued the walks of private life. My service in the house of representatives of 1847 and in the senate of 1853 have been exceptions to the rule, and in my limited public service there is no act of my life in which I can take more just pride than in the part I took in removing the capital from the city of Detroit to the wilds of Ingham county. John, the next brother, was called from his earthly existence in tho prime of life. The sun of his existence was full orbed at its setting, "like the suns of the Morea." His history may be thus briefly written: He was in boyhood a farmer, in youth a mathematiciau, in manhood a student and practitioner of law, and at his death a judge. He died at the Michigan Exchange in Detroit on the 15th of October, 1851, at the age of thirty six years, and the Detroit bar, assembled for the occasion, paid a glowing tribute to his memory. Amidst the graves of parents, kindred and early friends, his dust reposes on the flowery banks of Kearsley's winding stream. Reuben is the last and youngest of the brotherhood of our father's six sons, who fifty one years ago struck for homes and fortunes in the wilds of northern Michigan. The fact that four of us are still living is pretty good. evidence that it is not easy. to kill a man with hard work, who has plenty of grit. In business, now as heretofore, he is the busiest of all busy mortals. Though the baby of the family, sixty eight winters begin to whiten his locks, though they have not yet destroyed his relish for active employment. He has mixed with his labors a little of public life, having besides various other the 24th of the same month the Hon. Aaron Goodrich, who was Minnesota's first chief justice, Tennessee's presidential elector in 1848, and U. S. Secretary of Legation to Belgium from 1861 to 1869, was called from the scene of his earthly labors, being twelve days less than eighty years of age. On Sunday, June 26, 1887, a most imposing funeral was held in St. Paul; and the remains, having been embalmed, were conveyed to Michigan and buried in the Goodrich cemetery beside his brother, who died in 1851. There the two judges rest side by side, their requiem being the ceaseless murmurs of Kearsley's waters, and the breezes of heaven wafting odors from the surrounding grain fields and meadows of Genesee.

positions of trust and honor, been a member of both branches of the state legislature. In the legislature as well as out he was always an active worker, and to none of his public acts does he revert with more satisfaction than when in 1857-8 he labored side by side with Bush and Blair and Conger to prevent the stealing of the swamp lands from the new counties. And now, farewell to the Atlas debating school. Like most of its votaries it is a thing of the past. I hope and trust that my brother pioneers will pardon this humble effort of mine to snatch its memory from oblivion. Kearsley, the major, has long since gone to setle his accounts and balance his books before a tribunal from whose decisions there is no appeal-but Kearsley's stream in its perennial brightness flows on forever. Often in days long gone by have I strolled beside its limpid waters and thought of the words of Tom Moore, the poet, as he wandered in the dark woods of the Mohawk, nearly a hundred years ago-. " 0, I have thought, and thinking sighed, How like to thee, thou restless tide, ^ May be the lot, the life of him Who roams along thy water's brimThrough what alternate shades of woe Or flowers of joy my path may goHow many a humble, still retreat May rise to court my weary feet, While still pursuing, still unblest, I wander on, nor dare to rest; But, urgent as the doom that calls Thy water to its destined falls, I see the world's bewildering force Hurry my heart's devoted course From lapse to lapse till life be done And the last current cease to run." Yes, my pioneer friends, throughout my long life " I have felt the world's bewildering force Hurry my heart's devoted course," until to-day, as I stand before you, I am admonished that life with mie will soon be done, " And the last current cease to run." To me the wild scenery of nature has always been dear, and its commnunion has sweetened my pioneer life with all its trials and all its toils; and were it ordained that our lives might be renewed, if anything would tempt me to live my life over again it would be the pleasure of settling and improving a few more new countries. But, as said the poet Ossian, "The time of my departure is at hand, and the blast that shall scatter my leaves." At the end of my long life of toil there is a place of rest awaits me-away back near my ~.4,

SKETCHES, REMINISCENCES, AND ANECDOTES OF THE OLD MEMBERS OF THE CALHOUN AND KALAMAZOO COUNTY BARS. BY A. D. P. VAN BUREN. The period of which we write embraces most of the pioneer epoch of central Michigan. At this time, from 1836 to 1848, Judge Epaphroditus Ransom, one of the chief justices of the supreme court, was ex-officio presiding circuit judge. His circuit then "embraced nearly one fourth of the present inhabited area of the lower peninsula, commencing with Branch county at the southeast, thence north to Montcalm, and including all the territory between that line'and the eastern shore of Lake Michigan. Most of this vast tract was hardly more than an unbroken wilderness, the courts of which were held in the primitive schoolhouses and reached by the judge on horseback." There were two associate or side judges, elected in each county, who sat with the judge during the term of court in their own county seat. "- Many interesting incidents are given of Judge Ransom and his legal cortege making their accustomed journey through the woods from county seat to county seat, in rude cavalier style. The early settlers, those true founders of this state, first reared the log house, then the schoolhouse, the meeting house, and lastly the courthouse. These four, the home, the school, the church, and the court of justice, constitute the four corner stones in the fabric of our civilization. The mechanics were at first the most needful class, then came the professional men, and among them the lawyer. "I have a great reverence," says Kennedy, "for the profession of the law and its votaries; but especially for that part of the tribe which comprehends the old and thorough paced stagers of the bar." For the present these

THE OLD LAWYER-DECLINE OF ORATORY.

reminiscences will bide with the old stagers of the Calhoun and Kalamazoo county bars. Perhaps no profession abounds with so great a number of social, companiohable fellows; free lances, ready at any time to discuss, in their shrewd, quaint, off hand manner, the faults and foibles of mankind, especially of that class with whom they have been in such close intimacy. And what a fund of material for the raconteur, rich in anecdote and incident, they have gathered from their experience in "trying cases," which, as they meet in the bar room, or congregate in the courts, they weave into admirable stories. A knot of old lawyers thus assembled reminds one of a set of players in the green room, breaking their "unpremeditated jokes in the interval of business." And what a contrast between such an encounter of rival wits and the after meeting of these same rivals, in an encounter of serious and almost tragic earnestness on the boards. The old lawyer seems to resort to colloquial life for diversion, or for relaxation from the strain of hard labor. Here he finds leisure, and a tonic that invigorates him for his accustomed business routine and severe mental contests in the court room. But the old stagers are gone. Their eloquence is a thing of the past. The old forums, now occupied by their successors, no longer echo with the brilliant oratory of the old days. The decline of oratory in America is very apparent. There is scarcely a lingering trace in our courts of the forensic eloquence once so potent at the bar of Lexington in Henry Clay's best day, or at the Mississippi bar in S. S. Prentiss' day, or at the Columbia county (N. Y.) bar in Elisha Williams' time. Not that we now lack genius or talent in the profession of law, but that there is a lack of enthusiasm to kindle that genius and talont into a blaze of eloquence. Not that there is a lack of logic or learning at the bar of to-day, but that we need the intense passion to set that logic and learning on fire, before we can have genuine eloquence. Bradley, Stuart, Littlejohn, Chipman, Church, when aroused, and Van Arman at bis best, were eloquent men. They, as younger men, belonged to the epoch of oratory wo have referred to, and may be said to have been among the last orators of this period of eloquent speech. The power of public speaking is probably the most transitory of all kinds of intellectual influence, for it dies with the death of its individual auditors. The artist leaves behind him his picture, the author his book, for the world to enjoy, to profit from, and judge them by, long after they are gone. Bat the orator whose speech is never reported leaves only a recollection. No description can reproduce his eloquence, no tradition can do more than repeat the glowing story, and murmur of that wonderful power, that fascination which once drove audiences wild with delight. It is gone--vanished like & glory from the earth. Gone as completely as an ended song, a forgotten ~. '/^~ S

dream. What do the people now know of Mrs. Siddons' grace, John Kemble's dignity, Booth's pathos and passion, Henry's marvelous eloquence, or the wonderful power of the orators of forty years ago. The young generation begin to smile whbn we who have heard Bradley, Stuart, Littlejohn, Chipman, and their compeers, praise them so highly, and reply that we are overpraising past orators. And how can we prove anything? We can only say, '"It was so." The great theme, which is necessary to make the great orator, is gone, or divided up and become sectional in its application. We have no broad natianal questions as in the past, and without the great theme we cannot have the great orator. The old members of the Calhoun county bar were, intellectually, strong men and able lawyers. Among them were men who aided largely in establishing the institutions of this state. The bar, in its best days, was conspicuous for its legal talent; and for that which is the glory of any professioncharacter above reproach. Bradley, Pratt and Van Arman were self-made men. Crary, Church and Gordon had the benefit of a collegiate course, and a thorough legal training. ISAAC E. CRARY. Crary was born October 2, 1804, at Preston, New London county, Ct. He was of genuine Puritan stock of the Scotch border. He was the great, great grandson of Elder William Brewster, of the Mayflower company. His early youth was spent" on the farm. He graduated at Washington (Trinity) college, and read law with Henry W. Ellsworth; practiced two years at Hartford, Ct., and at the same time assisted Geo. D. Prentice editorially on the New England Weekly Review. He came to Marshall, Mich., in 1832, where he commenced practice. Here he was appointed general of militia; was a member of the constitutional convention of 1835 and also in 1850; the same year (1835) was elected delegate to Congress from this then territory; was representative in Congress from 1836 to 1841; was member of the state legislature and speaker of the house in 1842. He died in Marshall, May 8, 1854. Isaac E. Crary was the friend and able adviser of Rev. John D. Pierce in founding the educational system of Michigan. Dr. Horace Bushnell, in his lecture on the historical personages of Connecticut, pays a high tribute to Mr. Crary in placing his name among the eminent historical characters of tljat state, and further says, "rhe is now using that talent for which he was honored hero, in helping to form a new state in the west." Mr. Crary became law partner with Abner Pratt in Marshall. He was a well read lawyer, safe counselor, clear, logical reasoner, and known 35

more for his able mahagement of suits than for forensic eloquence. Law, education and politics found in him an able and sterling exponent. A democrat of the old school, during the first epoch of politics in Michigan, whenever he appeared at the hustings his recognized ability and umblemished character gave great weight to his speeches. He "took the stump" for Van Buren in 1840, and for Polk in 1844, and in the unwritten political history of that day are many sound, logical speeches from Isaac E Crary. 'Tis said that every man has his weakness. Achilles had his in his heel. Isaac E. Crary showed where his was when in Congress, by his persistent attack on Gen. Harrison, the President. This aroused John Quincy Adams' ire, but instead of himself punishing the "Wolverine" member for his temerity, he handed him over to Tom Corwin, who in that masterpiece of wit and ridicule, eo used up our representative that "the old man eloquent" the next day in the house, referred to the "late Gen. Crary." Crary and Corwin are both dead, but that inimitable speech of the latter will ever live in the humorous literature of this country. "Never was speech couched in droller vein." JAMES WRIGHT GORDON. James Wright Gordon was born at Plainwell, Conn., in 1809. He earned his B. A. in 1829, and his M. A. in 1830, at Trinity College, New York; was professor in Geneva College, New York, where he studied law and was admitted to the bar. He settled in Marshall in 1835 and soon attained a deservedly high position at the bar. He was elected lieutenant governor in 1839, and by retirement of Gov. Woodbridge in 1841 became governor, and held the office during 1841-42. He died at Pernambuco, in South America, where he held the office of consul, December, 1853, agedforty four. Gordon was naturally endowed with a strong intellect and good hard sense. His attainments, untiring energy, and a character above reproach, placed him among the ablest and most influential members of the old bar. There were but few important suits during the early days of the Marshall bar in which he was not retained as counsel on one side or the other. And he was nearly as well known at the Kalamazoo bar as at home. A defect in his palate rendered his voice husky. But while one noticed this defect as he began his speech, one soon became so interested in what he said as to forget the defect and only listen to the argument of the speaker. The writer has often heard Gordon at the bar and "on the stump," and has invariably found that the charm of his reasoning made one oblivious to this'defect. It was a triumph of the reasoning powers over a poor voice. Gordon got his political education at the feet of the Gamaliel of whigism

at Ashland. The old whig party in Michigan had no abler nor bolder leader than he was. His opponents in the political field were usually the same that he had met at the forum-Bradley, Pratt, Church, Stuart, Balch, Chipman and Van Arman. He was a foeman worthy of their steel in either contest. Gordon, in 1847, was the whig candidate for Congress, against Bradley, the democratic candidate. I remember that the news of Bradley's election came to Gordon while he was addressing the jury in an important case in the old pourt house at Marshall. Every one present noticed the change wrought on his countenance as it was announced to him that "he was defeated for Congress!" Van Arman was his opponent in the case, and Gordon had been making one of his most powerful arguments against the strong points and skillful logic of his wily antagonist. He was nearly half through and seemed determined to win the suit. But no sooner had the news of his defeat reached him than his looks and manner of speaking evinced it. He continued and concluded his speech, but there was a perceptible difference between the first and the last half of that address to the jury. It was addressing a jury under great difficulty; his inspiration was gone. Gordon lost the case, and his client always maintained that if he had not been told of his defeat until after his speech he would have won the suit. Two defeats in one day, and both by democrats, nearly used him up. EDWARD BRADLEY. Edward Bradley was born in the year 1808, in East Bloomfield, Ontario county, N. Y. He spent his boyhood on the farm, where he received the benefit of a common school education. He attended the academy at Canandaigua for a short time. Here he made, for the time, rapid progress in his studies, and caught the love of study in this old seat of learning that stimulated him to higher attainments in knowledge in after years. At twentyeight he was appointed associate judge of the common pleas court of Ontario county. In 1839 he came to Michigan and began the study of law in Detroit, completing the same with Gibbs and Sanford, in Marshall. With them he began his practice. He was a member of the Michigan senate of 1842, elected to the lower house of Congress in 1847, and died in New York city, August 5, 1847, while on a tour for the benefit of his health. Edward Bradley possessed rare natural gifts, was eminently social, and had ready wit and humor. Although limited in his early education, he had, by study, made high attainments in law. Self-made men are the readiest and strongest men4 because they learn how to use their education in getting it. The value of learning is in knowing how to make the best use of it. The same is true of- the possession of genius or talent. Bradley had chosen the



Page 276
276

PERSONAL APPRARANCE AND ELOQUENCE.

profession for which his genius best fitted him, and in that profession he won the highest honors. He had a firm will, imdomitable energy, and, in every inch of his being, was a pioneer. As a speaker he was earnest, impassioned, and had the rare talent of inspiring an audience with his own enthusiasm. He had an intuitive perception of the avenues for reaching the sympathies and feelings of his hearers. Here lay the source of his great success as an orator-of his great power in swaying the multitude. In height he was about five feet, ten, well proportioned, had a fine eye, light complexion, and a curly, bushy head of brown hair. There was a modest, unstudied ease about his manner, an air of bonhomie that won his way successfully among the masses, with whom he was always a great favorite. The humorous stories and anecdotes that he told with such riant effect, not only enlivened but strengthened his speeches. He could make them most powerful agents in carrying the crowd. His face had a natural reading, or, as the deaf man said of Garrick, " his face is a language." His conclusions were so striking, his descriptions so perfect, his objects so ludicrously exposed to view, that gravity was out of the question; it was Hogarth acting and describing, not drawing his pictures. Bradley had all the elements of the orator; he was logical, argumentative, endowed with that regal faculty, the imagination, fluent speech, and, says Senator Stuart, "in wit and ridicule I never knew a man who equalled him." He was the orator of the pioneer epoch, the most eloquent one during the best days of the old democratic party in Michigan Thoroughly read as a lawyer, deeply versed in political lore, extensively acquainted with the varied topics of the day, and gifted with the power of improvisation as a public speaker, he had no equal among us in addressing a public gathering, especially a gathering of democrats. I never listened'to a man who was so perfect a master of the art of public speaking. It seemed to be a natural gift. Called out at any time, he came before the people and began his speech as readily as if his subject had been the study of a lifetime. He appeared never to want a word, or to recall one. They came as naturally as notes to a bird. He said the right thing to begin with, and every sentence he uttered seemed to come readily into its proper place, as an outgrowth from his subject, until they were all fashioned into that perfect thing of its kind, a full, rounded speech. His diction was easy, clear and sparkling as a New England trout stream. It was enlivened by wit, made keen or severe by ridicule, or widened out into broad sympathy with the masses, when, rising with the occasion, he wouid, in an eloquent appeal, carry the multitude to the highest pitch of enthusiasm. Let it be known that "Ed. Bradley" was to speak in any part of the

county, and the people turned out en masse. If the anecdotes and witty things that abounded in his speeches were gathered together they would fill a volume. We have space only for a few. Who of the old residents will ever forget his story of "the old democrat in Ontario" who once votedi the wbig ticket, and the next day goaded by his sins, bought half a dozen sperm candles, took them home "to light themn and sit up and hate himself by them." In a suit tried before Judge Ransom at Marshall, a young lady sued a bachelor for breach of promise of marriage. Bradley defended the bachelor. The nature of the suit gave him a fine field for the display of his power of wit and drollery. Senator C. E. Stuart says that Bradley's speech at this time, was equal to the celebrated case of Charles Philips in the case of Blake, vs. Wilkins. Judge Ransom laughed at his sallies of wit till his sides shook, and the whole court room was convulsed with his wonderful power of humor and ridicule. The changes he rung on "Hepsey," the young lady's name, added an indescribable mirthfulness to the speech. Bradley won the suit; and, 'twas said, mainly by the effect of his ridicule and droll humor on court and jury. This case was one in which ridicule, or humor, could be used as a legitimate weapon, and perhaps was the only effectual one for the occasion. In such a field Bradley had no rival.' There was not a member of the old bar who could so "steal away the technical heart of the stern judge, and weave seductive tales in the honest ears of sworn jurymen." In 1844 the whigs had a mass meeting at Marshall. The next week Gordon, too full of whiggery to stay at home, came to K tlamazoo and made one of his most telling speeches. In it he gave a glowi ig description of the monster mass meeting of whigs at Marshall. This aroused the jealousy of the Kalamazoo democrats, and Bradley was sent for. 116 must come and answer Gordon. He came. The meeting was held in the old court house. Gen. H. H. Comstock'presided. George Winslow sang his famous song "Old Roanoke," and Hiram Underwood, Kalamazoo's gifted singer, sang a rousing democratic ballad. As Bradley came forward he. was greeted with thundering applause. lie was never in finer spirits. As he began to speak we could see the gauda certaminis (the joy of battle) beaming from his face. Nothing could equal his speech in trenchant logic, ridicule and burlesque. It seemed that the thought most desired and the most fitting illustration came just as he wanted them. Quotations from scripture, Shakespeare, Jefferson, Tom Moore, or whatever author his memory could draw from, added strength, enlivened or gave point to his discourse. The whigs in the audience grew uneasy and alarmed as he proceeded. The shafts of logic and ridicule fl.w thick on every hand till whiggery, like a huge elephant bristling with them, staggered and fell. Gordon was answered. But the coup de

grace of his speech was his description of the great whig mass meeting at Marshall. We can only give the closing sentence: "Fellow citizens, I was there and saw the entire whig procession, and it was large! Why, counting all that were there, whigs, native Americans, old men, women and children, strangers and stragglers, I have seen funeral processions larger, but none ever so mournfull" ABNER PRATT. Abner Pratt was born in Springfield, Otsego county, N. Y., May 22, 1804; was admitted to the bar in Batavia, N. Y., and afterwards practiced at Rochester; removed to Marshall, Mich., in 1839; was member of state senate, 1844-48; associate justice of supreme court, 1850-52; circuit judge, 1852-58; chief justice, 1856; consul at Honolulu, 1858-62; member of state house of representatives, 1864. He died at Marshall, March 7, 1866. Abner Pratt held a prominent rank in the Calhoun county bar. He was a man of peculiar traits of character. His views, impulses, likes and dislikes were of the most decided kind and assumed the control of his conduct. He gave his whole energy to whatever principle or policy he espoused. This made him a, bitter opponent or an unflinching friend. He could not do things by halves. He would have been a hypocrite to himself had he held in check opinions or views when their avowal was demanded. There was no compromise in him. He always had the courage of his opinions, and gave them without stint on every occasion. He probably never uttered a doubtful sentiment in his life, or took back one he had uttered. His power over the masses was great because they saw that his whole soul was in his work. As a speaker he was argumentative, and often vehement; while his severity of expression frequently detracted from the effect of his logic. When assailed he was acute in discovering the faults of his foe, and delighted in exposing them with bitterness. This made him dreaded as an enemy. As a judge on the bench he was prompt, decided, and fond of dispatch. He cleared the calendar of the Kalamazoo court for the first time since its organization. As he knew what work was he knew how to keep those crafty disciples of Coke and Littleton at their legitimate business. His perceptions of ju8tice and equity in a given case were almost intuitive, and always very clear. It was often said that an off-hand decision of Judge Pratt was nearer right than the studied opinions of other judges. He was educated in the school where Lincoln, Douglas and Greeley graduated. Being a man of keen observation he had acquired that kind of learning that sharpens the wits. Abner Pratt had in him much that made up the character of Gen. Jackson. In temper, iron nerve, moral courage and faith in,,democracy, he and the hero of the Hermi

tage were kith and kin. A self-made man, he was unencumbered by the formalities and stiffness often engendered by the training of the schools. He was ready equipped for almost any public occasion. Sarcasm was a trusty weapon in his armory, but invective-that "javelin of rhetoric"-was his keenest lance, "and those who would know how he gave it point" should have seen him fully aroused in debate before the bar, at the hustings, or in the halls of legislation. While Pratt was examining a witness, in a trial at Marshall, Judge Milea presiding, he could get no definite answer. The question was repeated. The witness, who was a prominent member of the bar, did not remember. "Don't remember such and such facts?" "No." "Well by---- I do!" exclaimed the exasperated lawyer. Pratt hated abolitionism as John Knox did popery, and always went armed to battle it on every occasion. Nothing daunted him in this controversy. If circumstances were in his way so much the worse for circumstances. Rev. Mr. Cleaveland preached this political heresy in Marshall. Pratt was aroused, and, like "old Put," seized his gun-so to speak-and started out after this abolition "wolf." He assailed him the first chance he had in getting before the public. Cleaveland came to Battle Creek and preached the "heresy" there. The excited democrat tracked him down to that place, and in one of his bitter pro-slavery onslaughts, assailed this disturber of the public peace again. In this fight Pratt gave no quarter. At such times, like Tristam Burgess, he had no humor "but an infernal sarcasm." "Renze" Coe, of Climax, had sued Jim Pierce for sheep killed by his dog. The case was tried before Judge Pratt, without jury, at Kalamazoo. The judge objected to Coe's being sworn, as he was a party to the suit, the general law then not allowing either of the parties in a suit to testify. The plaintiff's lawyer claimed the law allowed Mr. Coe to testify. The judge said he knew of no such law. The lawyer then produced a special law that covered the case. Judge Pratt took the book, read the clause referred to, and replied: "That is the most damnable law on the statute books; it is a premium on perjury!" Then turning to Coe, he said, "You can swear if you want to, but I shall not believe a word that you say." Mr. Coe did not swear. Pratt read enough in the man's face to justify what he had said in regard to not believing him under oath. In 1848 Pratt and Hughes were at Cassopolis looking up testimony in the "Kentucky slave case." Geo. B. Turner, of Cassopolis, was assisting them. Pratt, always an inveterate joker, had at this time played several severe ones on Hughes. One day Turner espied Dr. Lamborn in the streets. Dr. Isaac Lamborn was learned and erratic, and keen in analyzing character. Politi

THE TABLES TURNED.

cally he hated Pratt, although he had never met him. Turner seeing a "good thing" ahead, invited the doctor into the office. Pratt was lying on a lounge in the back part of the room taking his ease. "Now," said Turner, "Dr. Lamborn, I would like to hear your opinion concerning three prominent democrats of Michigan. First, what do you think of Judge Ransom?" Doctor-"What do I think of Epaphroditus Ransom? I will tell thee. He is not a great man; but I think him an honest one, and a good judge. In politics he is a mere boy." "What of Judge Felch?" "Alpheus Felch has proven himself to be an excellent judge. He is a man of culture, but too honest for a politician." Turner-"Now, doctor, what, is your opinion of Abner Pratt, of Marshall?" Doctor-"Well, I will tell thee (raising his voice and accenting as only the doctor could), when Abner Pratt was born they were destitute of souls, and they gave him a gizzard." At this point Turner and Hughes became convulsed with laughter. x The doctor looked first at them, then at the stranger on the lounge, who was getting red in the face, and seemed to ask what this boisterous merriment meant. At last Turner, sobering down, said: "Dr. Lamborn, permit me to introduce you to Abner Pratt, of Marshall." Then it was the doctor's time to get red in the face. But he proved equal to the emergency. Extending his hand to the judge, he remarked: "Abner Pratt, what I said of thee I only meant politically." The judge swore some, but the stern features finally relaxed, and he acknowledged "beat." During the rest of their stay in Cassop)lis Hughes was master of the situation. This anecdote is given substantially as Geo. B. Turner gave it to the writer. THOMAS B. CHURCH. Thomas B. Church was born in Dighton, Bristol county, Mass., graduated' at Trinity college, Hartford, Conn., studied law at Marshall, Mich., with Gordon and Woodruff, 1839-41, and was licensed to practice in the Kent county circuit court, at Grand Rapids, where he early removed and where he has since lived. He was elected a representative to our state legislature in '5 L and '55. Mr. Church says: "I was not really a member'of the Calhoun county bar; while in Marshall I acted as clerk and agent principally." But, as he first located in Marshall, and as he was so well known there, we give a sketch of him here. He, as I remember him, was tall and commanding in person, evincing the man of intellect and thought. He was known as a lover of books. Iis attainments in science and literature are of a varied and extensive range. His public efforts, both at the bar and on the rostrum, have been marked by occasional exhibitions of extraordinary power, with passages of thrilling eloquence. Mr. Church has ever been a man of social and genial turn of mind,

but of a lymphatic temperament. Hence his interest has not been easily aroused, his sympathies awakened, or his enthusiasm kindled. As a natural consequence, his public efforts have been quite unequal in their effect and power. The first half of his speech may be dispassionate, or cold, logical argument, but, if his feelings then warmed to the subject, his action became impressive, his words, animated with intense thought, came with increasing force until they flowed with the resistless power of a tornado. His best efforts, as said, were born bf great occasions. He is now living at Grand Rapids, and is about retiring from active public life. The old veteran lawyer and politician, were he inclined to use the pen, could give many valuable and interesting reminiscences of his forensic and political contests during the forty five years of his professional career in Michigan. He is a fully equipped lawyer, strong both before court and jury. JOHN VAN ARMAN. John Van Arman came when a youth from the Hudson river country, near Plattsburg, N. Y., to Marshall, Michigan. He had attended, for some time, an academy in his native town. He was of a mixed German and French descent, and inherited the logic of the one nationality with the versatility and enthusiasm of the other. His command of language was copious; his delivery fluent and impassioned and often both persuasive and eloquent. His skill in the use of words was remarkable. He could "drive a substantive and six" in a style that turned rhetoric into trenchant logic. At the bar and on the rostrum he exhibited alike a wonderful power of irony and withering sarcasm. His bitterness of invective was often unsparingly used in those hand to hand fights with opposing counsel, or toward an obdurate witness at the bar, or a political opponent at the hustings. This severity of expression sometimes detracted from his public efforts. He was fully equipped for a legal or political contest. There was no weapon known in forensic strife, or in political battle, that was lacking in his "repertory of debate." Adroit, tactful, cool and self poised, a keen and skillful debater, ready for the "occasion sudden," he was sure to command the eager attention and admiration of his audience. He had almost absolute sway over a popular assembly. Van Arman seemed to possess the lawyer's art by natural instinct. He evinced that art in a masterly degree in fitting a case for trial. No one could surpass him in training witnesses for their part in the court room, or in managing them when on the witness stand. And he was equally skillful in handling witnesses on the other side. He sometimes made them more serviceable than his opponent did. He had a skill in cross-examination which -few lawyers can rival. It may be doubted whether he had an equal at 36

VAN ARMAN-HIS SKILL AS A LAWYER.

the bar in the mystery of cross-examination. It is certain that in what may, be called legal diplomacy, in all that pertains to the management of a difficult case out of court, on which success in court depends, Van Arman was at the head of his profession. The old habitues of the court room enjoyed Van Arman's conducting a trial as highly as they did a play in the theater. The examination of witnesses is usually the dullest part of the trial to the spectators. But they would "go over to the court room" to hear Van Arman in the examination of witnesses, as well as to hear him "sum up the case." He was a superb trial lawyer, as he had the love of contest in him. The most valuable attainment of a lawyer is the art of asking questions. Lincoln, like all great lawyers, asked but few questions, but they covered the whole subject under consideration. The world has had but one master of this art-Socrates-and although he has left no successor, the legal fraternity has produced the only proficients in this art, or the best we have. And among them Van Arman held a high rank. His impromptu speeches to the court, on some point of evidence, were masterpieces of their kind. And in those close encounters with his opponents he showed his rare powers as a debater. In this arena he was a dextrous Saladin, armed with keen analysis, legal acumen, and ready wit, any one of which he wielded with telling effect., We said that in "trying cases" he held the crowd like an old player. He did. For, from the time the case was called, to its close, unlike the great player who appears in but few acts of his play, Van Arman appeared in every "act" of his, and in the last scene he gave a grand summing up of the whole performance. Van Arman was not merely a lawyer. If he excelled at the bar, he was just as able and eloquent at the hustings, or on the platform discussing temperance, education, or any of the important questions of the day. He was one of the ablest democratic orators in Michigan. His address at Battle Creek to the volunteers about to go to the Mexican war under him as captain, had the bugle blast of military ardor and eloquence. By the power of his temperance, logic and oratory he twice closed up the liquor saloons in Battle Creek, and he did the same effectual work for the people of Augusta. For many years he has lived in Chicago. He has attained the foremost rank as a criminal lawyer. In the presidential election of 1856, Buchanan and Breckenridge were the democratic standard bearers, while Fremont and Dayton led the young republican party, in its first effort to win presidential honors. At a democratic mass meeting in Marshall, in the fall of '56, after Stephen A. Douglas had spoken, John Van Arman was "called out." And the democrats were proud, on an occasion that had been honored by a speech from the " little giant," to introduce their favorite orator. Van Arman was equal

288

to the occasion. He delivered a masterly speech, dealing heavy blows to the young political "upstart" that had dared "to cross swords " with a foe that had vanquished older and stronger rivals on many a battle field. It seemed that the whig element in the young republican party, inspired by the memory of 1840, had broken out into song again, for the best singers that could be found in the country were secured, a Fremont glee club was organized and sung at all their meetings during the campaign. Van Arman in his speech turned his wit and ridicule against this nondescript party that instead of arguing its cause before the people was going to sing itself into power. "Ask them," says he, "for a declaration of their principles and they will sing'The mustang colt has a killing pace, Du-da-du-da; He's bound to win in the White House race Du-da-du-da-day.' "Speak to them of the question at issue before the people and they warble forthSI'm bound to run all night, I'm bound to run all day; I'll bet my money on the bob tail nag, "Will any body bet on the gray? Du-da-du-da-day.' "Thus," said he, "I have quoted from this favorite republican campaign song to illustrate the new party's principles and argument, the pith and burden of which is simply, Du-da-du-da-day." His sallies of wit and ridicule in thus "taking off" the republicans shook the sides of the little giant with laughter. I remember that, one evening during this campaign, after hearing Conrad Eberstein deliver a rousing republican speech to a large gathering in the old M. E. church in Battle Greek, I, with a number of republicans, went over to Wakelee's hall to hear John Van Arman, who spoke at a later hour. He had got fairly started as we took seats among. his eager listeners. And as we did so, we became at once interested in every word that he uttered. In fact, from that moment he held us the most delighted of listeners during his entire speech, while at its close, and at times during the speech, we found ourselves applauding him with all the admiration of democrats. We were democrats as far as the power of his oratory over us was concerned; he held us captive just as he did them, till his speech was delivered, and then it set us free. Such was the magic power of his oratory. This was in Van Arman's best days, before that severity of manner and language set in, which has, at times, so much detracted from some of his later public efforts. An incident of his practice over forty years ago has been related as follows:

THE ARSENIC INCIDENT.

"A stranger paced back and forth on the platform at the Union depot yesterJay afternoon. It was Col. John Van Arman, the well known lawyer of Chicago, and a representative of the Telegram-Herald walked up and greeted him. 'Colonel,' asked the reporter, 'how about that poisoned cake you are alleged to have eaten once upon a time in Michigan in order to convince a jury that your client was not a poisoner?' "The great criminal lawyer laughed. 'That story has al ways been mixed up, and I'll tell you the real facts of the case for the first time. It was in 1842. I was then twenty two years old, and had been admitted to the bar two years, and was in partnership with Attorney Brown at Marshall, Mich. A woman had been indicted at Hillsdale for poisoning her husband. He lived more than a year after the poisoning, and of course she could not be indicted for murder; yet giving poison was a penitentiary offense-amounting to a life sentence then-and I was engaged to defend her. The woman's husband was a witness against her, although he died soon after the trial. "Chemists in those days were few, and the prosecution subpoenaed the only one within a radius of 300 miles. It was proven on the trial that the husband had eaten a cake in which arsenic had been put, and he testified that one grain was a fatal dose. "\Well I took the chemist, judge and jury to a bakery and had the baker mix a cake in their presence and put in two grains of arsenic and bake the cake while they looked on. When done it was brought to the court by the judge. "I beganl by saying that the celebrated chemist had sworn that one grain of arsenic would produce death. In this cake were two grains, a fact which judge, jury and chemist acknowledged. I thereupon ate the cake, after which I began my address to the jury and spoke for three hours, at the end of which time I drew their attention t) the fact that I was not dead yet and dernmnded the acquittal of my client, which the jury did without leaving their seats.' "'llow dil you account for y)ur escape?' asked the reporter. "'Ol!' laughed the jolly Colonel, 'at that time I was used to eating from six to seven grains of arsenic without feeling the worse for it.' "'liho case was a celebrated one in Michigan and as yet remembered by old settlers, pirticularly in and about Hillsdale county, and it was the making of Col. Van Arman." Van Arnman was an honest lawyer; let the following vouch for it: Charles Lay, now of Chicago, was justice of the peace in LeRoy, Calhoun county, when, in 1843, John Kewoey, of Battle Creek, was tried befor him for tei crime of burning the barn of William Wilson. His brother-in-law, Van Arman, was Wilson's counsel. During the trial Justice Lay, after listening' to the discussion of a point of law by the lawyers, for an hour or more, and

285

still being so fogged that he could not come to a clear decision on the point, finally called Van Arman aside and asked him which one was right on the question. Van Arman* replied, "My opponent is right, and I am wrong." "This convinced me," says Justice Lay, "that Van Arman was an honest lawyer; he was so to me at any rate." We give a little incident to show how the justice got out of an unpleasant "fix' during this trial. Mr. Lay, having no blanks, had written out the warrant for Kewney's arrest, from memory, and had failed to p'ut in the first seatence: "To any sheriff or constable in the county, etc." While the lawyers were discussing the defect in the warrant, he was writing a new one, which, when finished, he gave to Ira Case, the constable, with instructions as to its use. And when the lawyers had finished their wrangle over the defective warrant, he formally discharged Kewney from the suit. The latter, overjoyed at his supposed release from the trial, was leaving the room when constable Case re-arrested him. He was then tried, the suit lasted nearly a week, found guilty and bound over for final trial in the circuit court at Marshall, where through Van Arman's able management he was convicted, and sentenced to five years in the state prison. He was not long there, for, while out of prison one day, with a squad of convicts, quarrying stone, he escaped from the officer in charge and was never re-arrested. It was afterwards learned that he went to Mishfwaka, where he died a number of years ago. I give the following incident which led to one of the most remarkable trials in central Michigan. While Mr. Chas. Lay, in 1841 or 1842, was building a barn for Mr. Bishop, brother-in-law of Ephraim Harrison, he boarded with the latter a part of the time. This was in South Climax. Harrison, knowing that Lay was fond of reading, said to him: "You will find a lot of newspapers in that trunk which will afford you all the reading you want." One day while he was searching for new reading matter among the papers, he discovered that the bottom of the trunk was covered with silver dollars-bogus dollars, that had been struck off, but had not yet been milled. He quietly slipped two into his pocket and, putting the papers back in the trunk, closed it and went to his work. The next day he consulted Daniel B. Eldred of Climax. The result was that constable Ira Case was soon equipped with the proper papers, and sparch was made on Harrison's premises, which led to the discovery of all the tools and implements for making bogus money. And to the astonishment of the peofle in central Michigan, John Gove Bean, deputy sheriff of Calhoun county, a well known and highly respected citizen of Marshall, was arrested as the head of this gang of counterfeiters. He was "*After the trial Van Arman said to Justice Lay, "When we lawyers "fog up" a point of law, and you can't see your way clear, just cling to the common sense of the case and you'll como out right."

CELEBRATED CASES.

tried, found guilty and served his sentence out in the state penitentiary, Harrison, on the alert, escaped to the western country.. Van Arman, I think, was on the side of the prosecution, in this trial. As a proof of Van Arman's high standing as a lawyer we have only to refer to the celebrated cases, in Michigan, in which he has been leading counsel. In the celebrated railroad conspiracy case, he represented the Michigan Central railroad against Abel Fitch. Mr. Fitch had secured William H. Seward for his counsel. This-was a long trial, and drew the attention of the whole country, from the eminence of the counsel engaged in it, and for the great importance attached to the charges brought against the defendant, Abel Fitch. It is not too much to say that it was the masterly manner and great ability he displayed in conducting the prosecution that won this case for his clients. William H. Seward said that Van Arman's final speech on this trial was one of the ablest forensic efforts of the day. He was counsel in the noted trial of White and Ulum for the murder of Estabrook, which was held at Centreville. He was also counsel for Vanderpool in his trial at Kalamazoo, where he was acquitted. Since he has lived in Chicago he has added still fresh laurels to his fame as a great lawyer. But his declining health has, within a few years, interfered much with his legal practice. HENRY W. TAYLOR. Henry W. Taylor, another member of the old bar, came to Marshall from Canandaigua, N. Y., some time in the thirties, and, after practicing in Marshall a number of years, returned to his old New York home. He was a good lawyer, but was too much of the old style gentleman to stand the "rough and tumble " of a new country. DAVID L. JOHNS AND OTHERS. Mr. Johns came from Ontario county, N. Y., to Marshall, Mich., in 1838, and, after a few years' sojourn, returned to New York. There were two brothers by the name of Willard, who, about 1839, came to Marshall from Oneida county, N. Y. They were called promising lawyers. They died a few years later in Marshall. Wm. Brown, J. Noyes, P. S. Hewett, Judge Woodruff and J. Wooley are among the old lawyers, who (save Hewett, who died many years ago) are living in Marshall. D. D. Hughes, O'Brien, and Fitzgerald removed from Marshall to Grand Rapids. JOHN S. OHIPMAN. Of the St. Joseph County Bar. John S. Chipman was born about 1800, in Bennington, Vermont, where he was reared and educated. He was a relative of the well known author, Chip9

man, who wrote the work on Contracts so much used by the legal fraternity. Amos Chipman, an early settler of Pavilion, Kalamazoo county, was of the same family. John S. Chipman, I have been informed, had a classical education. He must have been thirty eight years old when, in 1838, he came to Michigan, settling in Centerville, St. Joseph county. He was a member of our legislature in 1842, and elected to Congress in 1844. At the expiration of his term in Congress he located at Niles. Some time in 1849 or '50 he removed to San Francisco, California, where he died some twelve years later. From a returned Californian I got the following incidents connected with Chipman's life while in the land of gold: While digging for gold with some fellow miners he learned that one of the miners had a " claim " that was valuable, but it needed a lawyer and money to carry it to the courts and substantiate it. Chipman, not known among his fellow miners as a lawyer, made arrangements with this "claimant" to secure this valnable property for him, on condition that he, if he succeeded, was to have half of it. He then began to work up the case; and soon found, that, in miner's phrase, " he had struck a rich lead." He began the suit, carried it to the courts, and won it. His portion, says my informant, would have been called a fortune in Michigan, but he, with his habits of dissipation, amid the temptations of California life, soon lost it all. S. C. Coffinbury says of him: "Mr. Chipman was a remarkable man. In person he was tall and straight, above six feet high and slender. His head was large, complexion very dark, hair black, straight and thick, forehead low and broad; his eye dark and piercing; his appearance was that of an Indian sachem. You will see at once why he was universally called "Black Chip." He was a natural orator. His presence was commanding and impressive. His oratory was more forcible than pleasing; his metaphors and figures bold and clear, but coarse and impractical. He was- apt to lash himself into a fury of eloquence, and, like an angry lion, lacerate himself and his auditors by his own violence of language, of which he had great command in contentious debate. He was quick tempered and impatient under antagonism. His words contained not only ideas but feelings likewise, consequently he was wont to inebriate himself, if not his listeners, by means of passionate language. In private intercourse Ohipman was a man of great dignity and courtesy, until his habits of life became impaired by means of his immoral conduct. His legal education was good; he ranked high as an advocate, but as an orator his powers were more versatile. He tried cases with a good deal of legal ability, and as a counselor stood high with the members of the bar. He became a politician and democrat from conscientious convictions, and his ascendancy as a politician was marked by his declination as a lawyer, as well ) -

MANNERS AND CHARACTER.

as morally and socially." From the late Judge J. F. Littlejohn I received the following estimate of Chipman: "He was a man of strong elements of character. His notions were often erratic and visionary. His impulses gave the hue and complexion to both motive and conduct. His eloquence before public assemblies was at times of a high order; but its effect was frequently obscured by reckless assertions, and inconsequent deductions. His moral faculties were not properly developed." This portraiture agrees substantially with that drawn by Mr. Coffiubury. Chipman had in him all the passion and enthusiasm of the orator. Listening to one of his eloquent speeches was like reading from one of Cooper's novels. You were moved by the startling incident, the grand description, the dauntless spirit, and thrilling passages and scenes in which the speaker seemed the hero in real life. Chipman had something of the stern bearing and dignity of Chatham; something of Burke's love of the sublime; combined with these were the immoralities of a Wilkes. I was in the democratic convention at Kalamazoo in 1844, that nominated "Black Chip" for Congress. After the nomination he was "called out." As he stepped upon the rostrum, and looked upon the convention that had so honored him, he caught the inspiration for the occasion. In his speech he defined liberty. As the thought occurred to him his face lighted up, and who that saw him can forget his words, look, gesture, as he exclaimed, "Whence came liberty?" A pause, as he looked upward, and, in language as poetical and grand as Drake's on "The old Flag," he gave the answer in a magnificent burst of eloquence. Tumultuous applause greeted him as he finished his speech and thanked the convention for the great honor they had conferred upon him. His misfortunes in speech were sometimes more than metaphorical. When he said, in his speech in Congress, that "Education was at war with democracy," the expression was caught up and repeated all over the land, and soon came echoing back from " across the waters." Blackwood's Magazine, never at any time liking us, after giving a graphic description of our Congress, in a critical paper on "The Model Republic," and, after enumerating the leading statesmen in our national council, Webster, Clay, Calhoun and John Quincy Adams, the Nestor of this model republic,. the article closed with the dramatic performance of a "rude western member, who exclaimed in a grandiloquent speech-' Education is at war with democracy!' " to which the editor added, " Magnifique-superbe--PRETTY WELLl" No one who ever saw " Black Chip" in debate, when fully excited by the enemy's fire, can forget his remarkable appearance. At such times he was imperious, overbearing and defiant. I saw him in such a mood at the Centrcville bar, in 1848, Judge Osborne presiding. H. H. Riley, of Constantine,

then "on his first legs " as prosecutor for St. Joseph county, had taken a bold position against him in a suit they were trying. At this, "Chip" in all his stern dignity, addressed the court on the law in the case. Riley resolutely and ably maintained his position. The old barrister grew furious at being held in check by "this stripling in law," and, turning to the court, he exclaimed, " Am I, your honor, an old veteran, grown gray at the bar, to step aside and yield to the dictum of this upstart!" Nothing could equal the look of mingled scorn and defiance with which he said this. But Riley was not cowed by it. He then showed that he had in him the material of which lawyers are made. And when he thus, single handed, defiantly bearded the old lion in his den, we thought he had won his professional " spurs " in thus withstanding the most formidable foe he would ever meet at the bar of western Michigan. Riley, I think, gained the suit. 'Tis said that the lawyers in the olden time who lost their case in court, were accustomed to go over to the nearest tavern, and "take it out" in swearing at the judge, and abusing the opposing counsel. Black Chip, when he was defeated in court, used to take it out "by swearing at" the judge on the spot. He hated Judge -. At the close of a trial before him at Centreville, after having worked himself into a frenzy of feeling, he took a stand at the door of the court room, and waited for the decision from the bench. The decision came adverse to him. He, on hearing it, gave a fierce glance at the judge, and exclaimed in bitter, sarcastic tone, "The devil!" and instantly walked out of the room. At another time this judge's rulings against him had so excited him that he arose in his anger, and, addressing the court, said: "Now, by way of illustrating the point at issue, we will suppose that your honor is a d- fool." The judge, indignant, called him to order. Chipman turning to the court, with an imperious tone replied: "I know that I am out of order, but I was merely supposing that your honor was a d- fool," when the judge, exasperated beyond endurance, declared that he -would fine him for contempt of court. But he did not. The following will illustrate his impatience. An old man remarkable for his piety and parsimony consulted "Chip" professionally. Getting the pith of the matter he informed the old gentleman that his case had no merit. The latter still argued that he had a good case. Finally, the old barrister losing all patience with this would-be-client, Indignantly retorted, "I have told what the law is, and that you have no cause of action, and have told you truly. Now, G- d- you, give me ten dollars, and I will manage as you want, and commence suit for you!" The Kalamazoo county bar was distinguished for its able lawyers. I have 37

often seen its leading members pitted against those of the Marshall bar, as well as those from the Allegan, St. Joseph and Berrien county bars. This old forum has been the arena where many of the most important trials in western Michigan have taken place. Here Gordon, Bradley, Pratt and Van Arman have met Stuart, Balch, Belcher, Clark and Mower in legal conflict. Here Littlejohn, "Black Chip," Bacon and Dana have broken many a lance with some member of the old Kalamazoo bar. The surviving members of the old bar are Stuart, Balch and Breese. The lawyers who came here in the territorial days were men of adventurous spirit and sound legal ability. Chief among them were John Hascall, Lyman I. Daniels, Jeremiah Humphrey and Cyrus Lovell. The pioneer lawyer's first practice was before his honor, the justice of the peace, and it continued there till the district or circuit courts were established. The justice courts were usually held in log houses, and although as a rule there "was no superiority of law or learning, justice was substantially administered." Five dollars was the accustomed fee for a lawyer, and this was often paid in "dicker," as money could not always be obtained even by those rich in lands. And the technicalities of law were held to with somewhat less veneration than what was regarded as the essential claims of justice. Judge Ransom's advice to his brother Roswell, who was a territorial justice of the peace, was, "Avail yourself of all the clear law that you may have or can get, in regard to the matter at issue, and all that the lawyers on either side may bring out, but, whatever that may be, much or little, always stick to the facts and the common sense of the case, and you invariably will come to the most just conclusion." In fact, our pioneer justices were relieved from their lack or limitation of legal lore by relying on their own good sense and that of the jury to carry the case through right. A corrupt jury was a thing unheard of in the pioneer days. The infirmities of the jury system had not set in, and hence no difficulty was experienced from it, as a stern sense of justice not only prevailed among the early settlers of the state, but also in the court room, and largely governed the conduct of the lawyers who, thus restrained, did not descend to the mere technical arts of their profession, but took rather the broad ground of justice and right. GOVERNOR EPAPHRODITUS RANSOM. Epaphroditus Ransom was born in 1799, in Hampshire county, Mass., but removed when young, with his father's family, to Windham county, Vt. He was educated at Chester Academy, and read law with Peter B. Taft. He graduated from the law school at Northampton, Mass., in 1825, and went into practice in Windham county, Vt. He was twice elected to the Vermont

legislature. He came to Kalamazoo, Mich., in 1834, becoming a law partner with Charles E. Stuart. In 1836 he was appointed associate judge of the supreme court, and afterwards chief justice of the supreme court, which office he held till 1847, when he was elected governor of Michigan. From 1836 to 18-18 he was ex-officio circuit judge of the western district of this state. He wats a member of the state legislature in 1853-5. He removed to Kansas in 1856, having been appointed receiver of the U. S. land office located at Fort Scott, where he died Nov. 9, 1859, aged 63 years. Judge Ransom was a man of great probity. His perceptions of equity and justice between parties were clear, and upon them he generally relied. Upon the bench his practical common sense, aided by his desire to subserve the substantial ends of justice, were valuable supports. It was largely upon these qualities, and upon his clear knowledge of the law, that he ranked so high as an upright judge. Hon. L. W. Lovell, of' Climax, says of Judge Ransom: "I tecall his majestic appearance, the dignity with which he presided on the bench, which never left him in any of the walks of life. The people of Kalamazoo county early came to love him for his amiable and blameless life; to esteem and honor him for his strong common sense as a man, his ability and uprightness as a judge. And they can point with pride to the example of their first circuit judge under the state constitution, as worthy 6f imitatidn by his successors in time to come." Judge Ransom on the bench always appeared to me like a Sir Matthew Hale, presiding over the deliberations of those crafty disciples of Littleton and Coke, then practicing at the old bar, and, like the great English jurist, he would, with clear and just discriminations trace out from the intricate course of the trial the truth of the matter at issue, and administer impartial justice to the parties in the suit. I remember among the important cases tried before him, the following: A case that was tried two or three times for heavy damages to land and timber from the building of a mill dam; the noted malpractice case between Mr. Beals and Dr. N. M. Thomas, of Schoolcraft; the trial of Whiteman, of Battle Creek township, for the murder of his wife. When Whiteman received his sentence of twenty years' imprisonment, he replied to the judge: "Very well, I shall cheat you out of half of the sentence, for I don't intend to live but ten years." How near he came to this calculation, I do not know, but he died in prison before his time was out.

CHARLES E. STUART-CAREER.

CHARLES E. STUART. Charles E. Stuart was one of the ablest and most eloquent members of the old Kalamazoo bar, and stood in the front rank of the eminent lawyers of the state. He was born November 25, 1810, at Canaan Corners, Columbia county, N. Y. His father, some few years later, removed to Waterloo, Seneca county, N. Y., where Charles began and finished his educational course, taking his degrees in the "three R's" of the common school curriculum, with the additional attainment of grammar. This is all he ever got from the schools. He is preiminently a self-made man. At the age of nineteen he hung up his hat as a student in the law office of Birdsall & Clark, of Waterloo. He was admitted to the bar in Seneca county. He came to Michigan in the spring of 1835. When he came, he had no special place of settlement in view. Starting from Detroit he went first to Monroe, where he received tempting inducements to stay. Thence he passed, on his tour of observation, through Dundee, Tecumseh, Ypsilanti, Ann Arbor, Jackson and Marshall to Kalamazoo, arriving there June 23, 1835. He at once decided to make that place his home, and soon after formed a law partnership with Judge Ransom. In the fall of the same year he returned to Waterloo, Seneca county, N. Y., his former home, 4ud on the third of November was married to Miss Sophia S. Parsons, of the same place. Immediately after marriage the happy couple started for Kalamazoo, which has since then been their home. His native talent, legal ability and captivating address soon brought him abundant employment in his profession, in this and all the surrounding counties, and it need hardly be said that he was eminently successful and soon became distinguished. In the fall of 1841 he was elected a representative to the state legislature, with lion. Edwin H. Lothrop (brother of Hon. G. V. N. Lothrop, now minister to Russia), Judge F. J. Littlejohn, of Allegan, being elected state senator at the same time from the same district. In 1847 Col. Stuart was first elected to represent this district in Congress. The election was special, to fill a vacancy caused by the death of Hon. Edward Bradley, of Marshall. In 1848 he was defeated of reflection, but was again elected in 1850. In the winter of 1852-3 he was elected by the legislature to the United States Senate, and served in that body till March 4, 1859. He is, to date, the last democratic senator from this state. As representative and senator, in Congress, he was distinguished among distinguished men, for great parliamentary knowledge and skill, and for ability and vigor in debate. Because

of his parliamentary ability he was often called to preside, temporarily, over the deliberations of the Senate. le was also president pro tem. of the Senate. In 1859 he was made delegate at large to the national democratic convention which met first at Charleston, S. 0., and adjourned to meet at Baltimore, Md. In this convention he was the chosen leader of the "Douglas men," and on the floor of that convention directed their parliamentary tactics and debate. In the campaign that followed he was an earnest and vigorous advocate of the position of the Douglas democracy. In 1862 he was commissioned by Gov. Austin Blair to raise and equip the 13th regiment of Michigan Infantry, which did gallant duty during the war, and of whose history and achievements Kalamazoo will always be proud. In 1866 he was elected a delegate to the union convention held at Philadelphia. In 1868 he was delegate at large to the national democratic convention held at New York, by which Horatio Seymour was nominated for the presidency. This was the last occasion on which he represented the people of Michigan in the capacity of a representative or delegate; but, during the seventeen years that have followed, his interest in public affairs has never waned, and on many occasions, by speech and pen, he has discussed public questions with his old time vigor and ability. Few who heard his speech at Union hall one year ago will forget the pungent force and thrilling eloquence with which he discussed the political situation.* While a member of the House of Representatives, he was instrumental in procuring a law of incalculable benefit to Michigan industries. A distinguished associate member of the Senate has said that Mr. Stuart was the ablest presiding officer of a deliberative assembly that he ever knew. " I never had time," says Senator Stuart, " to read books when I was young, and since I began my profession I have been too busy to read outside of my practice." He likes books that treat of scientific subjects, philosophy, logic, poetry and music. Of the latter he is passionately fond. Burns is his favorite poet. It has been said that he never made a speech in which he did not quote his favorite bard. Stuart's professional life has been a school in which he has been an apt and diligent pupil. He reads a book rapidly, if you would call it reading, glancing at the top Of the page and running his eye down it, and he has gathered its whole meaning, without the labor of getting it line by line. He, as was said of S. S. Prentiss, "read two pages at a Itime, one with his right eye and one with his left;" and, like Prentiss, he was a lawyer of quick perceptions, of clear ideas upon any case in hand, while no one equalled *The above is mostly from a sketch of Senator Stuart's life read by Dr. F. Pratt on the occasion of the golden wedding of Mr. and Mrs. Stuart, in Kalamazoo, November 38, 1885.

MANNER AS A SPEAKER.

him "in the faculty of thinking on his legs." He had a fine command of language, and a charm in delivery that sent each word with its distinct message to his bearers. Speech has three parts, words, look and tone; to the parts of oratory, gestuire must be added, and in Stuart's gesture was an art carried to its highest finish. There was talent in his manner of speaking; there was argument in his diction, in the clearness of his utterances, given with an impressiveness that stamped them on the memory. And the effect of his words and of his logic was improved by a natural arrangement, and the effect of his rhetoric by a natural style. His personal appearance was faultless; he was at once commanding and graceful, just above the medium height and compactly built. A fine eye lighted up a classic head and face.. "His voice was both clear and full; its lowest tones distinctly heard in cadences of peculiar charm, while in its highest compass it captivated all with its Ciceronian flow." There was a persuasive eloquence in the movement of his lips. This was before the day of the moustache, or the habit of public speakers wearing a hirsute mask over the mouth, concealing the expression of the lips, the smile, and the entire facial language, which constitutes the charm and soul of delivery. There was something peculiarly pleasing in Stuart's countenance and features, " something indicative of intellect, humor and good sense.'" And, in support of all these merits, was a suavity of temper that seemed toÃ½ set at defiance all attempts to ruffle or discompose it. His cause or his client never suffered from his rashness, legal tricks, or abuse, or severity to a witness or an opponent, so much in vogue among lawyers nowadays, for, in the hottest contests with his professional foes, he never lost poise or temper, but, even when hardest pushed, evinced a moderation that was wonderful. From this arose much of his success as an advocate. It has generally been acknowledged that, in those forensic contests with his opponents he wielded a blade whose ring and gleam and cut proved it to be of genuine Damascus steel. He never used manuscript or notes. In the most complicated trial his retentive memory held all the evidence. Stuart's genius had led him to the study of law, and he had followed that genius so closely that it revealed to him the secret to success in his chosen profession, thus enabling him to master all its difficulties, and to win the highest honors attainable in that profession. As a debater Stuart approached the question by a natural reasoning. He was adroit in shifting his ground when attacked in time to avoid a blow from his enemy, while his keen glance detected any defect in the armor of his foe, and his ready blade soon found the weak part. And most valuable of all, as a debater, he had the intuitive perception to discern the pith of the matter at issue, the courage to seize it, and the intellectual power to maintain his

295

possession. High intellectual endowment, keen perception and courage naturally qualified Charles E. Stuart for the highest attainments at the bar or in the political arena. In his arguments before the court or jury, on the stump, or in legislative halls, he has evinced wonderful fertility in resources, and has always proved himself equal to the occasion. His style of speaking, his logic, and his rhetoric are so peculiarly his own that they have become classic to his hearers. Those who have thought Stuart a mere jury lawyer little understood him. He was strong both before court and jury. He knew how to reach both, for he was a logical reasoner as well as a successful advocate. A well known writer who knew Mr. Stuart well, says of him: "On coming here in 1835 he arose at once to the head of his profession in western Michigan. The courts of this and adjoining counties show his name in connection with nearly all the important cases during 1836 and the succeeding fifteen years. His brilliant political career is a matter of history. As an advocate Mr. Stuart had few if any superiors in Michigan. He seemed to be able to take the jurors into his confidence and by his talk win them completely to his cause. He was a natural lawyer and a self made man, his inherent gifts seemed sufficient for any emergency, legal propositions were as readily grasped as the simplest problems. The fame of his remarkable success as an advocate still lingers, though nearly all of those who knew him as such have passed away. Col. Stuart in many other ways became prominent. He was a close friend of Douglas, and no man in Michigan enjoyed more the confidence of the democratic leaders of the nation than he. Very few of the older citizens of Michigan but know him as the devoted agriculturist, the successful lawyer, and the pure and patriotic statesman." Mr. Stuart, on account of ill health, some number of years ago retired from the practice of his profession. His mind is yet clear and vigorous. Like Fox, in his retirement he gives himself to his books and friends. He is the social, genial gentleman at home; a fine conversationalist and an interesting raconteur. In the noted "malpractice case" of Beals vs. Dr. N. M.,Thomas, tried at Kalamazoo before Judge Ransom in 1814, Stuart was at his best. A young daughter of the plaintiff had injured her arm, Dr. Thomas treated it as a fracture; the plaintiff claimed that it was only a dislocation at the elbow, and brought suit to recover damages, as the arm was yet partly useless. The jury was an unusually intelligent one. When a trial of importance was on, the students of the "Old Branch" used to take some text book and go over to the court room, and "hunt out their lessons" in the dull intervals of the trial. Although I had heard Stuart in most of his great efforts at this bar, yet at this time he surpassed himself. Always admired as

FORENSIC ABILITY.

a model orator by the students, here he was to us a Cicero in real life. His power over that court and jury was a masterly achievement of argument and oratory. He often had them in tears, and we remember that the sturdy old pioneer clergyman, Rev. Mason Knappen, one of the jurors, cried like a child. The whole court and attendant crowd hung with breathless attention on every word he uttered, and when he had finished, it seemed to us that there were no higher forensic honors in his profession for him to win, and that he could then retire with fame enough. He won the case. His opponents were N. A. Balch and James Wright Gordon. As this was a case of malpractice, the highest medical or surgical authorities in the west were summoned as witnesses. All the noted physicians in central Michigan were present, besides Dr. Zina Pitcher, of Detroit, the learned and erratic Dr. Lamborn, Prof. Meeker of the La Porte school, and President Brainard of the Rush Medical College of Chicago, who were on the witness stand. Fitch and Gilbert, of Marshall, had attached Judge Lee's goods for debts, and in taking out the attachment Gilbert had made a great mistake, in swearing that Judge Lee was about to defraud them of the debt in removing his goods. This was not true, and Pratt, Lee's law partner, had Gilbert indicted for perjury. The case now became serious, as Pratt's hatred of Fitch, who was a radical abolitionist, now took a more violent political turn. Gilbert, alarmed, speedily secured Gordon, Bradley, Van Arman, and Stuart as his counsel. Bradley and Gordon withdrew, and Van Arman, whom all wished to retain, was considered too aggressive to get along with Pratt, for the case was lost unless Pratt was pacified. It was an admirable stroke of policy in giving Stuart the management of the suit. To add to the difficulty the "sworn twelve" were known to be bitter democrats. Pratt seemed to have the case entirely in his own hands, and thoughts of the penitentiary loomed up in Gilbert's mind. Stuart's defense was a masterpiece of legal tactics in managing Abner Pratt when mad. He based that defense on the proposition that his client did wrong in attaching Judge Lee's goods; that Pratt did right in indicting Gilbert. But the question with the jury wasdid Gilbert intend to commit perjury? To convict him they must have proof of that. There was no proof that he even intended to swear false, or to misinterpret the case against Lee. It was a mistake, a blunder of an impulsive young man, with no intention of committing a legal or a moral wrong. Before he had been talking twenty minutes he had judge and jury in tears. Had that speech been preserved, says one who heard it, it would have been called the greatest forensic achievement of Stuart's life. Mr. Stuart himself is inclined to this belief. Stuart's style was eminently persuasive. It enabled him at this time to enforce the essential facts in the case

297

with a pathos that.carried both judge and jury. And it set at naught the idea that his strength lay mainly with the jury, and in the blandishment of his oratory. This would excite laughter in those who knew Judge Pratt. To think that the tactful blandishments of oratory could move him. No, the reverse of this was true. There was so much hard sense, sound logic, and law, in the defense of his client, that the Achillean wrath of Abner Pratt was subdued by it, court and jury carried, and Gilbert acquitted. This case reminds us of this fact, that a client's cause, as well as truth and justice, often suffer in the court room nowadays, by the harsh and overbearing manner of practitioners toward opposing counsel, or adverse witnesses. Many lawyers show a lack of common courtesy, as well as common sense, in the management of their suits; and if they only knew how much they go at discount, for this very reasori, with judge and jury, they would not only mend their pleas, but also their manners, at the bar. We think the old lawyers clung closer to the law and the facts in the case, than their successors at the bar do. The practice was simpler then, less text-books to study and authorities to quote, and they plainer and more direct. The old lawyer seemed to try the case more on its merits, and seemed less inclined to resort to legal technicalities to win his suit. Stuart not only knew how to present his client's cause and argue it before judge and jury with consummate ability, but to do it in such a manner as to win favor even from the opposite party for his fairness and candor in trying the case. He has said that it took him forty years to learn how to make a speech. In this saying he evinced the true idea of the orator, for although he soon learned how to make a good speech, yet, like the true artist, he was not satisfied till he had produced the masterpiece of his art. This he has done. Since the above sketch was written Mr. Stuart has passed away. He died at his late home in Kalamazoo on the 12th day of May, 1887, in the 77th year of his age. NATHANIEL A. BALCH. Nathaniel A. Balch, the Nestor of the Kalamazoo bar, was born at Athens, Windham county, Vermont,. on the 22d of January, 1808. He fitted for college at Chester academy and graduated at Middlebury in 1835. He was principal of the Bennington academy for two years. He read law with Gov. John S. Robinson, of Bennington. He also read medicine and quite extensively in theology before he left his native state. He removed to Kalamazoo, Mich., in 1837, and became a law student of Stuart & Webster. He had charge of the Kalamazoo Huron Institute for 38

some time, and in 1838 became principal of Marshall college, where he remained two years. He was admitted to the bar in 1842; was prosecuting attorney for Kalamazoo and Barry counties, and member of the state senate in 1847. Mr. Balch is an able Greek and Latin scholar, and has been a diligent student in acquiring knowledge during his entire professional life. His broad and thorough reading has fully equipped him for the discussion not only of law questions but of all others. Hence at the bar he has been a formidable opponent-one strongly entrenched in argument and very difficult to defeat. HIe has been called the metaphysician of the Kalamazoo bar. A close reader, he thought over his cases profoundly. He had the faculty of not only working up a strong case for his client, but of so identifying himself with his client's cause as to make it his own. His language is good, his address forcible and commanding; for behind all his legal learning and attainments one recognizes the intellectual power of the man. Mr. Balch when fully aroused was a master in argument. He brushed aside technicalities, when in his way, as mere cobwebs; and, on the other hand, made them strong as iron if his case needed their support. During forty years' practice he has been counsel in most of the important trials in western Michigan. Mr. Balch is an able impromptu speaker on almost any subject, holding the closest attention of his audience at all times. The same may be said of him as a conversationalist. He can draw from his rich stores of knowledge something to entertain and instruct any company. He has been president of the Kalamazoo bar association from its earliest organization. He has now retired from practice. ELISHA BELCHER. Elisha Belcher was born in Rhode Island, in 1800; came when a child to Massachusetts, and when a young man removed to Ohio. He was a student in Kenyon college where he got enough of the classics to aid him in his profession in after years. In 1826 he located at Ann Arbor, Mich., and later removed to Ionia. He must have picked up his profession along the way between Massachusetts and Ionia, for he appears as attorney in some of the early cases in the latter place. He came to Kalamazoo in 1834, and soon became one of the leading lawyers of the west. He removed to Otsego in 1850 and died there in 1852. Mr. Belcher was a man of close observation and an apt student in the common school of life. Having worked up from the ranks of hard toil he had retained the plain manners of, and the close sympathy with, the class from which he sprung. And when he became an able lawyer his plain habits made him hosts of friends. His unadorned speech, sincerity and candor, won

299

their way to the hearts of the jury, and were potent in establishing his own convictions upon their minds. Belcher had a large, muscular frame, and great vigor of body and mind. A clear, logical reasoner, his argument was marked more by strength than beauty of diction. And when he had once presented his case to the " sworn twelve," if the verdict was not in his favor, his defeat never hurt him; for, as lawyer and man, he stood high with court, jury, and people. It is sad to reflect on what Belcher might have been. There was enough native talent, legal ability, solid attainments, genial humor, and sterling manhood enslaved by the habit of strong drink to have placed him in the front rank of our western bar, and to have made him distinguished among his fellow citizens, and in the councils of the Nation. Belcher's office was always a pleasant resort for the Branch students, in whom he was ever interested, and always took pleasure in giving them advice in their studies. M any a delightful reminiscence did he give them from his life in Kenyon college. And, speaking of his habits, he freely acknowledged that he was a slave to "rum," and warned them never to take the first glass. That was their only safety. Kind recollections of the old barrister are yet fresh in the memory of his student friends. JOSEPH MILLER. Joseph Miller was born in Litchfield county, Ct., Dec. 13, 1816, and got his education in an academy at that place. He began reading law in his father's office; completed his course and removed to Kalamazoo, Mich., in 1837, where he was admitted to the bar. He was a law partner of 0. E. Stuart for many years, and was made United States district attorney for this district, by President Buchanan. He died April 6, 1861. Mr. Miller displayed marked ability in the preparation of his cases, was correct in citations of law, accurate and concise in argument, logical and effective in his brief speeches before the bar. Getting the pith of a client's case, if there was a possible chance for friendly adjustment between the parties he always urged it. How much bitter feud and money " Joe" Miller has saved citizens of this county, by such sound advice, who can tell? The old law office of " Stuart & Miller" in 1843 was on the east side of Portage street, Kalamazoo. It was in this old office that Joe Miller, as the legal Vulcan, forged the weapons for his partner, Stuart, to use in combat with their foes in the court room. Let Miller fit the case for trial, and let Stuart present it to the jury, and the verdict of the "stubborn twelve," it was usually thought, would be given in their favor. Miller was a lawyer of close and profound research. With him knowledge came by analysis and close inductive reasoning. If

HORACE MOWER.

there was an imperfection in the law, or a flaw in the argument of his opponent, his eagle eye detected it at a glance. He excelled in the "weightier matters of the law." He was at first merely a court, but eventually became a jury lawyer as well. As he grew in practice his reading became more extensive, till in the zenith of his fame he was the peer of the foremost jurist in western Michigan. HORACE MOWER. Horace Mower was born in Woodstock, Winsor county, Vt. He graduated at Dartmouth college, read law with Hon. Andrew Tracey, of Woodstock, and came to Kalamazoo in 1838; was a member of the state legislature in 1847, and appointed judge of New Mexico, and served two years. He had a fine classical education, and was the finest belles lettres scholar in Kalamazoo. He was affable, gentlemanly, social, and had wit and humor. He was an astute lawyer, and, in his best days, was the pride and ornament of the Kalamazoo bar. As a lawyer he was not as logical, as a thinker he was not as profound as some of his compeers, but he was endowed with extraordinary tact and was full of expedient and resource. He was not noted for sustained oratory, but with an occasional burst of genuine eloquence he would carry his audience by storm. His irony and satire were inimitable, and often fell with withering effect upon his opponent or an obstinate witness. He was compactly built, of medium size, had an aquiline nose, and an eye like a falcon, was always neatly dressed, walked with an elastic step, evincing the energetic, stirring man. He was quick to see the weak point in an enemy's argument or design, and as quick to give a thrust, which he did so dexterously that surprise and discomfiture came at one stroke. The old whig party had in him a leader, strong, eloquent and brave. No man in this entire border had more influence among the old whigs than had Horace Mower. Says Hon. Gilbert E. Reed, of Richland: "Horace Mower was the sharpest lawyer in western Michigan. Had he lived and remained free from dissipation, he would have been one of the first of the bar of this state. In his best days he was the strongest man in the old whig party in this part of the state." He died Dec. 11, 1860. MARSH GIDDINGS.* Marsh Giddings was born Nov. 19, 1816, in Sherman, Fairfield county,,Oonnecticut. He was the son of William aud Jane (Ely) Giddings, who removed with their family to Richland, Kalamazoo county, Michigan, in 1830. His father died that same year. Marsh early manifested a fondness for books * See voL 6, page 876.

and study. In 1834 he entered Western Reserve college, at Hudson, Ohio, but lack of means prevented him from completing his course. At the age of twenty one he was elected justice of the peace for Richland township, and held the office for many years. As justice of the peace he gave general satisfaction, being always just, thorough and exact. He was elected to the state legislature in 1849. His thorough acquaintance with the wants of, the locality and hearty identity with its interests, combined with his parliamentary ability and ready talent for debate made him a valuable representative. In 1860 he was a delegate to the republican national convention, held at Chicago, and was earnest in his efforts to secure the nomination of William H. Seward. He was a presidential elector the same year, and was also elected probate judge of Kalamazoo county, which office he held for eight years. From 1864 to 1868 he was a member of the national republican committee. He was a member of the convention which revised the state constitution in 1867. In 1869 he was commissioned consul general at Calcutta, but, fearing the effect of the climate on his health, he declined the appointment. One year later he was appointed governor of New Mexico. This position he accepted, and held at the time of his death, which occurred at Santa F6, New Mexico, June 3, 1875. Hec married, in 1836, Louisa Mills, daughter of Augustus Mills, of Richland. ' His wife and two children survive him. He was an esteemed member of the Congregational church for many years before his death. Judge Giddings was a man whose physical weakness was the more marked by contrast with his rare intellectual strength. A quick, retentive memory made him-an invaluable assistant in historical and legal research, and, coupled with his gift of clear expression, made him an effective speaker and a powerful advocate. He was a well read lawyer, and his cool judgment and knowledge of human nature made him a safe counselor. Poor health compelled him, in later years, to avoid the excitement of litigation in the courts. He excelled in the thorough preparation of his cases. He disliked to be tied to law precedents-looked upon them as old, lacking common sense. As a public speaker, he was forcible, argumentative, often sarcastic, and sometimes eloquent. Much of his time was devoted to politics, and few men in the state were better known, or better versed in the political history of the country. A zealous whig, he took a prominent part in the formation of the republican party. He was a partisan from conviction, and was very influential in molding the course of the party which he had espoused. He was at home in a political conveution; here "his foot was on his native heath," and he was master of the situation. He was unsurpassed in doing effectual work for his party among a body of its representative men. Although outspoken in his political opinions, he had

few enemies; since even when party feeling ran highest, he rarely allowed himself to speak unkindly of any one. He was eminently social in disposition, and everywhere genial and companionable. Those knew him best who knew him at his home. His wide familiarity with literature, his love of poetry and music, his quick appreciation of character, his exhaustless fund of anecdote, all contributed to his rare gifts as a conversationalist, and made his home a charming place. In all his relations, official and private, his influence was exerted in behalf of the best public interests; and his loss was sincerely regretted, not by his personal friends alone, but by multitudes who valued highly his public services. As a rule it is always the easiest to do the best thing. Giddings knew how to try a lawsuit, because he went at it in the most natural and easy way. The habitues of the old court room of thirty five years ago say that he tried a case in the coolest, fairest and pleasantest manner of any lawyer they ever knew. He never lost anything by excitement or anger during the conflict of the trial. He would get along with the most difficult matter, the most obdurate witness. the most disagreeable and carping opponent, in the easiest manner possible. Trying a lawsuit, after all, is an affair in which the equable temper and manner of the lawyer have so much to do that they may be said often to turn the suit injhis favor. Giddings carried his accustomed suaviter in modo into the court room, and made it as effectual in the conduct of business there as he did in social life. Knowing that mankind everywhere recognize "fair play as a jewel," he made a lawsuit no exception to its use. While he respected and got along well with an honest pettifogger, yet he repudiated the "pettifogging" so much in vogue among a certain class of lawyers. Said he to one of the latter class, in a suit he was trying with him: "Now, B--, don't let us pettifog this case, but let us reason it through, like lawyers." At another time he said: "E- is a pettifogger, but he always argues his case like a lawyer; while, on the other hand, M--- is a lawyer, but he always pettifogs his case, whether in a justice or in a cir-' cuit court, and he always makes a long plea in every trivial suit, and bursts into rhetoric over every trivial incident." The judge's family were all gifted with a natural talent for music, and culture had given them rare attainments in this art. The writer, who for many years had been an occasional guest in their delightful home at Galesburg and Kalamazoo, still remembers with pleasure the rich musical treats he has enjoyed there, and how he and his cherished friend, the judge, "Long, long through hour, the night and the chimes, Would talk of old books, old friends and old times." A few years ago, while traveling in the southern part of this state, I met

many people who still spoke with enthusiasm. of the old political campaigns when Marsh Giddings and "Charley" Stuart were "stumping it" in that part of the country; and as political orators they yet held the highest rank in their estimation. Giddings was thoroughly versed in politics. He was master of his subject, and when he appeared at the hustings was always ready to make an able and effective speech. He used to remind me of Daniel S. Dickinson, the celebrated political orator of New York. Like Dickinson, the very soul of a genial nature beamed from his countenance, and, like him, he had wit, a natural vein of drollery, aptness in illustration, a love of scripture quotations, and a rich fund of anecdotes and poetry, all of which enabled him Lo illustrate his argument, give point to his logic and carry conviction to the minds of his hearers. He would often win over or carry the crowd by persuasive humor where others would fail by mere serious argument. Let him speak in whatever place he would, there was a kindly manner, an air of sociability about him that won his way to the hearts of the people. He felt at home at the hustings and made his hearers feel that he was their friend. Of all political speakers that I ever heard none surpassed Marsh Giddings in the peculiar power of winning over his hearers by "putting himself in their place." "lMy democratic friend," he would say, "may differ from me as to whom he will vote for at the coming election. This comes from our viewing the matter from different standpoints. Now if he will listen, and I know he will, while I present the matter from my standpoint, and give the reason for my voting the whig or republican ticket (as the case might be) this fall, he will have this advantage, he will have a republican's reason for the faith that is in him, which, when fully understood, may be strong enough to influence him to vote right hereafter." Thus he would reason and hold a democrat interested and instructed till his speech waa finished, which, in many cases, has brought the democrat to see the matter as the speaker saw it, and to vote as he voted. As has been said of a distinguished American orator, in regard to this peculiar power in influencing an audience, we can say of Giddings: "In whatever crowd or assembly he might be his mind would catch with marvelous facility the general tendency of the mind of the audience, and a chemical process, as it were, would take place within his mind. How could he fail then to force attention of those to whom he returned their own thoughts strengthened, broadened, and adorned with superb flights of eloquence.', A REMINISCENCE OF THE OLD WHIG DAYS. Horace Mower and Marsh Giddings were the popular whig orators in central Michigan. And it was largely due to their zeal and eloquence in the

A REMINISCENCE.

whig cause, that the whigs of Kalamazoo county rallied in such large numbers, and were so well represented in the great whig mass meeting at Marshall in the presidential campaign of 1844. The old whig party in this campaign tried to repeat the political coup d'etat of 1840, and carry the election by public parade and song. Kalamazoo county whigs outdid themselves in their efforts to get up a large delegation for Marshall on this occasion. The towns in the county seemed to vie with each other in their endeavor to muster the most men. The procession that left the "burr oak city" was one mile long, and took the banner for the largest delegation. But the Portage delegation, all things considered, took the banner for Kalamazoo county. A. K. Burson, of Prairie Ronde, drove a four horse team, tricked off with banners and bells in real Canestoga style. Richland furnished a four horse team, with whom went Giddings and Gilbert E. Reed. From the latter I got this reminiscence. Grand Prairie sent an eight horse team, gay with banners, and lively with music. An unique feature of the procession was a delegation of native Americans from Kalamazoo, led by Selkrig and Joy, bedizened in war paint and feathers, sitting in a monster canoe on wheels, drawn by four horses. The procession stopped at Battle Creek and the oratcrs, Mower, Giddings and Dr. Isaac Lamborn, made speeches from the old Battle Creek house balcony. The "old Doctor," who spoke for an hour or more, in his whig enthusiasm made this remarkable declaration: "Fellow citizens, there are really but three great men in America. Daniel Webster is one, Henry Clay is another, and the third, modesty forbids me to mention!" At Marshall the great whig orators, Frank Granger, of New York, and Thayer, of Boston, and others, addressed this rousing whig mass meeting. Ossian E. Dodge, the famous singer, sang his most popular whig songs, and, among others, " Such a nominee, as Jimmy K. Polk, of Tennessee." A misfortune met the procession at Battle Creek. Some unfriendly persons stole the canoe. Of course the whigs laid the theft to the democrats. The Richland delegation did not get back from Marshall under three or four days. FLAVIUS J. LITTLEJOHN,* Of the Allegan Bar. Judge Littlejohn's ancestry was Scotch on his father's side, and English on his mother's side. His grandparents came from England and settled near Boston, Massachusetts. Mr. Littlejohn's parents removed from Worcester, Mass., to Litchfield, Herkimer county, New York, where all but the two oldest of a family of twelve children were born. The names of the children * See vol. 3, page 810.

are, John; Tilley, Levi S., Mary (Mrs. Amasa Pratt), Silas F., Augustus, Flavius J., Lydia (Mrs. Wells), Philo B., Elizabeth, Charlotte (Mrs. Marsh), and Gilbert H. The writer of this sketch remembers John, who was a Presbyterian clergyman and revivalist, and Augustus, clergyman and temperance lecturer, a sketch of whom will be found in volume 5 of these collections. Flavius Josephus Littlejohn was born in Litchfield, Herkimer county, N. Y., July 20, 1804. He remembered the war of 1812. He had the benefit of the common schools of Litchfield, and fitted for college at the Whitesborough academy, in Whitestown, Oneida county. He entered Hamilton college at Clinton, N. Y., in 1824, and graduated in 1827 with the valedictory and first honors of his class. He read law and prepared for his profession in Herkimer village with Hoffman & Hunt, and entered upon his practice in 1830 at Herkimer. His first suit was at Utica, Oneida county, and his opponent in this trial was the celebrated Alvan Stewart, who was the James Otis of the moral revolution of his day. And despite the able counsel opposed to him he won the suit. He practiced law two years at Little Falls, Herkimer county. In one of his suits he was taken with bleeding at the lungs in the court room. This compelled him to abandon, for a time, his chosen profession. In the spring of 1836 he came to Michigan for the benefit of his health, and to improve it he sought out door work. Having first settled at Allegan, which was then nearly an unreclaimed wilderness, he became surveyor, engineer, geologist and lawyer by turns. He surveyed the west end of the proposed routes of the Clinton and Kalamazoo canals. At the end of eight years he returned to the practice of his profession in Allegan. In 1842 he was elected to the legislature, where he made his mark and was relected twice, and then, in 1847, was sent to the state senate, and was president pro tem. of that body during the long session of 1816, when the revised statutes were discussed and adopted. In 1818 he was again elected to the house, and sat in-the first legislature which assembled in the then new capitol at Lansing. He was also a member of the legislature of 1855. In the interval he practiced law. In 1858 he was elected circuit judge, and tried the first case in the new county of Muskegon in 1859. His circuit was one of very large extent, when there were but few roads; and it entailed on him the most severe labors. In 1866 his circuit was changed to Van Buren, Kalamazoo and Allegan counties. He was at first an anti-slavery man of the old school. Then he became a free soiler, and ran on the first free soil and whig ticket, in 1849, for governor against John S. Barry, democrat, receiving 23,540 votes against 27,837 for his opponent. He finally became a democrat. But in whatever party 39

POLITICS-POWER AS AN ORATOR.

he was, while he remained in it he was an ardent and able advocate of its cause. He was one of Michigan's pioneer politicians and jurists, and a man who, at various periods, has occupied a conspicuous place in public estimation, and who, had he been less erratic in politics, might have been a notable power in the state and nation. He died at his home in Allegan on the 21st of May, 1880. In person Littlejohn was tall and commanding, and had a dignity of bearing that made one think of Chatham, while a dark, piercing eye revealed the man of intellectual power. And, as was said of Pinckney, he had enough intellectual jewelry to have equipped two or three orators. The first utterance claimed your attention; the orator held you through his entire speech subject to his control, for there was a glowing warmth of feeling which communicated itself to his auditors and carried them with him whether they agreed with his argument or not. As his eloquence sprang from the inspiration of great thoughts he carried his listeners, in the discussion of his theme, through the higher intellectual realms. His imagination was vivid and clothed his subject with beauty and grandeur. By some he was called a florid speaker. But his rhetoric, be it ever so florid, always gave point to his logic. The picture was not overdrawn, for he was always clear and well understood. The orator is a painter, merely using words instead of colors, to depict the scene. Littlejohn was in his best days a Rubens who painted grand pictures that were always faithful and true to life. He spurned affected phrase, his words flowed with an inherent force, and the simplicity of a bird song, each one carrying a message to the mind of the hearers not to be forgotten. "The best things in his speeches were the sudden flashes and the thoughts not dreamed of before." Here is where Littlejohn, as an orator, found his great opportunity; when these new thoughts inspired him his language would have "the power of prose to take poetic tone, the power which loads a sentence with impressiveness" and enabled him to carry his audience to the height of enthusiasm by his grand eloquence. The true orator's thoughts receive color from his surroundings, and he is better understood when he speaks through them to his auditors. Littlejohn, in his speech at Battle Creek, in the political campaign of 1856, seeing in the hickory pole, that had just been erected, an emblem of the democratic party, exclaimed: "That hickory pole, standing firm and strong while bearing aloft the flag of our Union, represents the leader of our party, proudly bearing aloft our time honored banner. That pole is sound to the heart like the principles of our party and, like it, clad in an invulnerable armor for the handling of its enemies." I have given but a crude idea of his illustration, but as he gave it in his own graphic and eloquent words, it was received with



Page 307
HIS HUMANITY AS A JUDGE.

307

tumultuous applause. Wm. A., Blake and Jas. H. Hopkins, of Galesburg, who heard Littlejohn during this campaign, say that his eloquence was grand beyond description. P. H. Whitford says he went from Galesburg to Marshall on July 4, 1845, to hear Littlejohn deliver an oration there. The orator stood on the steps of the old court house, and when he came to the point where the revolutionary sires were summoned to arms, he raised his hands, as he stepped forward, while his voice thrilled through the large audience and made every heart beat with a patriotic fervor, and everyone present feel like going to battle. He inspired the auditors' hearts with the lofty feelings of his own. "I shall never forget," says AMr. Whitford, "that eloquent appeal to arms, nor that overpowering thrill of emotion that went through that vast crowd." Hon. S. F. Brown, of Schoolcraft, who heard Littlejohn deliver a Fourth of July oration at that place some time in the "fifties," says he was a most eloquent man. Hon. C. E. Stuart, of Kalamazoo, told the writer that he considers the speech that Littlejohn made in Detroit, at a democratic meeting, the most eloquent speech he ever heard. Nature had not only endowed Littlejohn with an intellect of the highest order, but she had given him all those gifts that lead to eminence in public life. In addition to these gifts he possessed a judicial mind, legal acumen, and keen discrimination, that enabled him readily to distinguish between right and wrong, and to. see at a glance what the average judge would have to get by study and reflection. His sense of justice was so strong that his feelings or emotional nature did not deter him from coming to and holding just and legal conclusions. It has been considered one of the most difficult things for a judge to keep his feelings from swaying his judgment. The opinion rigidly obtains that the technical heart of the stern judge must be proof against the feelings of sympathy, charity, or any expression of pity toward the accused. Law has a head to think and decide, and an'arm to execute, but it has no heart and cannot feel. Its stern dictum, expressed through its highest judicial functionary, must decide where the right and the wrong lies in every case. But in doing this the judge should always be humane. If Littlejohn erred, as judge, it was on the side of humanity. His large sympathetic nature may have often moved him to temper the severity of the law to the condition of the criminal at the bar. Ezra Beckwith, of Galesburg, who has often served as juror when Littlejohn was on the bench at Kalamazoo, says: "I have seen the tears fall, down Judge Littlejohn's cheeks while giving sentence to a criminal. A young man, probably demented, had obtained some property by false pretenses. The jury, trying him, brought in a verdict against the young man. Littlejohn,



Page 308

INCIDENTS.

in addressing him, said: "Your sentence should have been non compos mentis, but as the jury have brought you in guilty, I will make it as light as possible. It will be twenty dollars, or twenty days in jail. Which would you prefer?" The father of the boy urged the twenty days in jail as best. It was enforced. "The case following this," says Mr. Beckwith, "was that of a bigamist. A. man had married when his first wife was alive, and pleaded in court that he did not know that she was living." The judge replied, "we have just had a case where we have been lenient to an unfortunate young man. And we think justly so. But there is no leniency to be given such a man as you. A man ought to know where his wife is. We sentence you to five years in the penitentiary." Judge Littlejohn was never diverted from the facts and the law in the case by the special pleading, sophistry or eloquence of the lawyers, but could unravel from the intricate web of the case its true history, and thus reach 4the most just and correct conclusions. There is a peculiar feature in the circuit court system. It is this: There are certain cases tried before the judge on the basis of law and testimony, justice and equity not being considered in trying them. Then the same judge sits in a court of chancery to try these other cases on the basis of justice and equity. Now, it seemed that Judge Littlejohn, whether sitting in the circuit court or in chancery, was always sitting as a judge in a court of equity. That is, in whatever court he was presiding, he always endeavored as we have said, to temper the severity of the law to the weakness of the criminal, with justice and equity, for he really put every man's case in equity, tried it slowly, got all the facts and clear evidence in the case, and held to them through all the conflict and arguments of the counsel on both sides. Instead of making law the stern, unfeeling, technical arbiter between man and man, he strove to make it the benevolent interpreter and guide through the mazes of the trial. An old member of the bar, noted for his bull dog tenacity in all his suits, had asked the judge to charge the jury so and so. The judge replied, "I decline, sir, to charge the jury as you request." Being still importuned by the lawyer to charge thus and thus, the judge, growing indignant at such persistent impertinence, turned to the lawyer, and, with a. manner and emphasis that would have made any other member of the bar quail, retorted, "I tell you, sir, that I decline to charge as you direct. It is not in accordance with the law and the facts in the case."

SKETCH ES-KALAMAZOO BAR.

SKETCHES OF SOME OF THE MEMBERS OF THE KALAMAZOO BAR, LIVING AND DEAD, NOT HERETOFORE GIVEN. I From the Kalamazoo Telegraph.] S. A. ATLEE. S. A. AtLee was a member of the district land office staff, secretary of state, and a gentleman of much political, social and literary distinction in the early days. He left here in 1843 for Washington. A few years since he presented to the ladies' library a very valuable autograph album which he had been years in making up, and which his intimate and very extensive acquaintance with public men of this and other nations, gave him remarkable opportunities to collect. At one time the name of S. Yorke AtLee was a household word in this part of the state and indeed in the state of Michigan. He never was an active member of the bar. WM. G. AUSTIN. Win. G. Austin was county clerk, and died in Nov., 1845; a young man of great promise and universally esteemed. WALTER 0. BALCH. Walter 0. Balch, son of N. A. Balch, died a young man, failing health preventing him from attaining any decided position at the bar, but he gave promise of distinction. His beautiful character and literary abilities made him loved by all who knew him. He was for a time associated with his father in the practice of law. J. W. 'BREESE. J. W. Breese, now in the 40th year of his continuous practice of the law, is yet, as he has been from the first, a leading member of the bar and has a lucrative practice. He has twice been president of the village and was an able and most efficient executive, always devoted to the best interests of the town. He is a gentleman whom all respect and esteem. SAAMUEL CLARK. Samuel Clark was a distinguished member of this bar. He was born in Cayuga county, N. Y., in January, 1800. He graduated at Hamilton College, and read law with Judge Hurlburt of Auburn, commencing practice in Waterloo, N. Y., in 1828. In 1833 he was elected to Congress, and after serving one term he resumed the practice of law. He removed to this place

in 1842 and soon took high rank as one of the leading lawyers of the state. He' was elected a member of the constitutional convention of Michigan, and was prominent in the more important topics in that body (says Judge Wells, who was a fellow member). He favored, by strong argument, the establishment of an independent supreme court, releasing its judges from circuit court duties. He was elected to Congress in 1853 and was recognized as one of the leaders of the Michigan delegation. Old citizens will remember his ability as a lawyer, his generous hospitality at his home, and his valuable services to his country in every public position he held and his private worth. HORACE H. COMSTOCK. * Horace H. Comstock was not so much noted as a lawyer as he was for many other qualities which made him a man of mark and of usefulness in pioneer times. The township and the village is named in honor of him. He removed from this place.in 1848 to Otsego. From having once been one of the largest of land holders here and one of the leading citizens of this county and state, he died in 1860 in New York a poor man. LYMAN I. DANIELS. Lyman I. Daniels located in Schoolcraft in 1831, and was the first lawyer in the county. In 1832, at the time of the Black Hawk scare, he was appointed, or acted, as colonel, and was ever afterward honored with that title. His law business was mostly in land matters and as agent of eastern purchasers. Colonel Daniels' portrait is in Cooley's picture of the first court in Kalamazoo county. He died in Cassville, Wis., in 1838. WM. H. DEYOE. Win. H. DeYoe was one of the most successful of the younger class of lawyers here. He was an excellent business attorney and very popular. He was very prominent in political and social circles. He was postmaster in 1856 and served four years to the satisfaction of all. His law business was all the time growing and he devoted a great deal of time to it. His health failed and he died on the cars just east of Lockport on his way home, in November, 1863, aged 42 years and 6 months. JOHN HASCALL. John Hascall studied law in Genesee county, N. Y., served in the war of 1812, and came to this county in 1830. He 'was an anti Masonic leader before he came west and was a strong mind among the people in the early "* See vol. 6, Page 859.

days here. He died here in 1853. His son Volney, the well known editor of the Gazette for years, studied law with Mr. Belcher and was admitted but gave little attention to practice.

He was, too, one of the leading farmers of Kalamazoo county. He died in 1854. DAVID HUBBARD. David Hubbard was another of the young lawyers who gave excellent promise of eminence at the bar. After admission he located at Schooloraft. He served in the Mexican war under Col. Curtenius. He resumed "practice after the war but failing health, caused by his war service, compelled him to abandon his profession. He died in Kalamazoo in 1852, deeply regretted by a multitude of friends. CHARLES B. HAYDEN. Charles B. Hayden studied law with Stuart & Miller and was regarded at the time as the most promising student in the place. He early enlisted in the war and speedily reached the rank of lieutenant colonel. He died at Cincinnati, universally mourned in his regiment and by all who knew him. JAMES H. KINNANE. Mr. Kinnare became a member of the Michigan bar on March 17, 1883, and began practice in Kalamazoo in April, 1884. He is a rising young lawyer. JAMES H. KNIGHT. James H.

He suffered for years from disease contracted in his army life. His record as an officer was a very fine one. In his death the people felt they had lost a most valuable citizen.

Squire Miller, father of Joseph, Jr., and James Miller, and of Hon. E. R. Miller, who still lives at Richland, was an excellent lawyer, one of the gentlemen of the old school. He was admitted to the bar before Judge Fletcher, but did not practice. * See vol. 7, page 481. tSee vol. 4, page 285.

Orig'l-Drake 12th Dupl'te-Cockatrice 14th 2he Right Honble Thomas Townshend (No 20) SIR, I have to add to my Letter by the Convoy wherein I mentioned, the Conduct of Lieut Gov'r Sinclair, that the Bills drawn by him in favor of Mr. McBeath, of which a considerable part, is for Merchandise, purchased, contrary, to my orders, have been protected, I do myself the Honor to Transmit to yoa, a copy of the Letter, I have written to the Secretary, of the Treasury, for the Information of their Lordships. Lieut. Governor Sinclair, not only disobeyed 'my orders, prohibiting the Purchase, of Merchandise, but in answer to one of my Letters complaining of the very Great Expense, incurred at the Post, where he commanded, he acquainted me, that a very Great Part, of it was for Presents, given to the Indians, by Traders, in their Wintering grounds not authorized, by him.It is to be regretted, that he did not give me that information previous to my accepting & Paying Bills of Exchange, in which these unjustizyable, Charges, were, Comprehended;-from this & his other proceedings, I conceived, my indispensible duty, to recall him, I flatter myself, that the King's Ministers, must be convinced of my attention to Diminish the Public Expense, the whole tenor of my conduct, and Correspondence, must evince itThe authorising the Remitters Agent, to give Credit, for Bills of Exchange, was in me the Effect of necessity, not of choice, and was occasioned, by the delay, of sending out Species, tho' repeatedly requested, in my Letters.I have now to acquaint you Sir, that a Spirit of Monopoly, pervaded, this Province, a Combination has been made & Succeeded, in Engrossing, into a few hands, the Rum, Brandy & other Spirituous, Liquors, which have been

Depy Agent for Indian Affairs-I am'also in hopes the Sloop will bring an assortment of Indian presents, having been too long without the necessary articles to answer the demands of the Indians, resorting to this Post. You will see Sir, How determined the Virginuians are to destroy the Indians who have our promise of support, now therefore to manage this matter without a strong reinforcement of Troops, and a supply of Indian Goods, is beyond my comprehension. -For the present the season is too far advanced for me to pretend to take any essential steps to support the Indians. -The Detachment of Rangers under Capt. Caldwell (who is himself indisposed) can scarce turn out six and thirty men fit for service; and the King's Regiment, the most excellent soldiers, are not altogether calculated, nor properly equipped for a Winter's campaign in the Indian country, exclusive that the five companies are absolutely necessary for the works and duty of this important post-Light troops are therefore what we want, and believe me there will be amusement for a good number of them the ensuing campaign without acting on the offensive. You desire to be informed of my Ideas on the method of stablishing a correspondence during the winter season-I have to inform you, that during my command at the upper Posts, I have frequently found it necessary to send 41

Col. Butler and Mr. Dease are quite au fait, of those matters. I shall soon send of the letters for Michilimackinac, and not fail to put Captain Robertson in the way of it.

The advanced season, and the sickness which prevails amongst the few Rangers at this Post, prevents my doing any thing Essential for the relief of the Indian Villages, it is therefore to be hoped that when the Enemy have done all the mischief possible they will retire. I must beg to repeat What I have formerly said, that I have and ever shall pay the strictest attention to a proper occonomy of the public money, and I can safely assert that I have saved Government ten thousand pounds at least, notwithstanding which, unless befriended by your Excellency I see I shall be liable to refund the perquisites at this Post, which have ever been looked upon by my predecessors as their due-I have therefore looked upon the Lots et Vents as my perquisite and have lived up to them in support of the dignity of a british commandant.

The Indian goods are not yet arrived nor do I expect them this fall-a dismal prospect-It however gives me great satisfaction to hear that your Excelly proposes sending your decisive orders, and instructions for the ensuing Campaign, which I hope to receive during the course of the Winter, in the mean time I shall not fail to exert my poor abilitys to the utmost.

DEAR SIR, I am just favour'd with your Letter of the 15th Inst., and am very sorry to hear that the Shawanese of the Standing Stone Village have kept so bad a look out-had they attended to your advice as the other Villages have done, it would not have happen'd and I should have been appraised of the Enemy being on their March in time to have sent assistance, the want of which information made me conclude that the Enemy had given over thoughts of an Expedition thisfall, and in Compliance with repeated Orders from the Commanding Officer of the District, I sent Captn. Bradts Detachment to Niagara. Oapt. Caldwell is himself very weakly and his Detachment of 70 men cannot turn out above half the number for Service, owing to the sickness they contracted at Sandusky, so that it is not in my power to send a force sufficient at this advance season to be of aid to my Children, who must necessarily avoid the Enemy if they prove too strong in numbers to cope

with, and this they may early do as they are acquainted with their being in their Country-It would therefore be imprudent in me to sacrifice those few Troops which may be of use to them in the Spring. The Enemy no doubt have left the Indian Country before this reaches you. I have nevertheless sent the Strings of Wampum as desired to the several Lake Indians, but they too, I fear are too much dispersed. Should the Enemy contrary to my expectations fortify themselves with an Intention of remaining in the Indian Country, I shall proceed to take such steps as will enable the Indians to dislodge them early in the Spring. Brigadr Genl McLean commands the District, he acquaints me that the orders relative to act in the defensive only, are still in force-I herewith inclose you an extract from the Commander in Chief's Letter which will inform you of his sentiments and of what we have to expect. We have nothing else worth communicating than that the Indian Presents have passed Niagara, but I fear we shall not see them till Spring. I hope soon to have the pleasure of your Company at Detroit, for should this Body of the Enemy have retreated, none other can be expected this Winter.

Delivers three Strings Fatherl We have received a message last summer, through you, from, the Commander in Chief, forbidding us to treat our Prisoners with cruelty, assuring us that it was contrary to the laws of God and custom of nations-which speech I have accepted and shall preserve. You will however recollect that we have injuries to revenge and altho' you protect the Entemy from the stake, you shall not from their Death, for the Warriours are determined not to spare them in battle, therefore Father be not surprized at seeing in future more Scalps than PrisonersFather! After having remined you of your promises and done your will I must inform you, that we and the other nations were much surprized to see people return from you to our Village unprovided, owing to the want of wherewith to supply them, as you told them you had not the things which they wanted. I beg of you Father not to use the same discourse to us, that you want certain things, but that you will provide not only for those who have accompanied me hither, but for those also who we have left behind to guard our village. Father! I, and my people expect that you will give us necessaries in abundance, as also, such ornaments which is acceptable and pleasing to young men, if otherwise we shall imagine, you do not speak from the Heart. Father! You cannot be ignorant that we are always engaged with an Enemy, or, on the watch at our Villageshe then speaks on two Strings Father I You may recollect that the last time I was here, I lost a Prisoner,

which you promised to see returned as he was adopted among us, I am therefore surprised that you have not yet satisfied me on that subject, as it does not correspond with your promise, I find by experience from my knowledge of mankind that from the late alteration you only speak from the mouth. Father I I pray of you to consider that my loss is great with respect to the prisoner, if ever you have been in my situation judge from your feelings if I have not reason to regret his lossFather! Before I finish my discourse I must repeat to you again to use our Warriours well, in supplying them with such things as they require, if not, what effect will my advice have upon them to enforce what you may directFather I You ordered two Barrals of Powder to be given out to us at St. Dooskey of which we have received but a'small part, we therefore hope that you will order it to be delivered to us at present exclusive of our proportion which we are to haveMajor De Peyster then answeredCOlildren of the Six Nations who Inhabit the Sh7awanese Country. Listen to the answer which I shall make to your speech-When the Governor of this Place first engaged you to take the part of your English Father he looked upon it as best for your mutual interest, on my arrival here I saw the necessity of your continuing to act on the side you where engaged, without which you must have been overpowered before now-you cannot deny but that I have ever fulfilled his promises as far as circumstances would admit-You that have so great a knowledge of humankind must also be capable to make allowances for accidents-the ship which was loaded with the Goods for Indian presents was taken at sea and as often re-taken by us, she at length arrived at Quebec but it was so late in the year, that the goods could not get up the country in time they are arrived at Niagara and I look for them every day, as soon as I get them you may expect to receive a proportion of such articles as the Commander in Chief has thought proper to send for his Indian Children but should you grow impatient before the things reach me and wish to go home, you must be content with such things only as I have to give you-with respect to the two Barrals of Gun Powder which you desire to have over and above, I must observe to you that I do not mean the Powder as a reward for your services but to enable you to defend your selves against the Enemy and to hunt, the time which that Powder should have been expended is past, since which 1 have repeatedly send powder in great quantitys and make no doubt but that you have received your share thereofChildren I Consider that we are to act for our mutual interest, if you push

With regard to the message which I forwarded to you, desiring you to treat all Prisoners with humanity, you must recollect that it's a language I have upon all occasions held out to you, and let me repeat that it is greatly your Interest to do so. If Captain Pipe had not put that Colonel to death after he had made him Prisoner, the Enemy would not have made an attack upon the Indian Country this year, for from every Intelligence which I receive they intimate it was only to revenge his Death. Children! I have another Message from the Commander in Chief to you which is "that you will not push the War into the Enemies Country but defend your own, in which he is ready to give you every assistance in his power(Delivers several Strings) Children! You tell me that I only speak from my mouth and not from the heart as I did not return the adopted Prisoner agreeable to promise-believe me Child'n that I speak so much from the heart that I remember well what I said to you, which was "if I could find the Prisoner that I should return him to you, I repeat the same to you still and I have so much feeling that I shall provide for the person to whom he was related. I have nothing more to say, but to desire Mr Baby to treat you as well as he can at present with such things as is in store(Copied from the Minutes) J. SCHIEFFELIN Secry.

MAJOR DE PEYSTER TO GENERAL HALDIMANID. DETROIT the 7th Jany 1783 SIR, My last letter informed your Excellency that the people from Kentuck6, had advanced as far as the standing stone-I now have the pleasure to acquaint you that they recrossed the Ohio without doing other mischief, than burning the Chillicotheko Village, a Traders house and Packs, and killing Ten Indians. Their sudden retreat I imagine was owing to their having received accounts that Irwin's Army was not to Join them, My Scouts from Fort Pitt bring Intelligence that the Enemy assembled there were dispersed by order of Congress. I shall still continue to prevent as much as possible, Incursions into the Enemys Country. Lieut. Du Quindre is gone off to stop the Ottawas of Michilimackinac, who Winter at the Grand River and are intent upon revenging the death of their young warriors. The Indian Goods are not arrived, nor, are the most troublesome of the Indians, whom I hear are determined to visit me, notwithstanding the repeated messages I have sent them to endeavour to prevent their coming. Some of the chiefs fear that they will be abandoned to the Mercy of the Enemy, They say that they are convinced I have full authority to speak to them, but that they nevertheless would be glad to hehr immediately from their Father at Quebec-I have prevented their going down the Country, as it would be attended with Inconveniency, and have promised that they shall hear from your Excellency by the first Vessels. Agreeable to your Excellency's wishes, I have ordered a Considerable reduction in the list of people imployed in the Indian Department, which shall be still more reduced when Mr McKee arrives. I have also reduced the list of artifficers &c and shall therefore send the Prisoners who were imployed by the Engineer, down early in the Spring. Mr. Rocheblave, I hear is gone to the Illinois, and as according tho' the memorandum left by him from the 20th October 79 to the 20th April 1782 amounting to ~500-exclusive of what is since due, I should be glad to have Your Excellency's orders how to act in case he should return to Detroit, or draw upon Messrs Macomb and Co, for the same.

You have heard the Substance of the Speech which I had to deliver and as I find since my arrival here that the report is not true, I expect that you will give me an account of your loss that I may inform my people on my return. The Snake acquaints the Seneca he cannot make him any answer to his Speech as he has not heard the resolution of the Shawanese but he will inform him of what had passed after which he made no doubt but the Chiefs would make their answer and forward it to them when convenient. Major De Peyster then says, Children! the Shawanese and DelawaresYou have heard what your Brethern the Six Nations have had to say to you, as they came here with the Express from Niagara and must return immediately, I shall say a few words to you in their presence by them I have received letters from the Commander in Chief, and the officer who commands at Niagara, the latter is much surprised to hear that you would allow an Enemy to surprize you in your own Country without you knowing of their approach, he tells me he is ready to give us assistance whenever I should require any, and wishes us to be strong, not to be discouraged but keep a good look out that you be no more taken by surprize-he says that the Six Nations have had all their Villages taken by the Enemy, yet they are strong, but now that we are all in arms it is impossible that the Enemy cut off any of our Villages while we are on our guardChildrenl Upon the reports sent to me before this last, I wrote to the Commander in Chief who has sent the 34th Regiment, part of which was to come here with the Indian Goods last Fall, but The season would not admit their crossing Lake Erie,-this I tell you in the hearing of the Six Nation Indians as they have seen themChildren! I repeat to you again that the only way of maintaining our'Villages is to do as the Great man advises us, which is to keep close to each other and be strong, for by dividing ourselves we lessen our strength-this is all I shall say to you until I see your people in greater numbers at which time I shall speak more fullyCopy from the Minutes J.

Hearing that the Wyandotts are desirous of going to war, I dispatch Ens'n McDougal to endeavor to stop them in case you should be on your way here, and he miss of you. I now have the pleasure to acquaint you that two Companies of the 34th Reg't and I hope more Rangers will be here in the Spring. They did embark with the Indian Goods, but were put back by the Westerly Winds. The whole of the 34th Reg't winter at Niagara, Fort Schlosser, & Fort Erie. I am persuaded Sir, that you have sent out proper Scouts with injunctions not to commit Depredations, agreeable to the Commander in Chief's Orders, and I may hope to see you when these scouts return provided it is altogether convenient to you. If on the contrary you do not propose visiting Detroit this winter, I should be glad of a few lines from you soon, in order that I may continue my Correspondence with the Commander in Chief, who desires thiL Expresses may keep constantly going between Detroit & Quebec all Winter.

From what I have seen of the Indians Hereabouts, I think of diminishing their ordinary presents to His Excellency's satisfaction, without incurring their Dislike to our Interest, provided they are not called to War. The Ottawas are the only Nations to be principally attended to, as to the Western Indians I hope there will be no question of them at this Post, most certainly, after this year, as I mean to take every precaution to prevent itI shall have every material for completing the Fort ready very early in the SpringIn case of any change or addition to this Garrison I should be glad His

Excellency would be pleased to order my Company here as I am best acquainted with themI am with much esteem Sir, Your most obedt Humble Servant DANL. ROBERTSoN, Captain 84th Regt Captain Mathews [B 98 p 192] GENERAL HALDIMAND TO MAJOR DE PEYSTER. H. Qr QUEBEC Feby. 14, 1783 M. do Peyster SIR, On the 7th Deer last I received your letter of the 29th Novr. covering one from Mr. McKee, reporting to you the destruction of a Shawenese Village by the Virginians, & their having taken Post there with a View to future Incursions-An Express arrived a few days ago from Niagara, but as there were no accounts from Detroit, I persuade myself that the Enemy retired as you conjectured they would, and that the Indians have been since undisturbed. Letters from B. Genl. Maclean accompanied by a Speech from the Six Nations are strongly expressive of their desire, & Intention to' retaliate upon the Enemy, the last unexpected Stroke at Standing stone Village and demanding my assistance therein, which I find they have communicated & recommended to the Indians in Your Quarter-Nothing can be more natural than this desire Yet under the express orders I have received & communicated to the different Posts, it is impossible I can comply with their Request, on the contrary, it becomes our duty to use every possible means to dissuade them from their purpose-At the same time upon the Principal of Defence you may assure them that altho' I cannot assist, or approve of their carrying war into the Enemy's Country, I shall afford them every aid in my Power to secure & defend their own against every Incursion of the Enemy-Having desired B. Genl. Maclean to transmit to you the Substance of my answer to the Six Nations (which is as full and satisfactory as my circumstances will admit) it would only be Repitition to enlarge hero.upon the Subject-You will take the Sense of it in whatever you may have occasion to say to the Indians, as well upon the Subject of Presents as of WarI am pleased to find you have made Reductions in the enormous List of, appointments in the Branch of the I. Department, at Detroit-I hope in a short Time a general Reform will take place, having prepared Instructions & Regulations for that Purpose which are now under Consideration

Page 343
PERQUISITES. 343 It will always give me Pleasure to serve officers under my command as far as it lyes in my Power, who have distinguished Themselves by their Zeal and attention to the King's Service, but the disposal of the Lots et Vents at Detroit, no more depend upon my Decision than those in the lower part of the Province, and my orders from Howe upon that Subject are very particular-Indeed there cannot be a Reason why they should be appropriated to private Purposes in on Part of the Province and to the Public in another & The command Money at the Posts is intended for the Purpose of defraying extraordinary Expenses attending them, and is all that, in the Military Line, can be expected-I can only say that in this matter, You are in the same Predicament, not only with your Predecessors, but with the Lt. Governor for Six Years backI am &c (signed) F. H. Endorsed:-No 18 1783 To Major De Peyster Commanding at Detroit of 14 february Ent'd B no 2 fol 28 [B 123 p 362]

CAPTAIN LANGLADE TO CAPTAIN ROBERTSON. LA BAYE the 5th March 1783 GOVERNOR, This letter is to assuye you of my very humble respects and to inform you that according to the r6port brought by some Puants when the Traders passed at the Portages of Ouis-consin their nation wished to rob them, that in the tumult there was a Puant, called Boeuf Blanc killed and that, to revenge themselves they took from Mr. Reilh five or six packets as well of liquor as other things and as they were still drunk when Mr Blondeau passed be also was obliged to give them plunder to save his life. There were forty Sauteaux, men, women and children who were eating each other because of the famine in La Baye des N6ques; Caron Chief of the Folles-Avoines died the 3rd of November, and one named Marcotte a Trader was killed it is not known whether by the Sauteaux or the Scioux but that three men escaped although two were wounded. I hope soon to have the honor of going to tender you my respects and if you have still need of my services command me when you please, you will find me always ready to receive your orders for I am always with the greatest respect, Governor the faithful servant of the King LANGLADE Captain of the Indian Department Addressed:-To Captain Robertson Governor of Michilimackinac at Michilimackinao Endorsod:-1783 Letter from Captain Langlado to Captain Robertson La Baye 5th March.

INTENTIONS OF THE ENEMY. / 351 Indians from seeking Revenge they seem bent upon, by penetrating so far as they must now do into the Country-In all events I depend upon your exertions to prevent it, that no Blame may fall at our Door, should obstacles occur to the Accomodation so anxiously desired-I recommend'd to You so strongly in my last letter the necessity for keeping out Intelligent Scouts towards Fort Pitt, and as far as possible into the Enemies Country to gain an early knlowledge of their Intentions in the Spring, that is unnecessary for me to enlarge upon it here, from their perseverance last campaign, and an attempt lately made to posess themselves of Oswego, there is every reason to suppose they will employ every Effort to extend as far as possible their Frontiers in the Upper Country, to secure in case of a peace, some valuable Settlements, & to get the Firr Trade into their hands. These Exertions will naturally be made as early as possible, and will require the utmost Vigilance on our parts to discover and counteract. You did perfectly right to Prevent any of the Chiefs from coming down here, as it would be attended with much Expense, And answer no good purpose-with my last Letter you would receive the Substance of my answer to the Six Nations, upon the same subject, having directed Brigadier Maclean to transmit it to you to make such use of it with your Indians as you should think fit. I am glad to find you have made a Reduction in the list of persons employed in the Indian Department at Detroit, I wish you had specified them, as it might have been' useful in the arrangement of that Branch, which with others will soon take place. Please by the first opportunity to transmit to me a return of that Department Specifying the appointments you have discontinued from what Time, the Stations and Services performed by those officers remaining. Mr. Rochblave has from Time to Time received Money here, on account of his Salary it is therefore unnecessary than any account should be opened with him at Detroit as he will continue to receive his allowance here.

CAPTAIN ROBERTSON TO SECRETARY MATTHEWS. MICHILIMACKINAO 20th April 1783. SIR, You will be pleased to inform His Excellency the Commander in Chief that I have the Honor to draw on him, in favour of Mr. Geo. McBeath; Three Thousand, one Hundred, forty six Pounds fourteen shillings & seven pence, New York Currency, on account of the Engineer Department, and Two Hundred and Ten Pounds same Curry. on account of the Indian Department, both from the first of January to the 1st of April inst. as by Vouchers annexed, which I hope will be satisfactory as I have exerted myself to the utmost to decrease the Expenses in every Line. The saving in Provisions will appear by the Commissary's Returns. Herewith a Return of Indian Presents since last Fall. The old Guard House which I converted into a Barrack for Two officers was accidentally burned by Sparks falling on the Roofs of Bark. Mr. McBeath requests His Excellency will be pleased to grant His Pass as usuall. Lieut. Clowes leaves this to-morrow in a light Canoe well manned, he will inform His Excellency of what has been done during the Winter &c. I have sent you Two Letters all the news I have had this winter. Mr. McBeath setts out this week for La Prairie de Chiens with Mr. Langlade Junr in order to dissuade the Western Indians, who assemble there, from coming this length. I have the Honour to be with regard, Sir, your most obedt. & most humble Servant, DANL. ROBERTSON Captain Mathews. Captn. 84th Regt. [B 98 p 199] CAPTAIN ROBERTSON TO CAPTAIN BREHM.

DEAR SIR, This Climate is preferable to any part of Canada, I have been at, and of course very healthyThe soil is gravelly and very thin here, but from I have seen of the Produce in Wheat, Pease and Barley Farming may answer, I think in a very short time there may be Pease for the Garrison, & Oats for the Horses. No Oats nor Buck wheat here, I have sent for both to Detroit for seed. There

AFFAIRS AT MICHILIMACKINAC. 359 will be good Gardening with some Trouble, A Bad Kind of Grass, very good pasture for sheep, Grass seeds much wanted, likewise Clover. Trade is not carried on here to my Ideas, nor to the General Satisfaction of the Traders, the Posts are not half supplyed with Goods and the principall given to Individuals only, which cause discontent & room to ask among the Indians as likewise an excuse to come so often to this place. Now, Sir, I mean to oblige every Wintering Trader to give Security for his good behaviour, his properly supplying the Indians & his keeping to the place allotted him by his Pass. This I think will keep the Indian to his Hunting, for they are all fond of seeing a quantity of Goods. Liquor is their Ruin. This is, as yet, an expensive place andas I am determined by every/ means possible to decrease the Government Expenses, I hope His Excellency] will take my own situation into His considerationAt a proper time you will be pleased to lay these hints before His Excellency for His consideration and my future conduct how to act. I mean to send the first Vessel from Detroit to St. Joseph's, & the Grand River, if not instructed to the contrary, for a Load of Corn, as the extra price on it is owing to the Transporting hither in Boats by the Traders. There is a Mr. Moumbourne Bouch6, a Canadian in the Mississippi with a Gang of Moroders, whom annoy the Traders very much, by exactinlg Goods &c. He is Commissioned by the SpaniardsThere were a number of Engaged Canadians prepared to desert from hence, of which I had Intelligence & prevented, I have taken some precautions for the future, as those Rascals mean to Join Mr. Bouch6. I am like told that I may expect some Gentry from the Spanish Quarter this summer, who were here last year. I believe they should be 'sent down the Country for His Excellency's Examination, if I am not in time otherwise instructed.

The Kings Speech which was copied from a Pensylvania news Paper lately brought to Oswego gives us the greatest reason to hope for accounts by the first vessel from Niagara of the preliminary being signedIt therefore behoves us to do our utmost endeavours to restrain the Indians by assuring that should they persist to act, contrary to the intentions of their British Father we cannot support them, but on the contrary if they remain quiet, should the Enemy in the mean time enter their Country, we will give them every assistance in our power. The annexed Copy of a Letter from His Excellency the Commander in Chief fully explains his intentions of restraining the Indians, it will therefore be needless for me to enlarge upon the Subject to one so fully acquainted with Indian Affairs as you are. As your endeavours to redeem the prisoners out of the hands of the Indians were in a great degree baffled by the late incursions of the Enemy to the Standing Stone-You may perhaps on the present occasion be able to mention it with better success in Council-I will speak with you more fully on this subject when I have the pleasure of seeing you before you set out upon your Journey.

Indians are well disposed to follow such instructions as they may from time to time receive, and your Excellency may be assured that the Virginians will be the first to break the truce. I doubt not however, that I shall find some difficulty to restrain the Wabash Indians, but nothing shall be neglected that may in any wise contribute to bring it about. I have indulged them with a trader, in order to induce them to stay at home and follow their hunting-It will -also prevent so great a run upon the Kings store. Messrs Le Grand and Cournoyer, arrived here lately from Post Vincennes,. which place they left quiet and the people desirous of forgiveness for their past missconduct. As those two gentlemen are know Loyalists, and are to return and settle at Detroit, with their families, I have permitted them to take a few goods to enable them to cloathe their families, and settle their affairs. The annexed copy of a speech was delivered to me whilst in council with the chiefs, as the courrier was acquainted with the contents and had it verbally to deliver, I communicated it to them; and advised them not to move 'till we should hear of the Enemy being on their march, which was agreed to.

DETROIT 20th May 1783 SIR, In compliance with your Excellency's Commands I herewith inclose a List of the Indian Officers, Volunteers, &c, whereby it will appear how many have been struck off at different times since October last those which will remain after the 24 Inst. are indispensibly necessary, and they are most of them actually employed restraining the different Nations. The high Pay which appeared given to four of the Volunteers could not bo avoided, since which one of them has been struck off, and two others have been reduced to on Dollar pr. Day. I have order'd all the Public Works to cease, have paid the officers to the 24th Inst. as they have still some matters to arrange. I have drawn upon your Excellency for the Expenditures of this Post in the usual manner and all Expenditures for the Indian Department after the 24th Inst. shall be drawn for agreable to the Instructions which have just come to hand. Mr Cleavcourt has deliver'd his charge of Presents in very bad order, as, many of the Bale Goods are rotten. I shall proceed to discharge our Debts to the Merchants with the best of them, and cause the small portion left to be deliver'd to the Indians. I have stopped half the Bale Goods directed to Michilimackinac until I hear if more are upon the Road for this Post.

of the United States, & that it is very doubtful whether the Hurons will be prevailed upon to allow white people to settle upon the other side of the River-I will consider myself as peculiarly fortunate if I can by the command with which I am honored, be instrumental in alleviating the Distresses, & in procuring the means of subsistence for men who have been deprived of everything on account of their* Loyalty to the King and adherence to the constitution of their Country. I no sooner ordered His Majesty's Proclamation for a cessation of Hostilities to be published than I caused Messrs Hay & Du Calvert & others whom the Exigencies of the state had obliged me to keep in confinement to be released, I am happy to find that His Majesty has adopted my idea that these men & others under the same Predicament, ought not to be released, but from a persusion in the Governor that their enlargement would not be detrimental to the Public Tranquility His Majesty may be assured that my grateful Efforts will be exerted to procure the good opinion & confidence which he has in my zeal for his service & attachment to the Welfare of. his people. An easy and safe communication between this Country & Nova Scotia becomes at the time a necessary consideration of Government, as well for commercial purposes as for mutual security-I- have therefore ordered the Grand Voyer & Deputy Surveyor General to trace a road from this country to Lake Temisquala, which empties itself into the River St John's. I hope His Majesty Governor of Nova Scotia will take the same steps within his Government. I prepare this Dispatch without [waiting?] for orders & Directions from Your Lordship, as I wish you to be informed of the state of things with regard to the Indians, as I am very anxious to give the Lords Commissioners of His Majesty's Treasury information of the money matter within the Province & of the Difficulties in which Mr. Cochrane the Agent for the Remitters of Public Money to the amount of no less a sum than ~134,000 & upwards, to be employed in the Mercantile Speculation of Messrs Shaw & Fraser.

OBSERVATION OF THE TRUCE. 367 Fort Nelson-As the business the Flag is sent upon relates solely to the Indians they- may in this last act as they think best-If they are informed of the number of their People at the Falls, and chuse to send Virginians to exchange for them, it will answer the good end of convincing, the People of Kentucke of their good dispositions to observe the Truce so earnestly recommended. For my part not having any power to treat for the exchange of Prisoners I can not with propriety let any go from hence, but on the contrary I would strongly advice them not to attempt to pass the Indian Country till matters are finally settled, least notwithstanding the present pacifick dsipositions some evil ill designing Persons amongst them might do the prisoners an ill turn for which we would be made answerable. Most of the Prisoners brought to Detroit to the amount of four hundred, ninety two are at their own request gone down to Montreal in hopes of getting home by way of Lake Champlain, amongst the few that remain here is Mrs. Poeke and all her little Family, to whom every mark of attention due to the unfortunate is shown, she writes to her husband by this opportunity. I flatter myself Sir, that you will seize so favourable a Conveyance to assure Major Walls & the People of Kentucke that nothing has been wanting on our part to stop the Indians from committing further Depradations on the Frontiers therefore should a small party escape from the remote part of the Wabash or eles where unknown to us it would be the height of imprudence in them to retaliate otherwise than upon the party who are the immediate aggressors, in which case we may soon to have to see matters restored to tranquility to the satisfaction of all Parties-I have not received any other accounts from His Excellency the Commander in Chief than a Copy of the King's Proclamation and a repetition of those Injunctions to restrain the Indians. The reason of his not writing lately must be owing to his wanting the arrival of a ship from England when I hope he will acquaint us with matters being finally concluded, and then you and I may sit ourselves upon our Matt with the pleasing reflection of having redeemed many of the unfortunate from Slavery, and saved the Lives of those who (if they have the least Spark of Gratitude) will hereafter bless usI have the honour to be with the utmost esteem Dear Sir Your most humble & most obedt Servant AT.

The Indians very properly think there are no more than one God at each Post, and as Commandants are only to give what Goods they have from below, it can answer no good purpose, and how soon it takes place I will then beg to be taken from those Posts, as I never will sit in an Indian Councill where Agents preside, who perhaps, know less of those matters.than I doI was much hurt & concerned on hearing my Bills on Government, were not honoured, as I have exerted myself to the utmost to effect the purpose of, my coming here, and I do declare & can prove that the Expenses here are in Provisions &c. &c. fifty Thousand Pounds less than last year & much.more work done than ever-hitherto partly to my Ruin as my pay goes faster than it comes.

This is what they have done. Brothers, The Great Council of the United States, which we call Congress, have determined to treat all the Indian Nations as Brethren, and will appoint some wise persons to call upon each Nation, in order to make a new Chain of Friendship-Therefore I recommend to you, to call all the Chiefs of your Nations together, and consult with yourselves what will be most for your good to do- If I can be of any Service, send a Belt for me & I will come to your meeting.,~~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~,.~ '* ^;'.'-.:~i I ^

I still abide to the Tenor of my Letter to Colonel Hope of being relieved when an Indian Agent comes to this Post-and I flatter myself that His Excellency will consent to it, for if I am not equall to the Inspection of one Line I must be a mere Cypher here, which must be a great mortification to one at my time of Life, who came at a very great disadvantage to this Post, and arranged matters as they are, in appearance to the satisfaction of my Superiors. - The Vessell is completely finished and Launched, all to Rigging, which Captain Grant has refused to furnish for Reasons best known to him, andnot

And as a proof of their good disposition they have generally consented to deliver up the Prisoners and to adhere strictly in future to every thing that has been enjoined them in the name of their Father. Sindatton on behalf of the Hurons of Detroit made the only objection to the requisition of the Prisoners, asserting that when the Hatchet was put into his hands he was told that all the Prisoners they took during the War Should be kept to strengthen their nation and that this promise has been since, often confirmed by his Father at Detroit but in order to obviate the weight of this assertion the Indians were informed that on the conclusion of Peace every cause of uneasiness should be removed on all Sides to make it permanent and to this end it was the custom of all nations to Set the Prisoners at LibertyNotwithstanding the tractable temper of the Indians they are not without apprehensions of the designs of the Americans upon their country which by their Accounts they have just reason, for as partys are constantly on this Side of the Ohio marking the Country. Their Sentiments upon this Subject is fully express'd in what pass'd between them at a private council which is herewith enclosedThe Vessel having been prevented by contrary Winds 'till within this few days getting out of the River, the Six Nation Deputies earnestly requested to return in her, as the information they had received respecting their country was of great impcrtance and they wished to have it represented*as soon as possible.

SIR, I have received your letter of the 20th August-and, am sorry to hear that Mr. Ellice has troubled His Excellency the comm'r in Chief on the Subject of Mr. Cuyler's affair with Graverat, wherein he has so wrongfully accused me of injustice. Mr. Graverat came to a voluntary settlement by arbitrators, without one word from me, more, than to advise him to settle without delay, as he acknowledged he had wherewithall to satisfy all his creditors. Mr. Graverat some time after called at my house, to present Mr. Cuylor with three notes of hand payable at remote periods, which Mr. Cuyler complained of telling me that Graverat must have been Ill-advised, for that, instead of the notes, which meant nothing, he had promised to deliver him a Quantity of peltry, etc., on which I soon after sent for Mr. Graverat, and expostulated with him on the impropriety of his Conduct, telling him that If he did not give the satisfaction promised, he must go down the country to settle the matter there. I then sent for three Gentlemen of Character in the Mercantile line, and referred the matter to them, whether Mr. Graverat acted like a man of character or not. I left him to advise with those Gentlemen, and was told in a few Minutes, that he was convinced he had acted wrong, and begged Mr. Ouyler would call the next day at his hotse, when he would satisfy him, which was accordingly done. Now Sir, let me observe, that until I received His Excellencys letter dated April the 14th, Notwithstanding the repeated thanks I had received, both Public. and private, from the Fair trader for Services rendered them on Similar occasions. I had resolved not to interfere any more in matters of property-nor in the affair in Question have I acted contrary to the spirit of His Excellencys letter, which was "to afford every assistance in my power consistant with my a

If in having so done I am exposed to a prosecution, it is a Satisfaction to me, that it was not of my own seeking. The only circumstance which gives me Concern, is, least His Excellency should think me capable of making an improper use of Authority. If Mr. Cuyler has no right to the Payment, I have been deceived both by him an d Mr. Graverat. They must be answerable to Mr. Ellice. I am Sir your most Humble and most obedient Servant. AT. S.

They moved, manyihaving almost all the Property they had been for many years collecting to enable them to live comfortably, cheared with the prospects of having a fairer field for their Industry and a clearer and more permanent Right to whatever Improvements they should make for the future. Lands were given to the new Settlers, deeds were drawn out and executed, but given conditionally during the pleasure of His Majesty, or of the Governor of the Province of Quebec. To apply for a Confirmation of the Grants was promised them, and they doubt not it was their late worthy Lieutenant Governor's Intention. They flattered themselves it would have met with success. His Removal has put it out of his Power. At that Time the Conditionality of the Tenure by which they held did not much alarm them, convinced that while under a British Government their measures were too just to deprive their subjects of that strongest and most natural Right of occupancy supported by a Tenure, tho' perhaps not strictly conformable to the rules of Law, yet consonant to those of Equity. The present critical situation of Affairs but too justly alarms them with the near view of this Place of their Residence falling under another Government, which as formerly, a part of the British Empire, they hope will be actuated by the same generous motives, yet at the same Time they cannot reasonably expect the same Indulgence from. People in their Line of Life, especially the Merchantile cannot be supposed capable of settling their affairs in a short Time and leaving a place when it ceases to belong to the Goverment under which they would live by choice, and even those who could leave it on the shortest notice must wish to make the most of what Real or Personal Property they have there. Should those that are expected to govern here be inclinable to dispute the validity of your Petitioners Tenure they tremble at the consequences, as many of them must inevitably be ruined by such a Step their whole Property being Invested in what Improvements they have made in the Lands granted unto them as British Subjects. Under these alarming Circumstances Your Petitioners have taken the Liberty upon this occasion to request that you would be pleased to Interest yourself with His Excellency on their behalf for a confirmation of their Deeds on the Island, & they are fully convinced from the many proofs you have given since your Residence here of your desire to protect and promote the Trade of this Country, that every exertion will be made use of by you for that Purpose.

MISCELLANEOUS MATTERS.

CAPTAIN ROBERTSON TO GENERAL HALDIMAND. MICHILIMACKINAO 9th March 1784. SIR, My present situation and,the following Reasons will in some small degree apologize for presuming to trouble Your Excellency at this juncture, vizt. I entered the Service as Surgeon's Mate to the 42nd Regiment in April 1754, got an Ensigncy in August 1756 at Albany from the late Earl of London, and purchased a Lieutenancy at Martinico previous to the Havannah Expedition in April 1762, & was unfortunately reduced in 1763 when on Service under the late worthy General Bouquet. At the commencement of those Troubles I was appointed Major of the Montreal Militia, where I continued until the arrival of Brigadier McLean in June 1775, who was pleased to nominate me Captain Lieutenant in the Emigrants, and after enlisting about a Company I was ordered to St. John's, where I was taken Prisoner & kept so for fourteen months. I returned to my Regiment in 1777, & since your Excellency's arrival in Canada my different situations are well known to yourself. The disagreeable and particular manner I came to this Post induced me to act on the strickest principles of Honor, arid very painfull zeal to diminish expenses, and preventing the Indians from giving Presents &c., which deprived me of all the common-Emoluments of my Predecessors. These Reasons, will, I hope induce Your Excellency to take my case into consideration at this Critical Juncture. I have the Honor to be with every Respect & regard Sir Your excellency's most obed't & most humble Servant DAN'L ROBERTSON Capt. 84th Reg't His Excellency General Haldimand &c &c &c [B 98 p 244] OAPTAIN ROBERTSON TO SECRETARY MATTHEWS. MICHILInACKINAC, 9th March, 1784. SIR, I received your oblidging Letters, publick and private of the 5th of November last and return you my hearty thanks for every attention to me and mine.

I have wrote to His Excellency which you will be pleased to deliver at a proper time. I sent down the agreement between Mr. Foy and my son to Major Lernoult last fall, and long ago his name at the office, for a purchase, which I wish could be effected, even at a high price, where he would be but of the Break. I am nearly out of Indian goods and of opinion those People should be well treated on parting With them, but this of Course I refer to His Excellency. I have lost two of the Kings horses owing to the scarcity of Hay and corn by not having Boats as I mentioned to you formerly. I heartily- congratulate you on your justly merited Promotion, I have a nephew in the 53d Regiment, to whom I beg your countenance as far as he deserves itI have the honor to be with great Regard, Your most obedient and most humble Servant, DAnL. ROBERTSON. Major Mathews, etc. etc. FB 98 p 246] LIEUT. COL. DE PEYSTER TO GENERAL HALDIMAND. DETROIT 12th April, 1784. SIR, I am extremely sorry that I am prevented from repairing to Niagara so soon as I could wish. The Adjutant Genl. will inform your Excellency with the reason. I am once more obliged to 'trouble your Excellency with a Circumstance which gives me much uneasiness, least your Excellency should think I infringed the orders prohibiting officers purchasing Goods on account of Government. It was the Absolute act of necessity which obliged me to borrow a certain Quantity, and to give orders to a Trader residing at the Miamie to advance wherewith all to stop the Wabash and Miamie Indians, from coming to Detroit with their families at a time their visit would have been. very inconvenient, and, more expensive to Government, promising to send goods to replace them when they arrived from Canada. When the Goods were received in August I might have replaced them, but as Mr. Mc0ormick delivered a message from Sir John Johnson, requesting the bales might not be broken

RELATIVE TO CLAIMS AND DEEDS.

upon to repay the articles borrowed, I accordingly acquiesed-It however became necessary that I should close my accounts with the Indian department before I delivered it over to Mr. McKee we therefore agreed that I should draw upon Sir John for the amount whom we advised of every circumstance. He nevertheless refused payment, and has since ordered that the articles borrowed of Mr. Baby, and at the Miamie shall not be replaced. I must therefore beg your Excellency will not look upon the matter in question, in any other light than as goods borrowed at a time of absolute necessity, and still at the option of the Superintendent General to replace-which I most humbly submit to your Excellency's consideration in hopes you will give orders to have this matter finally settled, so that the Traders may not come upon me for payment.

SIR, As the rivers and Lakes will soon be clear of Ice and admit of my proceeding to Detroit, I beg to be honored with your Excellencys Instructions when I may depart from this: As also to be informd whether the claims of individuals upon Indian Lands there (that is to say those lying on the Strait between the Lakes Erie and Huron a great part of which I informd your Excellency was claimed) are to be looked upon as valid; and whether the Mode of acquiring them by what is call'd Deeds of Gift is to be encouraged or discountenanced. Your Excellency in conversation last October (I think it was) told me you Hoped and expected many setlers from Virginia and Maryland, would be induced to take up Lands at Detroit in order to free themselves from burdensome Taxes." I any should come with that dessign, are they to be encouraged or aided or in what manner am I to act with them or others, who may come there from any of the States with different Views.

I also beg your Excellency will inform me, what I am to look upon as an established presedent for demanding and collecting all dues, perquisites &c. &c. at DetroitI have the honor to be your Excellencys most obedient, and most humble servant, JEHU HAY. His Excellency General Haldimand Endorsed:-From A 1784 Lieut. Govr. Hay 19th April Rec'd 22d [B 123 p 440] GEN. HALDIMAND TO LIEUT. GOV. IAY. HEADQUARTERS QUEBEC, 26th April, 1784. SIR:-I have received your letter of the 19th inst., desiring instructions relative to your departure for Detroit. The ignorance in which I still remain respecting the measures to be adopted in the upper country, in consequence of the Definitive Treaty of Peace, leaves me nothing to, add to the instructions I gave you last fall; and though it is probable that I shall soon receive orders which might perhaps render your journey unnecessary, in the event of the Posts being evacuated, yet I am unwilling, upon that uncertainty, to prevent you from availing yourself of the most favorable season for the journey you have to take; you will therefore proceed to Detroit as soon as your convenience will permit. In answer to the other subjects of your letter, I have to acquaint you that the claims of individuals, without distinction, upon Indian Lands at Detroit, or any other part of the Province, are invalid, and the mode of acquiring lands by what is called Deeds of Gift, is to be entirely discountenanced, for by the King's Instructions, "no private Person, Society, Corporation, or Colony, is capable of acquiring any property in lands belonging to the Indians, either by purchase of, or grant of conveyance from the said Indians, excepting only where the lands lye within the limits of any colony, the soil of which has been vested in Proprietaries, or corporations only shall be capable of acquiring such property by purchase, or Grants from the Indians. It is also necessary to observe to you that by the King's instructions, no Purchase of Lands belonging to the Indians, whether in the name or for the use of the Crown, or in the name or for the use of Proprietaries of Colonies be made, but at some general meeting at which the Principal Chiefs of each

Tribe claiming a proportion in such lands are present; and all tracts so purchased must be regularly Surveyed by a Sworn Surveyor in the presence and with the assistance of a Persuon deputed by the Indians to attend such Survey, and the said Surveyor shall make an Accurate Map of such Tract, describing the Limits, which map shall be entered upon the Record with the deed of conveyance from the Indians. These instructions lay totally aside the claim of Mr. Scheifflin (which you will hear at Detroit) to an Indian Grant of Land even had he obtained it by less unworthy meaps* than He did. Some application to, or offer from the Indians at Detroit for Lands has been made in favor of the Officers and Interpreters who have served during the war with them-Should it be renewed on your arrival there you will please to communicate the circumstances to me, describing particularly the Tract of Land, the persons applying for it &c. and such part of the Transaction as may concern the Indians must, at the same time, to be reported to Sir John Johnson thro Mr. McKee, His Deputy at Detroit.In regard to persons from Virginia &c. Maryland who miy propose themselves as Settlers in the Neighbourhood of Detroit, great ttention must be paid not to receive any whose political characters will not bear e nicest Scrutiny, His Majesty's Instrutions for granting Lands, on the present occasion, positively, directing that none shall be permitted to settle in this Province but those of approved Loyalty, for which purpose it is directed that all persons who settle therein shall (besides the usual Oaths of Allegiance, &c.) make and Subscribe the following Declaration: " I, A B, do promise " and declare that I will maintain & defend to the utmost of my power the S"authority of the King and his Parliament as the Supreme Legislature of " this Province." Persons of the above description I shall have no objection to receive, and should any offer you will report to me their Characters, &c., Requests before you enter into any Engagements with them. Your last Query, " What you are to look upon as an Established precedent "for demanding & collecting all dues, Perquisites, &c., &c.," I am at a loss to understand. Quit Rents, and all dues whatever belonging to the Crown, must be regularly demanded, collected and accounted for to the Receiver General of the Province, as well in future as for six years back, for which the Lieutenant Governor, &c., several Commanding officers, must be accountable. In regard of Perquisites, I am ignorant of any accruing to the Crown, or to Lieutenant Governors in any part of this Province. I am, Sir, &c., (Signed) FRED, HALDIMAND. /o

MONTREAL, 29th April 1784, SIR: Yesterday I was honoured with your Excellency's Instructions of the 25 Instant, enclosing a Warrant for the Allowance of House rent, with an order and Recept for a Bell promised to the Hurons. As your Excellency is pleased to attend to my convenience, so far as to permit me to make my departure agreeable to myself, I shall remain here some days longer than would otherwise been necessary, tho' my being encumbered with a family consisting of twelve persons will not admit of great dispatch. Perhaps Vessels may arrive early with dispatches for your Excellency. The great and unavoidable Expences I have been put to being such as to have almost dissipated the small resource I Had left for their maintainance: obliges me to keep them as near me as possible, and I would wish to prevent both the Expence and trouble of taking them up and returning immediately; which it seems from your Excellency'sLetter will be the consequence-on the event of evacuating the posts taking place, which would put the finishing hand to my ruin without a recompense. For tho' I have not made much complaint, and tho' my Family was not even known to, or received the value of a ration of provision from Government during my absence of three years and a half (on the contrary paid even their passage from Carleton Island to this place) my Fortune Has not been better'd by Government: much less can I boast of having realized twenty five or thirty thousand pounds at the Expence of my Country: and can truly say If it should please God to put a short period to my life I should leave a numerous family in more distress than may be imagined. One reason for my having requested your Excellencys Instructions regarding Rights, dues and perquisites, is that by my commission I am appointed Lieut. Governor and Superintendant of Detroit to have and to Hold the same, with

all Rights, priviledges Profits, Perquisites, and advantages to the same belonging or appertaining: the meaning of which I may be a partial Judge of, being interested: which is a motive that frequently bias men, and sometimes even unknown to themselves. Be that as it may: in the present case I can not Help thinking, I am straightened both in power, and advantage, but shall nevertheless do all and the best I can for the good of His Majestys Service, by a strict attention to the orders I Have or may have the honor of receiving from your Excellency.

SIR, I am directed by His Excellency the Commander in Chief to acquaint you that he has received your Letter of the 29th Ultimo, containing the following passage, " much less can I boast of having realized Twenty-five thous"and pounds at the expcnce of my country."-As this, in no way relates to any part of His Excellencys Letter of the 25th, to which yours is in answer, and as it conveys an insinuation that some Individual within Your knowledge has benefited very considerably at the expence of the public. His Excellency considers it your Duty, as an officer of the Crown fully to explain that part of your Letter, & to communicate to Him, without reserve, the circumstances on which it is founded, Which he requires you will do by the first opportunity.I am &c.

LIEUT. GOV. HAY TO GENERAL HALDIMAND. MONTREAL 6th May 1784. SIR, Yesterday I favored with a Letter from Major Mathews acquainting me your Excellency "considers it my Duty as an officer of the Crown fully to explain the following passage in my Letter of the 29th Ultimo, Vizt: much less can I boast of having realized, twenty-five, or thirty thousand pounds at the expence of my country. That- passage together with what I mentioned before it in the same Letter, of having been put to heavy Expences, and my Family during my absence (at least from the summer 1779) not having received the least succour from Government, I should have thought would be understood as regarding myself, as having supported them without any particular advantage from the Crown. My saying that I am incapable of doing any one thing, can not in my weak opinion be construed as asserting that a second or third person can, or has done that thing. I beg leave to assure your Excellency if I come to a perfect unequivocal knowledge of any person having made an assertion, directly contrary to my own alluded to, I shall not make use of Instructions for your Excellency's information, but the plainest Terms I am capable of. I however hope (as I am not a correct penman and have nobody to write for me) Your Excellency will please to put the most favorable coustructions upon my Expressions or mistakes. And this leads me to request your Excellency will read, (straitened) instead of (straightened) which is a mistake I believe I made in my Letter of the 29th of last monthI.have the Honor to be Your Excellency's most obedient and most Humble Servant JEHU HAY.

going to War, wherein it was determined to cutt off this Place. How far this is true time must determine. However, I am on my Guard, and uncompleated and ill provided as the Fort is, they must give me a hearty Beating before they succeed. Those people have received every attention from me, but they were and are much disgusted at the Presents their Warriors received on their arrivall at Detroit, acquainting both the Commanding officers there and the District of it, and have forbid any Person here to write anything about the matter. I expect them from their Wintering Ground dayly, when I shall be better informed. On the breaking up of the Ice the Wharf here was broke to Pieces, so that no kind of Craft could be loaded or unloaded. I set carpenters ana others to work and is now in a situation to pass the Summer with management. It was a very troublesome Jobe, in very cold weather, & not a drop of Rum to give the workmen. I have the honor to draw on His Excellency the Commander in favor of Mr. Geo. McBeath for Expenses at this Post, as per vouchers annexed, as follows: For the Indian Department, the Sum of one Thousand, five Hundred, four Pounds and eleven shillings, New York Currency; and for the Engineer Department, the Sum of Eight Hundred, seventy-seven Pounds, Four shillings and eight pence, same currency. Great part of this Expense is owing to my not getting any Corn from Detroit, and had it not been for some that the Traders got for their own use, I cannot tell what I should have done. On this late alarm I was necessitated to employ Carpenters in the Fort in making Platforms, &c. No Vessell from Detroit as yet. I have the Honor to be, with great regard, Sir, Your most obedt. and most Humble Servant, DANL. ROBERTSON, Capt. 84th Regt. Major Mathews. [B 98 p 247]

SETTLEMENT AT TESSALON.

415

CAPTAIN ROBERTSON TO GENERAL HALDIMAND. MICHILIMACKINAc, 10th June, 1784. SIR, Your Excellency's Letter of the 6th of May I had the Honor to receive the 1st of June in the evening, I accordingly set out the next morning as commanded. I examined with attention every Place likely for a Settlement and only found those mentioned in my Journall, herewith annexed likely to answer the purpose, to which I refer Your Excellency as I have given. some description & my opinion. As the River Tessalon appears to me to be the most eligible I would undertake to have the Barracks proposed, built by October 1785 there, with the same number of Artificers now here, and about thirty Canalians as labour-. ers. As there are two vessels come from Detroit half loaded with merchants effects only, I have detained one of them, the Wyadote, to transport from hence every material proper for a new settlement to Tessalon, which will greatly facilitate the undertaking 'and save expenses-they consist of Pine Logs, Planks, Barrels, Shingles, Sashes, Doors, Cart Wheels, &c. I hope this will meet with Your Excellencys approbation as otherwise the Americans would have the advantage of those usefull articles. I have sent a non Commissioned officer with twelve men to take charge of the effects and clear a little ground by way of amusement. I have sent a List of Tools wanting as likewise the artificers names now here. On taking possession the Proprietors. must be consulted, they are Chipeways and will expect a few Presents. Since my last Letter to Major Mathews the Ottawas of Arbre Croche are come in and have acted as usual. I believe owing to their seeing me on my guard, They and others complain much of being neglected for their past Services, however I had nothing to give them but fair words and some hopes of getting something for them, and I am of opinion they should be handsomely taken Leave off if we mean to take Post in this Quarter. The principal Artificers here are of the 84th Regt, without them the work cannot be carried on in Case they are Reduced. Rum is very much wanted here for various purposes, particularly for Indians, and I have had only seven Barrells this twelve months. If this Plan takes place I beg your Excellency will be pleased to cause Mr.

I presume they would require some assistance on account of the extravagancies of every Article in these PartsI have had some Intelligence from white men and Indians of a very Fertile and advantageous Tract of Land between Lakes Ontario and Huron, worthy to be properly explored, and by communication that way the Trade with Canada must be carried on to put us on a footing with our neighbours from the Colony.

For these considerations and the more speedy opening that communication, I am induced to request that your Excellency will be-pleased to grant to them, Messrs. Sutherland-& Grant, myself, with any others agreeable to your Excellency that would contributp to the undertaking the said Tract of Land between these two Lakes. Mr. Benjamin Frobisher will have the Honor to wait on your Excellency in Person, on this subject, and in case it should take place he is to be acting person in Montreal. From my Connection with Indians during the War, I am well acquainted with some of the Principalls of those in that Country. I have the Honor to acquaint Your Excellency that not one Indian is come here from the Mississippi this year, owing to my having sent them Paroles to that purpose last Fall. There have been several Bands from Lake Superior, La Cloche, Missisagay and Madjadash, which I was very sorry for, as I had nothing for them, having received no Presents but a Trifle in Spring, 1780, since my coming here. As there is some appearance of being near neighbours to those People, who are numerous, and for fear of some future discontent, I was induced to borrow some Goods- and Rum, at a very great Trouble, owing to the scarcity of them, and sent them off well pleased. Your Excellency may be assured that this was not through any disregard to my Instructions, but a real opinion of the necessity of it. I have the Honor to be, With the greatest Respect, Sir, Your Excellency's most obedient and most humble Servants DANL. ROBERTSON. His Excell'y Genl. Haldimand. [B 98 p. 267]

PETITION. DETROIT, July 15th, 1784. SIR: We the Subscribers being principally interested in the Trade o4 this Place having a large Quantity of Peltry now on hand and daily expecting more all of which are intended for Montreal, and from thence to London the Season being so far advanced we have reason to fear they cannot- be transported in Time by His Majestys Vessels some of them being employed on other Services, there being three Small Shallops belonging to Individuals we pray you may allow them to Navigate between this and Fort Schlosser as well to transport the Packs as to bring Merchandize which is much wanted and will be the means of securing the Trade of this Country at least another year to Great Britain. Being persuaded you will facilitate the Trade of this Country in every Matter that does not interfere with the Good of His Majesty's Service we rely on your granting our Request.

SIR, I am of opinion that from the loss of those Vessels on Lake Erie last Fall, and of two others being now employed on Lake Huron, the remainder from the lateness of the Season will not be sufficient for the transportation of the great quantity of Peltries now here, and expected in a short

AFFAIRS AT DETROIT. 433 LIEUT. GOV. HAY TO GENERAL HALDIMAND. DETROIT, JULY 16th, 1784. SIR: I did not arrive at this place untill the 12th Instant, having been detained thirteen days at Carleton Island, and twenty-two between Niagara and Fort Erie. In oledience to your Excellency's orders of the 4th November, 1783, I, on my arrival, informed myself of the number of Loyalists at this Post and Dependencies, and find but one man of that description. Inclosed is a Return of Rations Issued to different persons not belonging to the Garrison, Navy, or Indian Department, as also Returns of the Garrison, of Engineers' Stores, of Ordnance and Ordnance Stores, and of Provisions. As a Part ofkthe Small quantity of flour in Store is damaged, I have wrote to Lieut. Colonel De Peyster to forward some by the first Vessall, to Prevent my being obliged to purchase, and which indeed cannot be done untill the present harvest is got in and the grain thrashed and grounded, many of the Inhabitants having been three months without Flour themselves, and the immoderate Price of Six Pounds York pr. Hundred being now offered by individuals and cannot be had. Mr. Thomas Williams informs me he applied to your Excellency last year to resign his employments, but has not yet received an answer, and finding his own private affairs so accumulated as to take up his whole time, now declines acting any longer, which will oblige me to receive what Records of the place he has in his possession and to appoint another person to act until I receive your Excellency's instructions upon the matter. In the mean time I have to request your Excellency will furnish me with a Warrant, to demand of and oblige all Persons to pay in their arrears of Lots, et Ventes, and all other dues. The Dunmore had a New main-mast put in her the day before yesterday, and is now almost loaded and ready to sail for Michilimackinac. Captain Robinson has wrote for two Batteaux for the use of the two Posts of Michilimackinac and Tessalon, but only one can be sent, there not being any at this Post belonging to Government, except two and a Gun Boat. The Gage has been carcen'd since I arrived, to try to stop a leak in her bottom, and is ready to sail for Fort Erie with the discharged men of the Garrison. The circumstances of two Vessals being employed on Lake Huron, and the Gage and Felicity transporting the Troops, will prevent a great Part of a very considerable quantity of Peltry from being transported a cross the 55

AFFAIRS AT DETROIT-DRAFT.

Leakes early enough to be sent to Europe this year, to the great detriment of Commerce, which has been represented to me by those cohcerned in it; to obviate which, together with Commodore Grant's opinion, I have been induced to permit three small Sloops from Ten to Twenty Tons belonging to Individuals to sail to Fort Erie with Peltries, with orders not to quit Company with the Kings Vessell with which they are to Sail, except by stress of weather. One of these Small Sloops had already sailed for Fort Erie before Smy arrival. Inclosed is a Copy of the representation above mentioned which I hope your Excellency will think sufficient for my granting their request as to the transportation of Peltries. I beg your Excellency will let me know your pleasure regarding the validity of the conveyance of Lots of ground belonging to the King within the Fort by Lieut. Colonel De Peyster. I have the Honour to be, Your Excellency's most obedient and most humble Servant, JERU HAY. His Excellency General Haldimand. [B 123 p 462] CAPTAIN ROBERTSON TO SECRETARY MATTHEWS.

McBeath the following Sums. Indian Department, One Thousand Eight Hundred, seventy seven Pounds, Five Shillings and eight Pence York Currency.

[B 98 p 269] CAPTAIN ROBERTSON TO COL. CLAUS. MICHILIMAKINAO, 22nd July, 1784. SIR, The Bearer Mr. Calv6 arrived here a Week ago. I hope it has answered the intended purpose, in sending him among the Indians, he has had some disagreement with a Mr. Aird now at Montreal, from what I have heard, this same Aird is a very improper Person to be in this Country, however Calv6 will tell you the story himself. The Indians are pretty quiet considering that I have nothing for them.

[Indian Affairs M. G. IV.] LIEUT. GOV. HAT TO GENERAL HALDIMAND. DETROIT 22nd July 1784 SIR, I take the opportunity of Commodore Grants going to Quebec, to inclose to your Excellency a List of the names of those who claim Indian Lands in the vicinity of this Place, from Grants recorded in the Recorders office, and as I understand by the knowledge of the Commanding Officers here since the year 1780, by which it will appear your Excellency's orders to me to discountenance such proceedings, is [something too Late to have any effect, as almost all the Land-between the Lakes Erie and Huron on both sides the Streight is claimed and a great part setttled upon and improved.If it is your Excellency's pleasure this should be stopp'd nothing bunt your Excellency's publick and positive orders will affect it.



Page 436

CLAIMS.

As Lieut. Governor Hamilton knows the most of the claimants he can inform your Excellency many of them are very unworthy any indulgence in that way. I have consulted Mr. McKee upon the most probable method of obtaining a Tract for the Crown to be distributed as your Excellency may think proper, and he is of opinion with me, that a stripe of two or three Leagues deep on the Streight between the Lakes Erie and Huron may be easily obtained, but that a greater quantity might give umbrage to the nations on the Lakes. He likewise tells me the purchase which has been made at Niagara has not been made known to the Lake Indians, and it is more than probable they will not be pleased with the bounderies extending so far up Lake Erie.I am informed several of the reduced Provincial Officers and many of the Soldiers wish to settle on the South side of Detroit rather than anywhere elseSeveral have built upon and improved Lands who have no other Pretensions than the Indians consent possession, Captains Bird and Caldwell are of the number, at a place they have called Fredericks Burg; besides all which there are some concessions of Lots in the Town of which I have not yet got a full accountI have the Honor to be Your Excellency's, most obedient, and most Humble Servant,, JEHU HAY.

ISLAND OF ORLE'ANS, 5th Augt., 1784. I am sorry to inform you that your Friend the Governor is in a worse way than when you left him. I have called twice, but could not see him, & understand from Monsr. De Roski that he has taken it into his head that I am sent by you and Mr. Sinclair to pry into his affairs and see what is passing at his house, that I may give you Intelligence. so that I shall avoid giving him any more cause for uneasiness. It seems he is much displeased at you and Mr. Sinclair & thinks you persecute him. He has likewise accused Monsr. De Roski of being in the League. 'He sleeps little or none, keeps himself mostly shut up in his Chamber, with the Door locked, & has committed sev- / eral little extravagancies which it is needless to mention. Monsr. De Roski is of opinion, and I think he is right, that if possible some Friend should come and stay with him, who could have some influence & who could amuse him. I wish you could devise some method, as you are acquainted with his connections, and I am fully persuaded you have his interest much at heart. Indeed, from Dr. Roche's Account of the matter it begins to be very serious; as his Melancholy increases daily,God knows what may be the consequence. I thought it my Duty to give you a fair account of what I have heard from 56

LIEUT. GOV. HAY' TO GENERAL HALDIMAAND. DETROIT, August 5th, 1784. SIR, In my Letter of the 16th July I mentioned to your Excellency Mr. Williams declining.to act in a public capacity any longer and the necessity of appointing another person in his place. I have not however, nor shall I appoint any one untill I-am Honored with your Excellency's Orders. In the mean time Mr. Williams has got a Mr. Monferton to do the business of Notary, for and in Mr. Williams' place. I think him a proper person for that office and Van due Master apd reconmmend him to your Excellency as always having shewn grate zeal for His Majesty's Service, and from his attention and good example has maintained every good order in his Company of Militia on the South side the River. As all public works are ordered to cease here, it is my duty to inform your Excellency that the Front and rear of this Town is open, the Pickets having been taken down by order of Lieut. Colonel De Peyster and the continuation of the Lots to the river given to the proprietors saving a Cart road at the Waters Edge, by which means a discontended Indian may any night set fire to the Town. The Ground given by Lieut. Colonel De Peyster as above mentioned was formerly the wood yard, but now the Barrack Master is obliged to pile his wood at so great a distance on each side the Town that no Sentry from the Garrison can take charge of it. Captain Bird acting Engineer has reported to me that part of Fort Lernoult has been much damaged this Spring and Summer by heavy rains, and if not repaired will soon not be defensible, but I shall not allow a sixpence expence upon either without your Excellency's orders. The Soldiers Barracks will not be lodgable this winter without some little repair. Two Prisoners whom the Indians had promised to deliver up with many others, at a General Meeting held by Mr. McKee last year, came in from the Indian Country since I had the honore of writing to your Excellency, and many of the discharged rangers are returned here from Niagara, the most of whom will I believe follow the example of those at Niagara, and return to their homes in the Colonies whenever they can. A certain-Isaac Tines who has been Prisoner with the Hurons from his infancy, left this place before my arrival to purchase Cattle near Fort Pitt, and I am informed was pursued on his return by a Colonel Williams of Wheeling (the same who cut off the moravian Indians) who took his cattle from him, and carried him back Prisoner. Several -of their People were



Page 444

AFFAIRS AT DETROIT.

allowed (before my arrival) to come here on their private affairs and return without hindrance. It is this last description of People whom I requested your Excellency's instructions upon, in my letter of the 19th April from Montreal, to which your Excellency did not make an answer, and I do not find any orders (among the few I found here) for my guidance, on that, and many other subjects. It is likewise my duty to represent to your Excellency that the standing orders for the Posts in regard to Indian affairs, as given to the officer of that Department and to which your Excellency ordered me to conform to in the same manner as any merely Military Commandant, have not been, nor can they be strictly complied with, without disgusting the Indians; to support which I call upon all those who have had, or actually has the management of those affairs since 1783. That while these orders virtually annul that part of my appointment from the King as Superintendent here (of whic h I wrote to your Excellency before I left Quebec in November last) they empower the Deputy Agent to distribute Provisions and the Presents sent out by Government for the Indians, Independent of me and as he sees proper and yet I am ordered to prevent abuses therein: That as no Rum is sent up here or any allowed to be purchased with many other articles which can not be brought into an estimate, but not the less necessary, to keep the Indians in good Temper, a greater expence is brought on Government than otherwise would be necessary, and a Door opened for greater abuse, than that which it might be intended to prevent. My long residence here and personal knowledge of the principal Indians and-Tribes, and the confidence they always have and do now shew they have in me renders it very difficult for me to obey your Excellency's orders, and not displease them in such a manner as may bring on bad consequences. They look up to me as His Majesty's first servant here, and expect that advice they formerly received from-me in an inferior Capacity, and I have been obliged in the presence and by desire of the Deputy Agent, to hear and Speake to them of Matters which I am ordered and prohibited from interforeing in at the same I have it not in my power to gratify the smallest trifling demand they may make, let me be ever so well convinced of the propriety of it. The Deputy Agent Mr. McKee is a very good man and understands the management of Indians as well as any officer in the Department and is very sensible of the necessity of my shewing them the same attention I formerly did, and which they in a great measure expect, but which I cannot do, and strictly comply with the orders above mentioned, My Zeal and wish to see His Majesty's Service carried on to the best ad

vantage and with the least expense to the nation, and a duty I owe myself, obliges me to represent these things to your Excellency.Mr. Albay late Barrack Master being struck off from his Employ, and finding it impossible to live here on the Pay since offered him to act has requested permission to go to Quebec, which I have granted him, he having delivered over the Barrack stores to a person he named to do that duty here, who I believe is capable of it, a Mr. Sparkman. Conducter of Artillery. -Mr. Albay's know good character, his age and long services will I make no doubt be considered by your Excellency.Captains McKee and Lamothe, have spoke to me concerning two Lots which are built upon belonging to the King, and whibh they now occupy on the outside the Town. The boundaries I have inclosed In case your Excellency will please to favour them with deeds, they wish they may be dated before the peace. Mr. Joucair Chabert, late captain in the Indian Department informs me your Excellency gave him to understand his Pay should not be stopped before the rest of the' Department, that nevertheless he was struck off when he left this for Quebec last year, bit hopes your Excellency will answer a Bill drawn by Mr. McKee to put him on a footing with those who were paid since that time. Upon a m >re strict enquiry than I was able to make when I wrote your Excellency the 16th Instant, I find there are twelve persons here who come under the description of Loyalists, and Uaptain.Bird (from who's account of them I first mad,e my Report) tells me thera are many of other descriptions who wish to settle near where he is making a settlement for himself whos characters for their loyalty is very well known.] The Warrant which I requested from your Excellency in my Letter of the 16th July, for demanding and enforcing the payment of the Kings due here, I find daily more and more necessary. Inclosed is a monthly return of provisions t9 the 24th July. The Issues to prisoners will be now reduced as they are mostly sent away, many however remain with the Indians who will get off and come in when they find opportunities. I have the Honour to be Your Excellency's Most obedient and most Humble Servant. JEHU HAY. His Excellency General H ddimzn 1. Endorsed.-A 1781 From Lt. Govr. Hay 5th Augt. Reo'd 13th. [B 123 p 475]

BEALTH OF GOV. ~INCLAIR.

CAPTAIN HOPE TO COLONEL HOPE. DEsu SIR, You know the Connection of Mrs. Hope with Governor Sinclair, and the motives of Gratitude that have induced her & me to pass some days at different times along with him, upon the Island of Orleans last Winter and this Spring, in the course of which I am sorry to have to say from the extravagance of his discourse at particular moments, we could not but suspect of late that the State of his mind was much disordered, & that His Health was daily impairing, in which sentiments we are both more confirmed by a conversation of Governor Sinclair's at our House late in the evening yesterday, & which therefore I think it now incumbent upon me to communicate in this manner to you, submitting it to yoar judgement whether it will not be proper that His Eccellency the Commander in Chief should be made acquainted with it, that he may take such steps in the present unhappy situation of Governor Sinclair's mind as may appear fittest under such circumstances, to which I have only to add that if His Excellency shall think proper that Governor Sinclair should go to England for the recovery of his health, or to be under the more immediate care of his nearer Relations, and that the General will think proper to send him Home in the same ship that I am ordered to embark in, Mrs. Hope and I shall very readily pay every attentionto him in our power during the passage and act in the b3st manner for him that circumstances on our arrival may make appear illegible or in such other, as His Excellency may think proper to direct. The conversation I allude to last night was to the best of my recollection nearly as follows: " Mrs. Hope the season is now far advanced and it is absolutely requisite to come to some determination, I know from the late proceedings in the Council and the passing of the Habeas Corpus Bill, I say, I know, & I am certain the moment I read it of what has happened at Home, you may rely upon it that His Excellency is appointed Commander in Chief of America, and I am sure I am Civil Governor of Canada, it is certainly intended at Home, that Head Quarters shall be at Hallifax, & that General Haldimand is to bh fixed there, upon those terms I would not accept of their appointment as Civil Governor here, however if His Excellency will promise me to remain in Canada, I shall take the burthen of the business and the acting contrary so far to any orders from Home by His Excelly. remaining here upon my shoulders, in that case I shall go Home, and there I shall be able to represent truths, upon my going Home, if I have not a Seat in Parliament I shall immediately purchase one, and in the course of two years, I am certain I shall be able to make things appear in their proper light, & then I shall return to Canada in any capacity they shall think proper under General Haldi~

mand, as this is a delicate matter to lay before His Excellency am at a little loss it what Channel it should be conveyed to him, however I think Colonel Hope is the proper Person-I therefore think it is necessary you should wait upon him early in the morning and repeat this conversation to him and, when he has laid it before the General, you will then inform me & I will do myself the Honor of waiting upon the Colonel, should the General see any part of this in a different light, will do anything his Excelly thinks best for the Public good but upon a smaller scale I will do nothing." The extravagance and wildness apparent throughout the whole of the above Rhapsidy cannot fail to strike you no doubt in much the same manner as it has done us, but as I said before I submit it entirely to your Judgement in what manner to act. I have the Honor to be Dear Sir Your most obedient Humble Servt. ERSKINE HOPE, Petit Riviere, near Quebec, 9th August, 1784. From Captain Hope to Colonel Hope relatlve'to Governor Sinclair's health. Oth August. [B 98 p 274] LIEUT. GOV. HAY TO GENERAL HALDIMAND. DETROIT August 13th 1784. SIR, The information I got from Mr. McKee regarding Isaac Tines appears to be false as he and nine white men from the Ohio have since arrived here with Cattle, some of whom wanted to remain in this Settlement, but as I'have been informed the behaviour of those who have come in at several different times has not been very proper, and as I think it very probable: if any number who are not of approved good characters should introduce themselves here it would be of bad consequence to His Majesty's Service, I ordered them to leave the Settlement as soon as they had sold their Cattle, Mr. Mckee, who is well acquainted with the People of that country is of the same opinion, but it appears that the Americans look upon it that they have a right to travel in any part of the boundaries of the American States, and in a Speech to the Indians have desired they will not 'molest any who may think proper so to do.The states of Pennsylvania & Virginia have proposed holding Councils with the Indians at Fort Pitt and the Fallsof the Ohio which embarrasse them a good deal, as they naturally suppose these meetings are calculated for the

private Interest of the States who want to hold them, and may be different from the General Meeting by order of the CongressI beg your Excellency will Honour me with your Instructions with regard to Subjects of the States, who may come thro the Indian Country to this Place. In the mean time tho' I can not prevent their coming here, I shall take every measure in my power to prevent their acting in any manner contrary to the good of His Majesty's Service. I am however very apprehensive bad effects will be the consequence of those Peoples coming so hastily into the Indian Country before they have paved their way by some General Meetings with the Indians whos Savage Blood is not yet perfectly cool. Agreeable to your Excellency's orders signified to me by Lieut. Colonel De Peyst'er, for disbanding all persons under the denomination of Provincials, the 24th June last. I ordered the accounts of all those who had been paid by Lieut. Colonel De Peyster to the 24th May, to be made up to that period; and have signed a Bill on your Excellency for the Amount being Seventy seven pounds 18-10 d 2-7 N. Y. Currency in favour of Messrs. Alexr. & Wm. Macomb. Mr. Chabert did not know his Pay had been drawn for to the 24th May last when he desired I should amention him to your Excellency. Yesterday I signed another Bill on your Excellency in favour of the same Gentlemen for, or, in lieu of Rum agreeable to the issues by the Commissaryamounting to Seventy Nine pounds 3-6 N. Y. Currency. Notwithstanding the assistance the small vessels have given in taking Peltry from this to Fort Erie of which I informed your Excellency in my Letter of the 16th July; there is yet a quantity that can not be sent away for want of conveyance, besides upwards of a Thousand Packs which will be ready in a few days; and as the Reduction in the Navy Department has taken place in consequence of your Excellency's orders to Captain Grant (which he did me the favour to shew me) the greatest part will not be transported across the Lakes time enough for the Departure of the English ships this Autumn. The Commissary of Provisions tells me the Garrison of Michilimakinac will be out of Provisions in a few days-Captain Robertson however has not mentioned it, but as a small Vessell with a Detachment of the 8th Regt. is expected daily from thence, if I find it to be the case on her arrival I shall be under the necessity of Permitting a small Vessell (private property) to sail for that port, and send in her as much as will serve them untill provisions can be sent in the Kings Vessells. We have received such supplies here as to prevent the necessity of purchasing. Inclosed is a Monthly return of the Garrison the four men mentioned, dis-: 4a

SIR, I am at last necessitated to lay my very particular and disagreeable situation before His Excellency the Commandei in Chief through you, and I hope he will be so good, as on all occasions to me, to consider my case in its true light, as the Publick Interest has been, and ever will be my constant study, as far as concerned in Pablick mattersLast year and this I borrowed some Rum at different times as the service required it, on the good faith and expectation of getting up some of this article, as well as other Indian Goods, sufficient to replace the same, as I agreed, one article for another, according to their different Prices, but to my grea sorrow not a single article has been sent to this Post since June 1783-and by Colonel Campbell at that timeMr. McBeath, who I employed to procure me the Rum, apply'd in behalf S of the Concerned, repeatedly, but I always delayed, still in expectation of some comfort from below, untill now, when I am asked the Payment as all their Outfitts are made and of course that article entirely useless to them, and Returns for their Goods expected below this Fall, therefore I will be oblidged to Include that in the Three Months' Account.

as long as they are able. They say they did not call out for Peace, they always thought the Americans desired it, and they listened to it thro' the advice of their father; but never entertained an Idea that the Americans looked upon them a conquered people until the Declaration of their Conimissioners inform them thereof. Notwithstanding their pacific disposition heretofore and readiness to be advised upon this head; the dayly proofs they are receiving of their designs upon their Country; lessens the influence of restraining and keeping them peaceable. Several persons are arrived yesterday from the neighborhood of Pittsburgh, seeking an asylum from the persecutions they are subjected to in 'the states on account of their principles during the late war, and they say that many others in the same predicament are about to remove to this place, or some other within the protection of His Majesty's Government, where encouragement will be given to them.

in England, to whom from this Country there are immense Sums still due, will be materially injured if not altogether ruined. Your Petitioners most solemnly affirm that they have for some years past been paying an annual Interest of upwards of Three Thousand seven Hundred pounds Sterling on the amount of Property detain'd on its way hither at Carleton Island and on the Communication at Niagara; and this as is obviously known proceeds fro'm the want of a Sufficient number of King's vessels to transport the goods destin'd for this Country, or a permission to Merchants vessels to carry their own property. Your Petitioners further represent that though the King's vessels have made several Voyages to and from Fort Erie this season none of the Merchandise that have remain'd in the Store Houses on the Communication above Niagara & at Fort Erie,since last fall and which amount to a very considerable sum is yet arrived.. Your Petitioners have had the honor to transmit a memorial through Lieut. Govr. Hay to Colonel Hope requesting that the Gage which now lies here & could as they are informed soon be got ready may be ordered to sail; in this Request your Petitioners solicitously beg your approbation & support as a measure tending to lessen their present misfortune and as affording them some temporary relief. Your Petitioners think it incumbent on them to make this General Representation-That from the Delays, Difficulties & Consequent Losses arising from the same (to say nothing of the notorious and unparallelled Thefts that have been committed) that have for some time attended the carrying on the Trade of this upper Country owing principally to the prohibition of Merchants Vessels from carrying their own Goods, or the Want of a Sufficient number of King's Vessels to transport without Embarrassment & Delay the Merchandise necessary for the Supply of this Post & its Dependences and?or the carrying on the Fur Trade that Trade in General & this Branch in -particular, has been much circumscribed & of late nearly ruined; that last year owing to the late arrival of such Goods as did reach this post, above one Thousand Packs of Furs and Peltry which used annually to be remitted to Detroit have this Year from our Inability to supply the Traders in time been sent to New Orleans; & that upwards of Fifty of the Pettyaugers which left this place last Fall loaded with Goods proper for the Indian Trade were from their late Departure frozen up before they reached the places of their Destination, & that many Traders after a fruitless attendance returned unsupplied. Your Petitioners solemmly declare that unless a speedy and effectual Rem

DEAR SIR, In my last respects I partly anticipated yours of the 29th relative to the probability of the trade to the port of Detroit & its dependencies falling soon into the hands of the Americans were private Vessels permitted on the lakes at present, anything further which I may observe will be almost a repetition or perhaps setting the matter in a clearer point of view. You will be good enough to remark that the Upper Country Trade in general, as now carried on from this place, is extended as far South as the mouth of the Ohio, to the Westward as far as the Rivers falling from that side of the Mississippi, will carry canoes, including from the River of

in Latitude 33 degrees 8 to the Sources of the Mississippi & to the Northwest as far as lake Arabaskda including the whole north side of Lake Huron and Superior, the value of the whole I esteem at ~180,000 currency for the sake of statement and I believe I am not ~20,000 on either side of the reality~100,000 Value I think is brought from the Country now within the American line as fix'd by the late treaty of Peace; the other ~80,000 I consider as being within our own Line-If this Statement is nearly Just & I am satisfied to risk my reputation upon it as a Merchant, the question will be, whither the Americans are likely to take away any part of our trade when they shall have got possession of the posts & vessels on the Lakes, or wither we are not more likely by having posts on the same Lakes and vessels to interfere with them. For my own part I am clearly of opinion that it must be a very long time before they can even winter on the smallest part of our trade, for the little that is to be had in the tract of Country lying between Lakes Ontario, Erie & Huron as South Boundaries & the Ottawa River, lake Nipissing and its discharge into Lake Huron as Northern Boundaries, can only be obtained by traders going up the different Rivers which water that tract of Country, there passing the Winter and trading with the Indians-and this can onlybe done in Birch Canoes, which will require them a long time to become accustomed to, exclusive of the Legal impediment of trading in a Country to which they are AliensThe same reasons are applicable to the trade on the North Shores of Huron & Superior & to the North West Trade, in my opinion for some contest that the Grand Portage is within the American line, but to us it does not appear very certain, or if it were, it is of no great moment with regard to the N. W. Trade; for a New road has been discovered from the Lake of -- or Nipigan which runs to the N of Wood, Lakes & falls into the discharge of that Lake - (which is commonly known by the name of the River) at the distance of fifty Leagues from its N. W. termination-It was gone over last Summer and found to be more practicable than the road from the Grand Portage now in useThese circumstances being considered,what are the reasons that could induce the traders from this country to dis-pose of tfieir fine furr's which are got within our Lines? Will the Americans pay a higher price for them than can be obtained in London! No. and were the desirous of tempting with a higher offer-No man in his sences would trust to them, and surely they cannot carry up money to buy them, besides it is well known that were these fine furrs to fall into their hands in any quantity they must send them to England for a Market as amongst themselves the consumption is very trifling-We may

463

therefore infer that there is little probability of the Americans rivaling us soon in the tract which legally belongs to the Province were they even allowed a free CompetitionIt remains to consider how far we may interfere with the trade within their line & by what means, should the Americans under pain of confiscation prohibit all Btritish Subjects from trading in the Indian Country within their Line, I make no doubt that the greatest part of the traders who are now at Detroit will become American Subjects, because they will thereby keep in their hands the trade they at present pursue, for I am of opinion that the Americans by Establishing a very few posts on the South of Lake Erie might hinder smuggling in any great degree, but at the same time if we can afford Goods at Detroit cheaper than they can & are enabled to give better prices for furrs or Peltries. The traders on their side will fall on means to do business with us even at Detroit, notwithstanding any regulations they may make to the contrary-That both these things may take place I am pretty confident, for we can without doubt transport Goods to the Upper posts cheaper than they can, provided we were allowed equal means of facility and by the same reasoning we can bring down Peltries at less expence-Such being the case we are more likely to be of Injury to their part of the trade than they are to ours, more especially if it is considered that even when they were British Subjects and had every facility and benefit in the whole of the Indian trade, there was not consumed amongst themselves above half of the Peltries the obtained, the other half going home to England as a permittance; indeed except Deer Skins which then formed their Chief Article with some Beaver and Racoons, every other article was sent to England, if therefore they are obliged to send them still in same manner, they can be on no better footing at Albany than we are here, but rather worse as their expences to bring the Peltries to that place will be greater than oursAll then that Government has to do is to give every facility to the trade that is possible, and. I do not see a more certain means of conveniency and certainty than by allowing the merchants' to have small deck'd vessels of their own-with them they can ever be morally certain of having their Goods at Market in June and July and then Goods may be imported the same year from England, which will save them from leakage imbesslement and wait of their property besides Interest of money which you know is a dreadful moth if ones allowed to get to any head. That these Vessels should be under proper regulations is highly requisite, but time must be allowed for digesting a proper System-the present is to busy a Season besides I would not wish to attempt it alone, and I would be

NECESSITY FOR TRANSPORTATION.

also desirous of having a more perfect local knowledge of Lake Erie than I now have before I venture on such a task. But whatever future regulations may be adopted, they do not relieve us from our present distress, the last Infrmation from Niagara is so late is the 16 of last month at which time there were little if any thing short of 100 Battoe Loads of Goods to cross Lake Erie, besides from thirty to forty at Cataraquoi mostly intended in the same way-That a considerable part of these will be got over this season is highly probable, but unless measures are taken without any delay whatever to have them transported speedily, it is to be apprehended that they may, as last year arrive at Detroit too late to admitt of being sent into the more interior Country amongst the Indians, in which case fewer furrs will be got, for you will remark that the Indians do not bring much of their Peltry to the Post-the Traders must go for it, they must pass the Winter amongst them and supply them occasionally with Oloathing Ammunition &c, otherwise the hunt little and are not careful of their Peltry. The measures which in my opinion might be adopted without any great hindrance to the Service or any great infraction of orders would be, to order that the four vessels on Lake Erie (as soon as Michilimackinac is supplied) do each of them make two trips to Detroit with Merchant's - Goods, but that the second trip is not to exceed the 15th October at latest for the time of loading at Fort Erie, after which time they can very easily make another, which I should think would be more than sufficient to carry provisions for one year for the Garrison, and at the same time as there are three or four small private vessels, that, they may for this Season be allowed to sail for benefit of their owners under Command or Inspection of a King's Officer, so as to prevent at all events any smuggling whilst we hold the Indians tract exclusively. If some such plan is not adopted I fear that bad Consequences will be the effects of the present System. The traders will get disperited and careless, they will even wish for a change of Government in hopes of being bettered thoe' they certainly will be much worse; but such were their Sufferings last Year witl- the untoward prospect for the present one, that I fear few Goods will be ordered for the ensuing or Houses of any Reputation here found to execute them until this defect is remedied. As this Letter is chiefly occasioned by the impediments to the Detroit trade, which I have endeavoured to show you may be removed without giving any encouragement, to the Americans therein. I have said nothing of the trade on the South side of Lake Huron, Superior or to the West of Michilimackinac because it is carried on in Canoes from hence, and therefore meets no obstruction, nor will it be an easy matter for the Americans to get any part of it, notwithstanding the Country is within their Line. In short I am decidedly

of opinion that no part whatever of the Trade belonging to this Province by the treatyof Peace is likely to fall into the hands of the Americans but on the contrary that we may get a considerable part of theirs. I am Dear Sir, Your affectionate and very Humble Servant, (signed) JAMES MCGILL. P. S.-I must not omit mentioning that the merit of discovering the new route to the N.

the time of this tranquility, we were devising the best method we could to form as good a reconciliation as possible with you the thirteen United Statesthat might be permanent and lasting-and at the same time we thought that we were to make an agreeable reconciliation and lasting frindship with a set of people born on the same continent with ourselves, and that the quarrel that was between us was not of our own making. In the course of our animadversions, we found out one thing that might occasion a lasting peace between us. Brothers, We the Indian nations are still of the same opinion as at that time with respect to the matter that may tend to reconcile us to each other at this Council. Notwithstanding we had the best thoughts in our minds during the before mentioned period, nevertheless mischief has happened between you and us. We are however still anxious of putting our laudable plan of accomodation into Execution, and we shall now inform you of the matter, which we devised and considered of, as tending to make a peace, which is, that we intended, whenever we the Indians entered into any negociations with you, we should be all of one mind and one voice in our speeches, with the whole of our confederacy of the different languages which the Great Spirit planted on this ground we meant to finish them in a general manner. For we understood that your meaning was, that whenever we should have a Council that some landed matters were to be transacted at it-a matter of the greatest importance to us, is that respecting our territories or giving away lands-when a division of territory is agreed to by some particular nations without the concurrence of the whole of our confederacy, we look upon it as illegal and of no effect, for it is a general concern, and unless it is transacted with the unanimous consent of the whole, it can never stand good. Brothers, we think it is owing to yourselves that the peace between us has not lasted, and that that essential good has been blended with confusion, because that you did everything respecting it your own-way, you made your Council fires where you thought proper. Our plan was not followed which was to speak to you in a general manner and with the voices of all the Different nations of our Confederacy. If this had taken place, we are almost certain that you and we, would now have been on the most amicable footing. We did everything in our power at the Treaty of Fort Stamoix to pursue this plan, as our real intentions were at that very time to promote peace and concord between us, and that we might look upon each other as friends, and we gave you no cause or provocation to be otherwise.

Brothers, We are still of opinion to pursue those just steps of promoting tranquility and happiness between us, notwithstanding the mischief that happened-we wish you would take it into consideration and let us speak to you in the manner we proposed. Let us have a treaty with you early in the spring, let us pursue reasonable steps, let us meet half way for our mutual convenience. We shall then bury in oblivion the mischief that has happened, and speak to each other in the style of friendship. Brothers, We say let us meet half way and pursue such steps as become upright and honest men, until which time we beg that you will prevent your Surveyors and- other people from coming on our side of the Ohio River; we have told you ibefore we wish you to pursue just steps, and we are determined that they shall appear just and reasonable in the eyes of the World. This is the determination of all our Chiefs of our Confederacy now assembled here, notwithstanding the accidents thathave happened in our Villages and when in Council, where several innocent Chiefs were killed when absolutely engaged in promoting a peace with you the thirteen United States. Altho' then interrupted, the Chiefs here present still wish to meet you in the Spring for the before mentioned good purpose, when we hope to speak to each other in a style unaccompanied by haughtyness or menaces. Brothers, We again-request of you in the most earnest manner that you will order your Surveyors and others that march on lands to cease from crossing the Ohio, untill we shall have spoke to you because the mischief that has recently happened has always originated in that quarter, we shall likewise preserve our people from going over untill that time. Brothers, It will be owing to your arrogance if this laudable plan, which we so earnestly wish for, is not carried into execution, in that case the result will be very precarious and if fresh ruptures ensue, we are confident we shall be able to exculpate ourselves & most assuredly with our united force be obliged to defend those immunities which the Great Spirit has been pleased to give us, and if we should then be reduced to misfortune, the world will pity us, when they think of the amicable proposals we made to prevent the effusion of unnecessary blood. This is the purposes of our determinations and we ardently desire that you will transmit to us, as soon as possible your answer, be it what it will. Done at our Confederate Council here at the Huron Village near the mouth of the Detroit River. Decr 18th 1786. Here are our names The Five Nations Hurons

Major Ancrum then answered and told them that he was sorry for the interruptions they met with and the misfortunes that happened at their first Council fire, and at the same time he was happy to find that their late Council had been conducted with moderation and wisdom, and hoped it would be productive of the desireable end, and that we might all equally enjoy the Bless

473

Honorable Committee, they will be taken into consideration with candour and liberality. In treating of thosesubjects, we have divided them under different Heads or propositions which we shall state with our observations thereon as they occur. S.Questions. 1st. What are the best and most advantageous means of carrying on the Trade to the Upper Countries, having regard to the different communications of the Grand River, and that of the Lakes, and whether there should not be a fixed and permanent Law for regulating that trade and ascertaining the Rights of derniers Equipeurs and other objects relating thereto? 2nd. A Judicial Establishment for the decisions of Suits at the Posts of Detroit and Michilimackinac under certain restrictions3rd. In the Event that the Navigation of the Lakes be not open and free for private vessels, what are the best regulations to be demanded for the Transport of the Merchants goods? 4th, The best means for the Encouragement of the New Settlements. It is the opinion of this Committee that the trade be continued open and free to all His Majesty's Subjects, and that every facility and protection which the peculiar nature of this Trade, its extent and consequence yequire, be laid before the Honorable Committee of Council. In considering of the upper Country Trade, it will be proper to estimate the Balance which it now owes to this Province, its annual value and the means of facility and protection for carrying it on which appears to be absolutely necessary. First. With regard to the Balance at present owing by that Trade to this province, and chiefly to the Town of Montreal, we may with safety assure, that it rather exceeds than falls short of ~300,000 Sterling, of which about ~125,000 from Cataraqui to Detroit, and the Dependencies of that Post, and ~175,000 by Michilimackinac and the Country depending thereon, which comprehends the whole Tracts to the Westward and Northward of the East side of Lake Huron and as the returns of two years at least will be requisite to pay of that Balance it points out strongly the necessity of keeping possession of the Posts, for were they to be given up, a very great proportion of that large sum would be lost, to the hurt of the nation, and the ruin of numberless individuals. In Speaking of the annual returns of the Indian Trade from above Montreal, it is hardly necessary to observe that every Article of Merchandize employed in it is of British Manufactory. This fact is so well known as to require no formal proof. 60

It follows therefore of course that every increase of the Trade tends to benefit the parent state, a circumstance deserving the most serious consideration. Without entering into a detail of the number of every species of Furs and Skins received from the Upper Country, we venture to warrant after the maturest deliberation, that the whole value from Michilimackinac to Detroit with their Dependencies is not short of ~160,000 Sterling, of which we esteem 3-5'b" to proceed from the Grand River communication, and the other 2-5"", from the communication of the Lakes. To facilitate and protect this Trade, which by the emulation of Individuals, or by the efforts of temporary concerns, has been carried to a much greater extent and distance than whilst it was confined to Farmers or Proprietors of Posts, and is still susceptible of further improvements, it is not only necessary that it should continue open and free, and that the Posts should be kept possession of, but some Regulations and Laws are also wanted to put it on a Better footing than it is at present, and of these we shall take the liberty of speaking as they occur. Licenses. By the present regulations Traders are obliged to give in the names and places of abode of their Canoe and batteaumen upon oath; this cannot.possibly be complied with, for it frequently happens, that from sickness, Desertion or some other cause, one, two or three of the men engaged for a Canoe, will be wanting at the moment it is necessary to sett off. The Trader must of course engage others, which is frequently done at La Chine, or in proceeding to the end of the Island, and it would be too hard to oblige him to return to Town, in order to have their names inserted in place of those who may have left him. This ceremony therefore of swearing should be dispensed with, and we cannot help thinking that no inconvenience would arise to Government, were they to dispense altogether with the names and places of abode of the men, or if required, that it should be confined to such as are engaged for long voyages, and not generally extended to the men engaged in battoeing goods to Carleton Island, or Catara'qui, whose Voyage is within the Province, and not of more than fifteen days duration and who frequently are engaged at La Chine the moment they are wanted. But if Policy requires that the number of Hands and the Districts which furnish them should be known to Government, it would be a more easy and certain method to obtain their names after the Canoes and Batteaus are sent off, either from the Trader himself or his Sureties. T-eatment Pf the Traders at the Posts. Some few years ago it was assumed by the officers or Lieut Governors corn

REPORT ON THE STATE OF TRADE. 475 manding at Posts to parcel out the places of Trade to such only as they thought proper of the Traders, to make them pay High Fees for Passes and Bonds, and also for wood as a supposed perquisite, and all this notwithstanding the Licenses of the Governor Commander in Chief of the Province-A check has been put to those Practices by an article inserted in the Licenses, which restrains officers commanding at fhe Posts, as well from preventing the Traders, their clerks or men going to the posts or places as they think best for the purpose of Trade-and further requires them to grant passes for that purpose without any other charge than a Dollar for a Pass-Pointed orders to that effect oughtto be at all Garrisons. The protection and not the impeding the Trade being the principal occasion of Fxontier distant Garrisons. 1st There is an article of the License which by mistake subjects the Michilimackinac Traders to bring down their Furrs in the King's Vessels, and altho' the good sense of the officer commanding at that Post has seen it in that light, and therefore permitted the Furrs to be sent down as usual, by the way of the Grand River, it would be proper to have it rectified for the time to come. 2d. Men deserting. In carrying on the Indian Trade it is frequently necessary to advance money to the Canoe-men, in contemplation of the Services they are to perform, and it too often happens that some of them desert, or do not appear to perform the Voyage. In such cases, and where no good and sufficient reason can be given for such absence, besides an action for Debt and Damages they ought to be subject to Improvement, not exceeding three months, but untill they shall have satisfied the Judgement as a Punishment for breach of Covenant, and as an example to others, it being well known that the dread of a Prison operates very powerfully on that class of men. 3d. Engages not to be stopped for Debt. In order to prevent misunderstandings and Difficulties between Traders and Canoe-men or Battoe-men their Engagements, when for continuing during the Winter in the Upper Country, should be made out by a notary when practicable, under pain of nullity. Traders advancing to other than their own men, ought not to have the power or right at Michilimackinac of preventing such men from prosecuting any voyage they may engage with for another. 4th. Privilege of last Outfitter & Canoe-men. As in the Indian Trade it has generally been considered that the Merchant

REPORT ON THE STATE OF TRADE.

advancing Goods to a Trader was running greater risk, than is esteemed to be the case in any other line of business, and that the labour of the Canoe-men merited the most punctual Payment of their wages; it has been a Law of Custom to assure to the Canoe-men a Privilege on the returns for Payment of their wages, and after them to the Merchant for his advances; but of late it has been found extremely difficult, from the Trade having become more general, or the mal practices of the Traders, to ascertain this customary Privilege to the Merchant, and in consequence many suits have arisen to the Injury and Detriment of the Merchant-being the last outfitter. To remedy this evil as far as appears possible, and without laying unnecessary restraints on Persons concerned in that Business, It seems proper that a Law should be made to assure the Canoe-men of their wages from the Returns or Goods Remaining provided they apply for the same within one month after their arrival at the place where their voyage ends, but not to admit them to any Preference after that time is elapsed-as it might subject a bond fide Purchaser of such Returns or Goods remaining, or a bond fide creditor who may have received payment. The one to pay twice, and the other to restitution. And the same Law should enact, That no other Claims whatever (such as are hereafter mentioned excepted) shall be intitled to Payment from the Goods of a last Outfitter in the hands of a Trader, or the returns of these Goods, untill such last out-fitters just and legal Demand for the last outfit is completed, that so the last outfitter may at least be assured that the property is bound to him for payment unless fraudalently alienated by the Trader, in which case, as it would be difficult, if not impracticable to trace such Property, and besides contrary to every principle of justice, to oblige the Creditor thoe' of an old date, who may have bond fide received payment from his debtor, being an Indian Trader, to return the money so received, or that a bond fide purchaser of the Goods or Peltries arising therefrom, and who may have paid for the same to the satisfaction of the seller, should be compelled to pay a second time. But to prevent the Traders from paying away the Goods or produce of their last outfit, to the prejudice of men's wages, and their last outfitter's privileged claim, some degree of Punishment should be inflicted (more than on insolvent Debtors in general) or those who may wilfully and knowingly in discharge of their claims pay away or otherwise misuse the Goods or produce of their last outfit. And the rather as it it well known that Merchants fitting out Indian Traders are willing to be their sole Creditors. The Traders having therefore no complicated business, it is in their power to do the strictest Justice to the Merchants, which should they depart from, they must blame themselves for being the authors of their own Disgrace & Punishment. Itis not however understood, or wished for, that the Law should deprive an Indian

Trader (who by misfortune may become insolvent) from the Indulgence and Benefit of the Laws in general, on the contrary they ought to be protected as all others'in similar cases, against the violence of relentless creditors. Thus far relates to outfits made from Montreal and on a supposition that the Trader has not afterwards occasion to purchase anything further for the Purpose of his Trade, but it is otherwise for they cannot carry the Provisions necessary for the whole Voyage along with them, they must therefore buy at Michilimackinac; and further it frequently happens, that after having passed a winter in the country, they return to Michilimackinac with a considerable part of their Goodsxremaining, and then purchase goods anew, and it has been generally understood that such provisions and goods were (after men's wages) payable in preference te every other claim, but this custom seems, so far at least as relates to Merchandise, to be injurious to the Montreal outfitter, part of whose outfit being still on hand, it is but reasonable, that he should be intitled to a pioportion of the returns of the year following, but not to extend further as a privileged Creditor. Therefore it would be necessary to enact,That (after men's wages) Canoes, Guns, Bark & Provisions bought at Michilimackinac should be considered for their amount as payable in prefereuce to everything else, and with respect to goods advanced at that Post, where part of a former outfit remains, the new outfitter ought to take the precaution of having an Inventory made out upon the oath of the Trader of the Goods he has remaining and to be valuhied by two indifferent Persons, also upon Oath, which valuation to be considered as part of the new outfit and payable as such pro rata, and in default of this precaution that the Balance owing on account of the last outfit should be considered as part of the new, and entitled to benefit of Privilege as already mentioned of Goods remaining -Detroit. The foregoing remarks relate generally to the Trade carried on to Michilimackinac, and its dependencies, by way of the Grand River, and we are now to advert more particularly to the Trade above St. Regis, and as far as Detroit & the Country adjacent carried on by the communication of the Lakes. The same freedom of Trade as for Michilimackinac. The same means of obliging the Battoe-men to fulfill their Engagements and similar Punishment on such as wilfully fail or break through them. A preference Law in favor of a Last Outfitter from Montreal cannot be so well applied as in the trade to Michilimackinac, because the Business by the Communication of the Lakes comprehends an extensive Trade with the Inhabitants of many Settlements, and becomes too complicated to leave a possibility of determining how far the person outfitted may have applied or misused the returns of the outfit in discharge thereof

The Trade therefore to the new Settlements, and as far as the Post of Detroit can only be considered in the same light as in the Lower parts of the Province-touching the claims of different Creditors-But as the Indian Trade carried on from Detroit to the adjacent Country is limited in its nature, with equally great Risks as from Montreal to Michilimackinac, it is the opinion of this committee, that the Law of Privilege to last outfitters, should be in force with regard to all outfits made at Detroit for the Indian Trade. Judicial Establishment. For further facilitating and encouraging the Trade to the Upper Countries, and for the ease2 convenience, & advantage of His Majesty's Subjects settled in those parts, and for those Trading thereto, who might have actions to prosecute-It would become necessary to erect the Posts of Detroit and Michilimackinac into a separate District from that of Montreal to be divided and bounded by----------------------------------------------------- That a Court of Civil Juarisdiction should, be established therein, to be called the Court of Common pleas, with similar Powers, Jurisdiction and Authority as is invested in the Courts of Common Pleas now established in this Province, for the Determining all matters of controversy relative to Property and Civil Rights, excepting as is hereafter exceptedThat one Judge shall be sufficient to constitute such Court, whose Decisions should be final in all cases where the matter in Dispute should not exceed the sum of Fifty Pounds of Lawful Money of this Province, except in matters which might relate to the taking or demanding any Duty, payable to His Majesty, or to any Fee of office, or annual Rents, or other such like matters or thing where the Rights in future may be bound; in which cases & also in all matters that exceed the said value of Fifty Pounds of Lawful Money of this Province, an appeal should lie to the Court of iMontreal, provided security be duly given by the appelleat to-effectually prove the same and answer the condemnatioa with such Costs and Damages as might be awarded in case the Judgement should be affirmedThat the appeal ought not to be on the footing of appeals (as at present constituted) from the Courts of Common Pleas here, to the Court of Appeals, but should be in the nature of a new Trial; where the parties might be at Liberty to set forth the whole Justice of their Case, and adduce all evi

That on the proceedings of any cause being transmitted by the Judge from Michilimackinac to this Place, and being filed with the Clerk, the Parties thereupon shall be considered before the Court here, as much so, to all intents and Purposes, as if original process had issued thereout. Observation-The utility of this separate District with a civil Jurisdiction erected therein, is obvious to every Person residing in, or trading to those Posts, yet we consider it our Duty to point out more particularly the necessity of it to the Honorable Committee of Council. Detroit is become a settlement, both of great extent and great conseque nce, it annually fits out a vast trade to the Interior Posts circum-jacent to it, which in the course of carrying on, disputes and differences invariably arise, to determine which for the want of a judicial power on the spot, they are obliged to have resorts to the Courts at Montreal, where from the delay and expense occasioned by the great distance of one Place from the other, the suitor is generally more oppressed than benefitted; the great delay affords an opportunity to the Debtor of making away with his Property, and the Plaintiff thereby independant of the Loss of his Debt, becomes further saddled with the costs of suit. For instance the Merchant of Detroit sends to Montreal for a summons against some one of his Debtors at that Post, his Letter takes a month frequently coming down, the summons Issues and three months is the shortest space allowed for its return, and often according to the season, four, five and six months, is granted. The summons goes up, and by a special warrant from the Sheriff, some Ignorant Person is appointed to serve it, he commits an Error; so that when the writ is returned the Service is found defective, and the only Remedy then left to the Plaintiff is to begin again, this happens at least three times out of five, but if per chance the Summons is returned properly served, and that Judgment goes by Default, it then requires six months before the Property of the.Debtor can be seized upon at Detroit, by virtue of an execution issuing on a Judgment so obtained, and even when execution goes up, its of no avail, unless the Commanding Officer of the Post interferes, by affording Military Aid to enforce it. There is not less than forty suits a year (all above Ten Pounds Sterling) instituted here in this Court in the foregoing manner, by Persons residing at Detroit against others in the same place, out of which not above one fourth have the desired effect, besides the great expense for costs of suit of so much Importance and so great is the Trade, carried on to and from Detroit, that we believe a Judge there, would not have less than from Three to Four Hundred causes a year to Determine, including those above' as well as under Ten Pounds Sterling.

present state, they have no means to enforce payment from their Debtors, it is on their Honor and Honesty they must rely-a sorry dependance in a Country where there is neither a power to check or restrain the most disolute and Licentious morals. We therefore trust that Government will see the Policy of Granting a reasonable demand to a District of Country that owes no less than Two Hundred and Fifty Thousand Pounds Sterling to this Placefor if means are not given them to enforce the recovery of their Property, we cannot expect to be paid, and if we are not, the Loss ultimately falls on the Parent State. In these times of Public Oeconomy the expense attending such an Establishment may be made an objection; to this, we beg leave to observe that the quit-rents and other Revenues arising to the Crown at Detroit only, and heretofore taken and claimed as the Perquisites of the Lieut. Governor, or Commanding officer would nearly, ifnot fully, defray the expense of the Judicial Establishment demanded[Q 27, part I, page 326] CAPTAIN MCKEE TO SIR JOHN JOHNSON. DETROIT 25th February 1786 DEAR SIR, " At present our Information from the Indian Country is that most of the Nations from the other side of the Lake have at last been induced to attend the meeting with the American Commissioners at the mouth of the SGreat M iam is, in order to settle some amicable m easures, and to avoid extremeties till they can receive advice and assistance next year from their Father and the general Councils of the Indians; at the same time fully determined / not to enter into any Engagements respecting Lands, or listen to any proposals on this Head-We understand that they are still at the meeting, but have not as yet learned any particulars of their transactions. The Cherokees and Mingoes have refused entering into any negociations with them, and continue their Depredations on their Frontiers, and we hear that most of the Wabash Indians are in the same situation. I find that a number of chiefs from the several Nations will be disposed to go to Canada this Spring, as well from the invitation delivered to them in the name of the nations of Canada, as to be informed of their Fathers sentiments towards them, and what their hopes may be from him in future, as they still look towards him as the real support of their Interests. It is certain now tho'; that every art will be made use of at the present meeting to alienate their affections and remove their Dependance on us, but I

the principal design of the Commissioners being to obtain their consent to give up the Country, must destroy the confidence the Indians in every other respect, and I am informed they are gone prepared to withstand every attempt to lead them to an aclknowledgement of the American claims-It is beyond a doubt their greatest wish at present to receive some favorable sup-, port towards their right of the Country; this is the object that secures their Reliance on and attachment to us, which must continue while this is their expectation notwithstanding two horrid murders have been committed on four of. His Majesty's Subjects in the beginning of this Winter by Chipawa Indians of Sagana, a place noted for misbehaviour, the first on two men near this place, and the second on two others on their way to that Village, both perpetrated by the same Indians who are an old man and his two sons, one of the latter was killed by the white People in their defence at the last place, and it does not appear that any other Indians have been concerned or privy to this. flagrant Breach of Friendship, on the contrary the nations in general have declared their abhorrance of the action, and the Chiefs of the village they belong to, have engaged either to. deliver them up to Justice or put to Death themselves, but from the State of Society they live in coercive measures are seldom in practice, and then only after much deliberation, it will require some time, and as we have peremptorily demanded them, I hope before long they will be able to deliver them up, and restore tranquility and confidence as usual. I shall take the earliest opportunity of informing you of the Result of their Treaty, and in the mean time have the honor to be &c. (Signed) A. McKEE Sir John Johnson Bart Endorsed:-No 3.

and is extended over a Tract of Country reaching from the Latitude of 390 S. on the Mississippi to the North and West of Hudson's Bay in the Latitude of 60~ DegreesThat the Indians who occupy this vast tract of Country are of fierce and Warlike dispositions and unfortunately for the Traders, they are at present engaged in a cruel war with one another, which not only prevents them from hunting but exposes the Traders to great danger of their lives or the loss of their property when met by the war parties, whether in the course of the voyage or when in their Winter Habitations. That some attempts have been made to reconcile the jarring Nations, and at times the Traders when on the spot have so far succeeded as to keep them in Peace for a season; the good effects whereof were not less esteemed by the Indians than beneficial to the Traders as by that means the Indians remained unmolested on their respective wintering grounds which naturally produced a considerable degree of success & advantage to the Merchant, but lately the disputes of those Nations have arose to a height abpve the power of the Traders, assisted by the officer commanding at Michilimakinac to control or appease, in consequence whereof the Trade has suffered greatly and' unless some remedy is applied in time there is reason to fear the loss of a considerable part of that valuable branch of Commerce, in particular the whole of that carried on upon the Mississippi from the Illinois to its sourceYour Memorialists pray such aid and relief in the premises as to you may seem meet, respectfully suggesting the expedient of proper persons being employed to bring about a peace which no doubt will require considerable presents, but at same time will be greatly facilitated by the name of Sir John Johnson; a name well known amongst the Indians, much respected by them and always considered as the Harbinger of Peace to these Nations.

SP. Chaboiliez Auldjo & Maitland Gregory & Maitland John Bapt. Durocher G. Cotti Pollard & Mason [Q48 II page 360] MEMORANDUMS. No. 4. Memorandums for Sir John Johnson Baronet submitted to his consideration by the Committee of Merchants who had the honor of presenting to him a Memorial dated 4th April relative to the Indian Trade. The Indian Nations who are at War with one another, to the great prejudice of the Trader are the Otctawas, the Chippeways, the Fallisavoines, the Winipigoes or picants-The Osakies-the Ontagamies or Foxes & the SciouxTo bring about a peace amongst these Indians, considerable presents will be necessary, and in order to judge of the necessary quantums, it may be proper to mention the number of men in each Nation with their situation in the Country and the means that may be adopted to effect that purpose.The Ottawas consist of nearly- Men and are situated along the south and east side of Lake Michigan, beginning at the distance of eight leagues from Michilimackinac, and extending nearly to the River St. Joseph, but being immediately under the eye of the Commandant of Michilimackinac from whom it is presumed they receive presents, no account will be made of them in speaking of those which will be thought necessary for the present purpose. It is proper however to observe, that they are a Nation much respected by all the others, therefore their friendship may be rendered serviceable in any transactions with the others. "Tlhe Chpeways 800 men. A few of them are around Lake Huron & at Michilimackinac but by far the most numerous and warlike part (and to whom the present remark more particularly alludes) inhabit the south side of Lake Superior, from the Falls of St. Mary. to the west end of that Great Lake with the Country adjacent and.a very numerous tribe of them occupy the sources of the Mississippi with all the Country on the East side of that famous River, so low as the River of the Chipeways, which falls into the Mississippi about the Latitude of 401 North. This tract cannot be surpassed or perhaps equalled by any in the

Upper Country for the fine furrs it produces, but owing to the vicinity of the Scioux and the constant war between these rival Nations, the Traders, do not procure from it one forth part of the furrs, which it is capable of producing annually. The number of men fit to bear arms of this Nation from St. Mary's to the sources of the Mississippi and in the Country described cannot fall much under eight hundred.Manominis or Follisavoines 150 men. The prosecuting the Voyage from Michilimackiriac to the Mississippi by the direct and short road of La Bay the Manominis are the first nation you meet with they are in two fixed and considerable Villages, one at the River Manomini, the other at La Bay, and there are some straggling huts along the River Renard, the whole number of men fit to bear Arms, may be near one hundred and fifty and at present they are at war with the Chipeways, they are esteemed excellent Huntsmen and are not less known for their Intrepidity in War.Winipigoes or Pzcants 600 men. This nation is the next to the Manominis, their first Village being only twelve leagues from La Bay, they are at present at War with the Chipeways, are Warlike and tolerable Hunterp and from being on the road to the Mississippi are frequently troublesome to the Traders passing and repassing. Osakies or Sacs 1,300 men. A Nation which inhabited a few years ago the banks of the River Wisconsing but owing to their apprehensions of the Chipiwas and being rather of a peaceable turn they left their Villages and went a considerable way down the Mississippi, where they continue to reside and mostly on the Spanish side, this Nation is at present at war with the Scioux of the plains and the Spaniards are using endeavours to attach them to their Interest, and even to bring them nearer to them, but the superiority of the Canadian Traders hath hitherto prevented it.Outagamies or Foxes 1,400 men. This nation is nearly allied to the Sacs, speak almost the same language, inhabit the same country, are esteemed rather more troublesome hunt and trade as the Sacs and at present are at war with the Chipeways, who inhabit the Sources of the Wisconsing, and the other Rivers which fall into the east' side of the Mississippi. Scioux 3,000 men. This Nation is so numerous ahd extended over so great a tract of Country that the Traders can neither give a just account of the one or description of S-r

the other, but they esteem, that at various times, they have seen not less than 3006 of different tribes- They occupy the plains on the west side of the Mississippi from the River Manaquanon to the Sources of almost the first of those Rivers and are esteemed War like and fierce but are not very good hunters owing to their Country being stocked with Buffaloe and the little intercourse they have with the Traders (of late however they are become more industrious, and the best Deerskins with a deal of Beaver and Otters are now obtained from them) in particular from those who inhabit the Country along the River St Pierre and the Upper Parts of the Mississippi about the Falls of St Anthony, that being a Country which rivals the eastern parts occupied by the Chipeways for the goodness and value of the furrs whlich it produdes, the country too is very extensive that when peace can be brought about, between these two fierce and rival nations, the Manominis, the Picants, the Sakies, and the Foxes go up into that country and make most prodigious Hunts; but whilst they continue at war no Indians nor Trader can shew themselves in that Country with safety. Having taken notice of the number of men in those nations.who are at war and the situation of those Indians; we proceed to state such presents as in our opinion may be requisite to bring peace amongst them, and the consequent benefits that will be derived from it. With respect to the presents we must request Sir John Johnson's reference to the annexed state; and as to the benefit's which may arise from a peace being established, there can be no doubt that the Traders present risque will be much lessened by it, and an ample field for commerce assured; two objects which merit consideration, besides the prevention of a cruel war between these fierce Tribes. To carry this Scheme into execution is thought that several persons must be employed to carry the parcels and distribute the presents-for the Chipeways Messrs Cadot & Rheum are proper persons-For the Ottawas, the Fallisavoines, the Picants, the Sakies and Foxes, Mr. Ainse-but as a Scioux Interpreter will be requisite Messrs Rocque & Rainville will be very serviceable, and as many of the Sacks & Foxes may winter in the lower parts of the Mississippi, it may be necessary to employ Mr. Gautier to reside with them. It may be proper to send as early as possible strings of Wampum to the different nations, desiring them to remain quiet and informing them at the same time, that their father Sir John Johnson, being desirous to put an end to their disputes, is to send them early in the fall Belts and presents for that purpose, mentioning also such places of Rendezvous as may be thought most proper-for instance-for the Chipewas, La pointe, Fond du Lao and Lac du Sable, some Ottawas, the Follisavoines and picants to accompany Mr. Ainse to prairie du Chien, there to meet the Sakies and Foxes and if possible some

Sioux to be present, from thence to proceed to the River St Pierre and there hold a grand Council, deliver the paroles, the Belts and the presents. In order to save expence to the person in carrying the presents from Michilimakinac into the interior Country-each of the Traders Canoes ought to carry three or four pieces, but it will necessary that one Canoe at least carry nothing but presents into the Mississippi and another into Lake SuperiorThe presents should be delivered in the presence of the Traders to the Indians and particular mention should be made, that all Traders being children of the same Father they have all equally right and priviledge to traffick with their Brothers the Indians, it might be proper to retain part of the presents until Spring, particularly Rum, silver-work, some Coats, hats, shirts, Flags and Medals.

SIR, From the great resort of Indians even from the most distant nations to the post of Michilimackinac from the extensive trade carried on from thence, and from its consequent importance; but particularly from the great expense that has hitherto attended the conducting the business of the Indian Department at that Post I have thought it necessary for the good of His Majesty's Service that you should repair to that station-and I do hereby require that you do without loss of time and in the most expeditious manner return to Niagara with the Indian Goods destined for the several posts, and from thence you are to proceed in the first vessel next Spring, the Season being now too far advanced, to Michilimackinac to take upon you the management of Indian affairs in that District, for your guidance in which Captain Byrne the present Commissary of Indian affairs, whose appointment must cease on the 24th June 1787, will deliver over to you all such orders as he received and were found necessary for that purposeIn consequence of an unfortunate War raging among some of the Western Nations, & at the request of the Merchants trading to that Country I have taken some steps to endeavor to reconcile them to each other by sending out a Messenger among them to desire that they would desist from all acts of hostility and assemble some of the Chiefs of each Nation next June at Michilimackinac, where I shall endeavour to meet them and to establish a lasting peace, to facilitate which I intend to take with me or order round by Detroit some of the Chiefs of the Six Nations-But should I from unforseen accident or business be prevented from putting my intentions into execution, you will take such steps as you wiil find necessary to accomplish this desirable business, in the interim you will continue to act in conjunction with Lt.

tr. Dease addressed the Nations present as follows: Children, It is with much pleasure I see so many of you assembled here in council to-day in consequence of your Father Sir John Johnsons Speech & Belt delivered to you by Mr. Ainse-In our former meetings I have fully explaiped to you the motives that engag'd your Father Sir John Johnson to send me here. I mentioned to you also his determination to attend the Council in person, in order to restore to his children that peace and harmony to which they have been too long strangers, and the want of which has been the cause of so niuch misery to them, by letters I lately received from him, I have some reasons to think that the critical situation of your elder Brothers the Six Nations, and other business of consequence respecting them, may engage him so long, as to prevent his coming here, as the season is advancing fast, and you have represented to me the great distance to your homes and your wishes to return as soon as the very interesting business on which you are come shall be finished. As his representative here I called you together in order to comply with his instructions, by establishing peace and friendship among the nations who have been long at war, and by that means securing to them tranquility and happiness. Children, You have in a very feeling manner described to me the miserable situation you were in when Sir John Johnson's Belt & Speech were delivered to you, your country a continual scene of desolation, Your lodges destroyed, your old men, women and children the bleeding victims of a horrid war, these Fields which by cultivation should have yielded them support, barren and stained with the blood of your own people, your hunting and fishing neglected, and the miserable remains of your women and children perishing of famine through your madness and folly, this was your wretched condition when your father's belt was shewn to you, his speech awakened yon to a sense of madness, opened your eyes to see your folly, and your ears to hear what was for your good, 'twas then that you were able to discover the pleasantness of the road he traced out for you, 'twas then that a clear Sky and comfortable Sunshine succeeded to the black clouds and dreadful thunder that roared over your heads, 'twas then you began to taste the pleasure of attending with security to your Hunting andTFishing (those sources of plenty for yourselves and families) your sleep was no longer interrupted by the apprehension of lurking enemies, theseowere a part of the blessihgs you enjoyed by attending to your Father's CouncilChildren, Fully sensible of your past misconduct, and the severe punishment the Great Spirit had in his anger inflicted on you, you in compliance with your Fathers desire are come to bury deep the war ax, that source of all your

Here the Articles were read aloud and explained to them. Children, Peace being established among yourselves according to your own Customs, you have now heard the Articles which regard your conduct towards the King and his white Children read and explained to you, as you have already assured me of your unanimous approbation of them, it only now remains that you should acknowledge in the most public and solemn manner that these Articles are in future to be binding in yourselves and the Nations you represent, and their posterity whilst the sun and moon shall remain, this you will do by the Village and War Chiefs, deputies from the different nations lately at War, advancing and laying their hands on the Seals opposite their names, declare and ratify their agreement & approbation of the articles already explained to them and contained in that paper.

Our old men, women and dhildren will be now comfortably cloath'd, we particularly thank you for this large bundle of netts on which we can place our principal dependance for our subsistance we gratefully acknowledge this distinguished mark of your Bounty, such a one we have not heretofore experienced. Father, A few days past we spoke to you about our Nephew Ainse, that he might remain with us, we have since been informed that our distsnt brethren has requested that he might come amongst them once more, to confirm what he had almost accomplished, this is a business we have much at heart, and to prove how much we desire to accommodate ourselves to the wishes of our Father, we would be glad he would point out such persons of our Nation, as he would chuse to accompany him and they shall be ready to attend himFather, You desire our confidence and that we should conceal nothing from you, your children must obey you, we tell you that our Village was not lately the most peacably inclined among the nations, we had Sons for which we wanted a Medicine, here is a War Belt sent to us three months ago by Chamblie to invite us to revenge the deaths of four of his people who were killed by the Orages at the Illinois, determined to follow the advice of our Father deliver'd to us by Mr. Ainse, we sent back for answer that as soon as our father should signify his intentions to us, we should know what to say, that until then, we were not masters of our own inclinationsDelivered up the Belt to Mr. DeaseFather, We must trespass a little longer on your patience to whom but to a father should his children disclose their griefs, the following circumstance makes us very unhappy, & often prevents our visiting your posts as often as we would wish, Father, since we have been under the protection of the Great King of England.

well received at, every house, we sold our things and got Credits where we pleas'd, each of us had our particular friends who were glad to see us and cheerfully permitted us to smoke our pipes or warm ourselves by their fire side, but now it is quite the reverse, there is but one trading House at Michilimakinac and that seldom open for our reception, we often go to that house and teturn in the same manner we came, this change can't please us, it makes us very unhappy, therefore we apply to our father to find a remedy for it and relieve usFather, We have not sufficient understanding to hold a longer conversation with y6u, we now take you cordially by the hand intreating you will please to continue your care of 'us, and we sincerely promise you on our part, that should any bad Birds pass on any part of this Lake or on our Land that we will give you the earliest information of it or of any thing else that would be interesting to youFather, We will now make a just distribution of your Bounty and in the Evening when regaling with the provisions you have brought us, drink large draughts of the milk you gave to our Father Sir John Johnson's health and yoursMr. Dease spoke to them as followsChildren, I have attentively heard what you have said, and thank you for the kind manner in which you bid me welcome, after the conclusion of my business at Makinac & took the first opportunity of fulfilling my promise to you, and the pleasure I have to-day in seeing so many of my children assembled, fully repays any trouble I might have in coming here-The ravages of time are not confined to your nation alone, the greatest Empires decrease and of many scarce even the remembrance remains, the barrenness of your plains & the scarcity of game in your woods can be only remedied by the increased industry of your young men, your Lakes are a neverfailing source of plenty, whilst instead of war you steadily pursue these objects, you will be happy in yourselves and render your wives and children so by supplying their wantsChildren, Your Fathers intention in lighting the fire and placing those Belts here is (as I have already informed you) to renew the remembrance of your former engagements or the promises you made Sir Wm. Johnson they are placed here at the Door of the Western Nations as Memorials to remind not yourselves alone but also the nations that pass here and even your posterity of the past transactions, on the observance of which your welfare and happiness depend, this Council fire must never be disgraced by the presence of any persons who might whisper bad things to you, that might mislead you from your attachment to the Great King your father

ASSURANCES.

Children, The gracious bounty and goodness of our Great King has induced him (through your Father Sir John Johnson) to find you those supplies, I hope your attachment to himself, your attention to your Father's Councils and your good conduct towards his white children will incline him to continue his protection, I have no doubt that your young men will make a proper and successful use of their Arms, Ammunition and fishing implements- - Children, You were present when your distant Brethren in the most earnest manner in treated Mr. Ainse should return among them. I hope in the course of the ensuing winter he will be able to confirm such a peace among them as has been heretofore often attempted without success, such a peace cannot fail of proving highly advantageous to the Indian Nations in general, l am well acquainted with the particulars of the accident that happened Chamblies people, I must candidly tell you they were much to blame and drew on themselves the fate they met with, they have not two fathers, they had no business with the Spanish Commanding Officer from visiting whom they were returning when the Orages killed four of them, to attempt to avenge their deaths would be to make bad worse, I nevertheless thank you for delivering up this War Belt, experience will certainly convince you that my advice to you are entirely calculated to promote your own welfare-! Children, My Ears are always open to hear you, I am stationed at Michilimakinac to see Justice done in what respects you, that general store that at present ingrosses the Trade of Michilimakinac and which for some time past has prevented it being divided thro' different houses will soon be disolved, and then I make no doubt Commerce will be carried on as heretofore and I shall take care you shall have no just cause of complaint, the King has been graciously pleased to send us a Commander in Chief whose Justice penetrates even to the remotest Nations and whose inclination will leave no grievance unredressedChildren, I now with much pleasure take you by the hand assuring you that the proceedings of this day have given me much satisfaction, I trust in your promises that you will watch carefully and prevent any bad birds from hovering over this lake or its shores, and depend if such should happen that you will give me early and particular information of it, I shall by the first vessel acquaint your father Sir J. Johnson with the particulars of this meeting with which I hope he will be pleasedRecommending you to a prudent use of your provisions and particularly your father's milk and returning you thanks for your intended Compliment to Sir John Johnson and myself I take my leave[Q 48 p II page 382]

NO I. BEING THE REPRESENTATION OF SUNDRY MERCHANTS AND TRADERS AT MIOCHILIMAKINAO TO CAPT. THOS. SCOTT OF THE 53d REGIMENT, COMMANDANT OF THAT POST DATED THE 10th OF AUGUST 1787, AS FOLLOWS. Being unanimously convinced of your favorable attention to Commerce, in conforAnity with the good will of His Excellency Lord Dorchester, we take the liberty of addressing to you our just subjects of complaint on a very important subject, contrary to commerce in general and incompatible with the favorable intentions of Government. In the year 1785, several merchants of Montreal, convinced of the damage that would be caused to us by the misunderstanding existing between several Indian Nations, had applied to Sir John Johnson, General Inspector of the Indian Department, a request which asks him to make a peace among these militant nations and to send the goods necessary to conclude a solid and durable peace amongst them. The Government sensible of our Interests and desiring te encourage our commerce has granted all, and yet we find unfortunately that the intention of Government has been absolutely frustrated, that the distribution and pernicious use of its goods have been as contrary to its views as opposed to our interests. We know that the goods destined as presents to the Indians have been privately traded against our interests, and that the store established for the protection of Commerce has become itself a trading post entirely opposed to our interest. We believe that the peace has been concluded among the Indians, it is useless to send them goods, that in sending them to the Indians under this specious pretext, they would be traded to our great prejudice, many clerks and Interpreters engaged for this purpose and payed in Government goods, shows us a trade visibly established; the considerable losses which we have experienced last winter, by fewer goods being sent off than the present, losses caused'by the report and letters of King's Interpreters and otherwise, necessarily give us just apprehension for this year. An unlucky experience has convinced us that the intentions of Government not being followed in the distribution of these Goods, gives the Indians a just subject for discontent. The Interpreters have received their presents, having engaged them to come to this post by flattering promises, and, after a long and tedious journey, they saw their hopes frustrated and were treated so that they returned very discontented. We take the liberty of testifying to you our surprize that persons employed for the Indian Department and the protection of commerce are opposed to 63

all the advantages which we could obtain from it; in the first place in depriving us of the liberty of speaking to the Indians, publickly and in general, on that which concerns our interests. Rights that we have been accorded by His Excellency Lord Dorchester, according to our permits, and by all the Commandants in this post till now-Secondly, in taking goods to be traded in this post, with the Indians, at a very low price, and to which we could not conform without a considerable loss. It is not without having made representations that we have suffered this last loss, but they have thought it sufficient to answer us that the King's Goods would be lent when and to whom it seemed good. We flatter ourselves, Sir, that you will present our representations to His Excellency Lord Dorchester, considering that the continual abuse of the favors of Government for our trade, will force us, if it is not repressed, to cease absolutely. As experience proves to us that these abuses are nearly inevitable in the Upper Country, that the goodness and protection of Government being frustrated, they become contrary to their favorable intentions. We believe that it is more advantageous for us that no goods be sent to the Indians by Government. We have the Honor to be Sir, Your very humble & very obedient Servants. (signed). Frs. Le May, A.

AN ADDRESS OF THE MERCHANTS & TRADERS ABOVE MENTIONED TO HIS EXCELLENCY LORD DORCHESTER DATED THE 14TH AUGUST 1787 IN THE WORDS FOLLOWING. To His Excellency the most Honorable Guy Lord Dorchester, General & Governor in Chief of the Colonies of Quebec, Nova Scotia, & New Brunswick & their dependances, Vice-Admiral of the same, General & Commander in Chief of all His Majesty's Troops in the said Colonies, & in the Island of Newfoundland, &c. &c. &c. * *. * ' ^

PROPOSED POLICY.

My Lord, The undersigned Merchant Traders, of the post of Michilimackinao, excited by the considerable loss which their trade is now suffering, in general, take the liberty of pointing it out to Your Excellency. Having addressed our inclosed request, to Capt. Scott Commandant in this post, praying him to transmit it to Your Excellency. Mr. Dease, being interested himself, in asking Capt. Scott, that, before sending it to Your Excellency, he should name qualified persons to examine our just subjects of complaint. Although we do not doubt the intelligence & integrity of the persons chosen, we have not been able to consent to submit to their opinions, seeing -that they have not a sufficient knowledge of the nature of our Trade with the Indians. Encouraged by the particular protection of Your Excellency, we have preferred to address you directly, we flatter ourselves that it would be well to continue it, in consideration of our respectful representation & we will not cease to pray for the preservation of Your Excellency. [Q 48 I page 127] NO. 2. EXTRACTS FROM MR. DEASES JOURNAL FOR THE YEAR 1787. June 28. I communicated to Mr. Paterson and the directors of the Gen'l Store my intention of holding a General Council with the Indians who came in with Mr. Ainse when I propose concluding a peace with the different Nations lately at war with each other, in doing which after impressing them with sentiments of Attachment & Gratitude to the Kings Service on account of his protection and the annual marks they receive of his gracious goodness to them. I would in the next place consult'the Interest of the Traders to that part of the Country and use every endeavour to establish it on a liberal and permanent footing, by inducing the Indians to agree to insert such articles as would seem most conducive to the good of the commerce of this post for which purpose I requested Mr. Paterson to acquaint the Traders here that I would be glad they would consider a subject so highly interesting to them, & as people well acquainted with the matter give me their sentiments in writing thereon previous to the Great Council where I intended to proceed in such a manner as I hoped would prove satisfactory. They met in the Evening at Kirby's when both in French and English I explained to them my intentions for which having expressed their thanks they departed? much satisfied and promised to consider the subject recommended to them. July 3rd. The Indians all expressed the strongest desire that Mr. Ainse might be sent amongst them once more to compleat what he had already

begun and several of them declared that unless they obtained their request they feared that all that been already done would be to no purpose, that they wanted such a man to remind them of their father's words and give them good council. 4th. About 11 O'Clock met the Chiefs of the different Nations in Council their Speeches much to the same purpose all insisting or rather intreating to send Mr. Ainse among them again. July 5th. Met the Ohippaways & Ottawas in Council their Speeches much the same as the former, they also requested to have Mr. Ainse sent among them. 9th. Captain Scott presented me a Speech of Mr. Paterson's to be delivered to the Indians to which I objected as contrary to my duty, he seemed much displeased. 23rd. Promised the Scioux to send Mr. Ainse to winter among them in presence of Capt. Scott and the Gentlemen of the Garrison who attended the Council which lasted 2 hours. August 11. Capt. Scott sent for me to shew me a Representation or rather misrepresentation given to him this morning by the Clerks or Merchants of the General Stores respecting the Indian Department setting forth how injurious Mr. Ainse going into the Indian Country last winter had been to * their trade and their apprehensions from his retuining there this next winter -also that Goods had been lent to Individuals from the King's Store who traded, them at a low price. That the Indians went away very dissatisfied from this post, that Clerks and Interpreters were paid out of the King's Store to the ruin of their Trade, that they were refused permission to speak to the Indians concerning their Trade altho' permitted by Lord Dorchester's passes giving as their opinion that it would be unnecessary to send up in future any presents for the Indians and a good deal of such stuff signed by a number of ' that General Society. Mr. Deaso having read the paper given him by Capt Scott, observed that their charges amounted to no more than mere assertions unsupported by any evidence that as he entertained no doubt that the Genlm would substantiate them before a Court of Enquiry, Mr. Dease intreated Capt. Scott to order one for that purpose, to which he agreed and imagined it would be proper to have some Civilians present of whom I might appoint one and the General: store another and they in 8onjunction with the officers of the Garrison should make the Enquiry, I then requested a copy which Capt. Scott promised after the trial-Capt. Scott acquainted Mess"s Paterson and Campion with his instructions, to which they objected and withdrew the papers in order to send them

Scott immediately told me their determination of not submitting to a court of Enquiry, on which I remarked that it would probably end in that, and that perhaps when it would be much more expensive to Govermt and when it -would be impossible to colleot the parties concerned. I then requested as before in the morning a Copy of this Representation in order to enable me regularly to confute the charges therein contained, this I could not obtdin, the Representation being withdrawn by' Mess" Campion and Patterson on my return home I wrote to the Directors of the general Store requesting the favor of a copy of the representation given to Capt. Scott, relying on their candor and liberality, this they also refused-I then applied to Capt. Scott for a Court of Enquiry respecting the charges contained in the Representation that those accused might have an opportunity of proving the falsehood of their assertions and vindicate their own Characters-this Capt. Scott denied saying he would have nothing more to do in the business. I fancy an impartial person would look on us to be hardly used and it is impossible that in future we shall have so good an opportunity of exposing both the malice and falsehood of their information-the people able to prove both I offered to bring before Capt. Scott, whom I entreated to have them sworn and examined-this he would not comply with alledging that he could not administer an Oath as he was not a Justice of peace, I told him I imagined him one in virtue of his command here. 14th. 500 more packs sent down this year than last besides those that are to go.

SIR, According to the orders which I received last' year from Captain Byrne I left this Post with a Canoe loaded with thirteen bales of goods to go and make peace among the Indian Nations. After a fortnight's passage I arrived at La Baye in the Village of the Folles Avoines, I began to speak to the nation & inform them of the object of my visit. I made them a small present of Rum & Goods & continued my

Having come to Wisconsin Portage I assembled all the Puants to give them your speech, this was the first time that I had showed the large Belt of which you had made me the bearer & after making them a present of Goods, rum & tobacco, I continued my route on the River Wisconsin & after a passage of five days I came, in the Mississippi to a village of the Foxes where I had much trouble in stopping a party of warriors, who were preparing to go to war against the Sauteux. I made them all assemble & managed to stop this party, myself delivering the belt & war tomahawk which they were to use. They promised that for the future they would -listen to your words, & also in acknowledgement I made them a present, the same as I had done to the others. Two days afterwards I prepared to leave, ascended the Mississippi & after fourteen days march I arrived at the entrance of the River St. Peter, where I found a large number of Sioux of all the different Villages who also prepared to go to war against the Sauteux. It was there that the few goods given me by Captain Byrne received a bad attack for I could not dispense with making a present to each of the five different Villages, that is where I made use of your name and I venture to flatter myself that I employed it in the best manner for I succeeded in everything. At that time a party of Sioux arrived coming from the Sauteux with sixteen fresh scalps & three prisoners. The arrival of this party caused a little interruption to the peace which I proposed, seeing that the larger part of the women tore the still bloody & ragged scalps from hands of the warriors, with an unequalled ferocity & wanted also to throw themselves upon the warrior prisoners, crying: "Ah dog; Is it thou who has killed my father," & another made the same exclamation saying "Is it thou who hast killed my brother." In short the three poor prisoners witnessed this sad spectacle which was the cause of so much bad feeling. But fortunately for those living in this neighborhood the plan of having good soldiers, who I can assure you are more respected than among the civilized nations, is in force. However they got possession of the prisoners, with trouble as they had to drag them from the hands of the women & preserved them from their rage. Although so sad a spectacle made a little confusion among us still I succeeded in quieting them by representing to them to what misery they would expose their Nation if they were obstinate & would not hear your speech, It was then one of the principal chiefs came & took me by the hand & wrapped a Beaver robe round me, saying "My Father rest until to-morrow & then we will tell you our way of thinking." The next day being all reassembled they sent to look for me by six of their soldiers, placed me on a beaver robe in the midst of their assembly, saying in very strong terms & informing me of their gratitude to their father Chevallier Johnson for wishing to bring about a peace amongst them & to unite their lands with those of their enemies.

They then made me a present of 50 stalks of wild oats & delivered to me the Sauteux prisoners which they had taken, saying, "As a proof that we listen to your words, here are the prisoners which 'we took into our hands take them to our father Sir John Johnson." I arranged all those affairs as well aÃ½ I could desire & brought them to make peace with the Sauteux. I then began to take courage & almost pursuaded of accomplishing your orders in full. So I continued my route, penetrating even as high as the River'St. Peter through all the Sioux Villages, with your large belt without any interruption & when I came to the last village I met a party of three hundred Sioux who were coming to war with the Saufeux. I stopped this party there with a present, some chiefs coats, a medal & a flag, which I gave them from you. After great difficulty however I succeeded in stopping them & getting them to make peace. I proposed to them that they should go among the Sauteux with a pipe of peace, which I gave them from you, to smoke in and to conclude the peace. As the season was then well advanced & as the ice prevented me from advancing farther; I left my canoe with four of my men & set off to traverse the Country on foot with two Escabias & an Interpreter, judging rightly that it was necessary to do the same among the Sauteux as I had just done among the Sioux. I left three days afterwards and, after having marched for seventeen days across the prairies, I arrived at the head of the St. Antoine Falls in the upper part of the Mississippi in the Sauteux Country. I went into the Village of the ManonimiRechi, I told them all that I had done among the Sioux, with regard to them. It was then nearly forty days since a party of Sioux had killed sixteen person in this village & made three prisoners as I have already mentioned. I remained all the rest of the winter going from Village to Village talking with the Sauteux & deciding them to make the peace which their father Sir John Johnson wished them to terminate. And after having spoken to all the Sioux, Sauteux, Follesavoines & Renards I appointed them to meet nearly ten leagues in the River St. Peter on the fourteenth of March, each of these nations kept their word & I Left myself for the place where I had said I would receive them. We passed eight days & eight nights continually in conference with one another & finally we arrived at the day of the great feast of peace, after which each went to his own village promising me that six men of the principal village chiefs & also war chiefs would come to Michilimakinac. I agreed with them that I would leave for the River St. Peter on the first of May & we gave our words to each other that whichever first came to the said place on the River St. Peter would wait for the others. All this was accomplished & the day agreed upon I left to go to the Prairie du Chien, where I arrived without any accident, but on our arrival there we

were not so well received by the Foxes as I could have wished. On the eve of my arrival I sent a canoe to announce me in the Fox village & to prevent all accidents I warned, by a letter which I wrote to Mr. 0. Paterson, Director of the society as well as the other traders, to stop the rum during my stay at the Prairie du Ohien. Immnediately on my arrival I lost no time in assembling all the Foxes, Sacks, Follesavoines, Sioux & Sauteux & did all in my power to unite their hearts which were then very much at variance. Having got the word of the Foxes," willing in spite of themselves, through the frequent councils which I held with them daring the four days I remained there, I concluded to leave the fifth day well foreseeing that if I stayed longer I would not have the power to prevent the danger which threatened me. The English Traders, who had never deigned to answer my letter nor to disturb themselves much about the trouble I endured among the different nations, enemies to one another, still sent the rum as usual, & all my labours were on the verge of being destroyed by the ambition of trade in so critical a time. The day I proposed to leave was the day that Mr. Paterson assembled the Sioux & held a Council with them, without my knowledge & I was greatly surprised on their return from Mr. Paterson's that the greater part wished to leave me & return home. I tried to find out what was said at this Council but I could discover nothing except through a clerk named La Batte. I asked him what Mr. Paterson could have said to the Indians that made the greater part want to return home. He then plainly said to me " Mr. Ainse as I was present at the Council I can assure you that Mr. Paterson said nothing but good to the Indians, having said that he was master of Trade & that he was going to send to have two forts built among them, also saying to them it is true that your father Sir John Johnson is a great man but it is not in his power to send me among you if I did not wish it. Believe me, it is I, who am a Trader, that can take care of you & send you all you need." I did not hold a long discourse with him well seeing that it would not be good for me to stay here long. I had all the Canoes put into the water & left in pretty bad order to go & camp about three leagues farther down. The same evening I sent some messengers with twenty branches of porcelaine to bring back L'Aile Rouge (Red Wing) first war chief of the Sioux & many others who wished to accompany him home. I succeeded in bringing them back & continued my route as far as Michilimakinac without any interruptionI was not surprised at the Declaration of Mons'. La Batte, about Mr. Charles Paterson's conduct, since he had already, in the upper part of the River St. Peter, taken upon him to make a Chief & given him a coat& flag; that was why the great Chiefs of the Tinctons Villages as well as the great ' ^ ' ' ' "'<-^ i ii

CONCLUSION OF TRANSACTIONS.

Chiefs of the Cicitton had not come to Michilimakinac, as they had promised after having received Sir John Johnson's speech. Altogether I had six men of each different village, I had then with me one hundred and ninety six persons and as many more I had sent over by Lake Superior, having appointed them a rendevous for the second of July on my arrivai at Michilimakinac. Therefore I hope Sir that anyone might know by my conduct and by all the precautions which I took that my only ambition was to work for the public good and to save the expenses of the Indian Department as much as lay in my power, although it is not possible on so long a voyage and conducting so large a number of Indians to avoid incurring some expense, God grant Sir that my conduct be as you wish! and that you are satisfied with my work, as far as was in my power to make valuable among the nations the few talents I possessed the employment of which you had been good enough to charge me with. I have sacrificed every moment since my departure from you. I then came to Michilimakinac in the hope of seeing you there. I found in your place Captain Dease. I had nothing more pressing than to attend to his orders and give him an account of my voyage. He appeared very well satisfied with my conduct and willing to give effect to all the words that I had given on your part to all the nations. I may say that Captain Dease was the proper person to achieve this work, and I flatter myself that all has been arranged to his wishes; he has made peace with all the nations which I brought here and I assure you that all the Indians have returned bome as contented as anyone could wish. But unhappily for me this was on condition that I would return again among them for a year. They have even fixed my winter quarters in the upper part of the Mississippi among the Sioux and Sauteux. Although so long a voyage would be repugnant to me I feared, Sir, to displease you if I refused Captain Deases orders, in consequence I prepared two canoes to return and take the management of all your Indian children in the South. But in the hope Sir, that you would permit me to return next year to Canada, where I would be able to render account myself of my conduct. I will give you no detail of the bad treatment which I received in this place from the Traders. I will leave this to Mr. Dease who will give you an exact account. I can only assure you Sir that the high opinion which they had of me when they addressed themselves to Your Honor and 'asked you to send me to make peace among the nations was a plan on their part. They doubtless depended that I would do as the others had done before me who for small trips have led the department into extraordinary expenses. Is it then possible to believe that, with thirteen small bales of goods that I had brought with me and which I had received from Captain Byrne, I could 64

"RELATIVE TO MEMORIAL.

speak to all the different villages and that I should be mistaken in having made the treaty with the Indians. I hope Sir that your opinion will alone be my judge and that justice will plead my cause on this occasion. It is true that I bought a little tobacco and wheat-to send to the Indians at Michilimakinac but this was indispensibly necessary. Now that I have given you an exact detail of my conduct it only rests with me to give you the numbers in the different villages I passed. 1st village of Arbre Croche-------------------------------- 260 men The villages of the Puants altogether ----------------------- 340 " The village of the Foxes.--------------------------------- 300 " The villages of the Saques -------------------------------- 700 " 1st village of the Sioux.-----------------------------------204 " 2nd " " " --------------------------------- 230 " 3rd " " " ------------- ----------------- 60 " The Sioux of the Feuille Fire ---------------------------- 200 " The large village of the Sioux called the Tinctons-------------800 " 3,294 It is not possible to give you the number of tho Sauteux seeing that they are never settled in their place, and that one can never see them all together but I can say for certain that they are more numerous than the Sioux.

A. He was told by the French Traders in that River, that Mr, Ainse told them, that they were fools to listen either to him or Mr. Charles Paterson, who were at the head of the Company's business, and by that means Mr. Ainse got a considerable number of Otters from these people which were the property of the Company-In the Spring of the year when the Chipeway Indians came to St. Peter's River to hold Council with the Scioux, Mr. Ainse called the Council with the Chipeways and the Scioux without acquainting him, he the deponant sent for Mr. Rocque out of the Council, as he was his Interpreter and forbad him, on pain of losing his wages, to interpret for any one unless he was present, Mr. Rocque went and told Mr. Ainse the above, upon which Mr. Ainse sent for him to the Council -After the Council was over, Mr. Ainse came to him and asked him his reasons for preventing Mr. Rocque's interpreting, unless he was present, that he would show him, that he would take his Interpreters and make them Interpret for him when he chose whether he was present or not He the deponant said, that if he did, he would make him pay their wages, but that Mr. Ainse never did make them interpret without asking him.

After they were stopped if they did not go to Mr. Aird's & take credits from him for to go and speak again to the Sicitons for to get a passageA.

Whether he does not think the Trade in the River St. Peter in 1786, 1787 would not have been better, had Mr. Ainse not been in that Country

A. Q. A.

He thinks it would have been a great deal better, if Mr. Ainse had not been in the River, both last year and this yearIf he does not think there would have been more Farrs got from that Country and the Indians as well satisfied as they are at present. Yes. What are his reasons for thinking so. The Indians lost a great part of their Fall hunt uniting with Mr. Ainse, because the Fall is the time of the year the Scioux hunt, for after the Snow falls they hunt but little, only to live, Mr. Ainse had his particular friends among the Scioux, which he gave the greatest part of his goods to, particularly the Couillon Rouge, who had more than ten, any others in general, which caused a jealosy among them and made them much dissatisfied, and that they complained very much for losing their fall hunt, waiting for their father's parole, but they could not pay their credits, nor clothe themselves, that was the reasons the Indians gave him when he went to drawn in the company's credits. How much did he and the Company's Clerks get paid by the Scioux in the St. Peter's River or the Mississippi. Not quite one half of their credits. Did the Scioux pay so badly before, as since Mr. Ainse was in that Country. He was only one Year in the Scioux Country before, when they paid much better. Mr. Ainse. If he knows if the Couillon Rouge was along with him in the Chipeway Country making peace. Yes, him and some more. Was the Couillon rouge at the great Council held at the River St Peters. He cannot recollect. (signed)

Ainse appeared inside with the Indians, when he came near enough to hear he cried "do you stop" and he said no I pass straight on, ah well said he good evening. The next day he sent Gignere his Interpreter to go among the men de la feuille, to a village where he had put a clerk to learn the result of a Council which Mr. Ainse had held there; having passed a village where the depouant with four or five lodges of Sioux were over night and without whom he could know nothing about it, Gignere his Interpreter returned in the evening saying that, he had found out nothing seeing that all the Indians were drunk. That in the course of the winter he had spoken to one Jerry Stibbins one of Mr. Ainse's engag6s and that he said that he found Mr. Ainse's conduct extraordinary in having passed immediately before his house without giving notice that he went to hold a council with the men of the feuille neither giving notice to his clerk for that winter to be there. That Jerry answered that Mr. Ainse had his reasons for not telling his clerk to be at the Council, merely having said to the Indians, there is my son speaking of Mr. Chevalier, he is your trader who has been given you by your father, I, who also know your father recommend him, as well as the Fete Jaune, speaking of Sieur Dickeson, these are the only traders which your father has given you and to whom you should pay attention, if you have a skin, I recommend you to throw it down at the door of his house, as for the bad hand, speaking of Mr. Campion's clerk named Ambroise, do not pay any attention to him, leave it there.

Little Soldier, dressed like a chief, with!a lance in his hand came to him and said here are all our soldiers who are arriving, our father sent us to make you descend the current as well as to say that if you do not descend he told us to take a barrel of brandy and that you must give 'us credit now. After that four others came, armed with Knives and muskets and singing the death song as his Interpreter told him and they said to him you bad trader, our father Aiuse has told us that you came here to render us pitiable, and to rob us, return then and redescend the current or else that you must give us credit for any thing which we need, it is our father who has told us to take the brandy and to send you back. He answered them, you can say to your father, if it is he that has sent you here, that he must come himself and when he shall come I will give you two instead of one. I am come here to do a good business, if you wish to do evil you have to make haste because I also can do evil; then they left, and there were two in his baggage and they each put a hand on a barrel to carry it away that it was among his baggage along with his men and that he repulsed and ill treated tnese Indians. The Indians then began to fire with loaded muskets into his fire and between his legs and into his tent saying that presently the soldiers would come and you are dead, we will take you and all your goods, that he said to them, that is well, when you have taken these I will go and look for others. I do not want them, neither your other soldiers nor your father Ainse are capable of preventing me from going to winter where I wish. One of his two native servants said to the deponent, if you wish I will kill one of the least, then they will leave you quiet and we will go to the Prairie du Chien, he told them to keep quiet that it was not a question of killing because that would cause trouble. His Interpreter then said to him that he would go and give them two or three bottles of brandy, to which he consented and the Indians went away and he was left quiet. That two days after he overtook Mr. Ainse he reproached him with his conduct towards him and all that the Indians had said to him. Mr. Ainse denied it all and said that he ought to know him and that far from this he had recommended the Indians to let him alone and not to

That in the course of the winter he had the affair made known to the Indians exactly as it happened that they had said to him. "My comrade do not be vexed with us, it is our father Ainse who made us do it, if you would know better ask Rocque, it is he who has spoken to us this long time for him." Mr. Campion then presented and handed to the Court two Certificates touching this affair, one from Hipolitte Larrive dated the 10th of June 1788, and one from Mr. J. Bte. Lamarche of the same date, which have been paraphed and added to the papers of the present Inquest. Q.

If he thought that the general trade and peace, in the Mlississippi, had profited by Mr. Ainse's presence? A. That the conduct of Mr. Ainse this year in his wintering had done great harm to trade and that the Indians were less contented, and more jealous of one another, that Mr. Ainse has done harm to trade by his delay in amusing himself so long on the road, and waiting for him they have lost the greater part of the time for their chase.

Lieut Houghtons DepositionOn the thirty first day of May last he held a board of Survey in Company with the officers of the Garrison by order of Captain Scott on all the Indian Stores that should be shown us by the Deputy Agent in a store in the Village called Mr Ainse's Store, I found a quantity of Corn, the Deputy Agent told me that all the Corn belonging to Government was hull'd, that all the loose unhull'd corn belonged to him, as well as that corn in bags marked S. B, those were canvas bags and held about two bushels or two bushels and a half each, the bags he pointed out as belonging to himself were fourteen in number or there about and were tied up. I took the liberty however of opening one of the bags he claimed as his own, and found in it hull'd corn, and observed to him that from his own acknowledgement it must belong to Government, he said he supposed it was put-into that bag by mistake by Mr Reed his clerk. I took the liberty however of opening all the bags S. B. and found them all contained hull'd corn. of course I took them into my report as belonging to Government. During the Winter I was informed by the Commanding officer that the Deputy Agent had applied to him for Corn for the Indians out of the King's Store, out of that Corn that was given as a present by the Ottawas last fall, as the Deputy Agent declared he had none left. On producing the Report of my board to the Commanding officer, he observed the inconsistency of the Deputy Agent having applied to him for Corn during the Winter, and now finding a quantity in my report on the seventh day of June in Public Council the Deputy Agent presented a list of articles then given to a band of Indians, in which list was twenty four gallons of Rum, he was asked by the Commanding officer if the Rum was actually pure Rum, or mixed with water, when he declined answering directly to the question and refused to produce a sample. I then broached a Keg & found it mixed with water which upon trial to the best of my knowledge, I do believe to have been three gallons of water to five gallons of Ram, we did not sign

his list of Articles. Mr Dease took the list with him & we have never signed for that present. W. HOUGHTON, Lieut 63d Regt.

Question by the Court to Mr. AinseFor what sum he had given the furs to Mr. Todd last Autumn? A. That he had sold them for about five hundred and eleven pounds, Halifax, and that this was all that he had procured in his voyage to the Upper Country. Q. How had he had these furs? A. That a part of these furs were the produce of the chase of seven Indians whom he had brought with him with Capt'n Byrne's permission; an other part were the presents which he had received from the Indians in different Villages, and the other part for the trade which he had made by Messrs. Cardin & Chevalier who were with him. That he had appropriated these furs to replace 17 barrels of Rum, two hundred & twenty thousand weight of porcelaine, a bundle of traps, that he had bought from the General Society, and different Goods which he had from Mr. Henry, amounting to forty hundred pounds, Halifax, & two bales of Merchandize, which he had brought from Montreal on his own account, that not having any of these articles in the King's Store & not sufficient rum, the deponant addent that these "Goods were indispensably necessary for his voyage, & that he had been obliged to draw on Mr. Todd & McGill for about two hundred pounds, Halifax, exceeding the amount of furs, to pay the expenses of his voyage. That after his arrival here last year, he had shown Captain Byrne all the skins which he had procured in his voyage, saying that they were not sufficient to pay for the Goods, which he, Byrne, well knew that he had brought with him. That Captain

Byrne had answered him that he had no business with the Department, that it was to Capt. Dease, who had come to succeed him, that he should address himself. That he brought Capt. Byrne to Capt. Dease's house & that in his presence he said to Captain Byrne "Have you given me, last year, to take with me, any thing else but thirteen small bales, nine barrels of rum, four barrels of powder, eight sacks of shot & ball with four or bundles of tobacco and some small trifles," this was said before Mr. Dease who answered "very true."

Mr. Ainse answered again, noBy whose order had he made these Equipments of King's Goods to M...." eRocque, Cardinal, Honore & Antaya in 1787? By the authority that Mr. Dease had given him by word of mouth, saying, Mr. Ainse you know the ways of the Indians, you have been a long time in the Service, and because of all the good reports I have heard of you, I find proper to give you the charge of the goods which you need for your voyage, but manage so as to make the expenses as small as possible, as there is much Merchandize arriving, it is necessary to take the same Goods to the Department to find means to pay the expenses which you will incur in your voyage & to have enough to give the presents to the Indians. That he answered Mr. Dease that this would not be difficult but that he must promise to engage a clerk for him. Mr. Dease said that if this was necessary he could engage one, that in consequence he engaged Mr. O'Neille, believing that he could not find a better means, to pay the expenses which he would incur on his voyage with these same King's goods & to avoid being obliged to draw on Government, than by making these before-mentioned Equipments.

That since his departure he had heard that Mr. Cardinal had sold his furs to Mr. Campion and that Mr. Honore had done likewise, that he had the returns of Rocque, and that Antaya could pay this Summer, that as regards what is due by Larriv6 & Rainville for the Goods which they have taken themselves, for those which he had given them he had received by Mr. Dickson, one hundred pounds of Beaver Skins & twelve otters and some mink for Larriv6 and that Rainville had given him twelve otter skins, twenty-eight martins, nine mink & three deer skins that these furs were here in the King's Store with those of Roque.

Yes, and that he had sent an exact statement of them as well as of all those which he had taken with him & all the Equipments which he had made to the others. Q. If Mr. Dease had approved of those which he had made when She produced the list to him? A. That Mr. Dease had taken the list in his hands, that he was then busy & that he said that he would examnine it. Q. How many days he remained in this post after having sent this list to Mr. Dease? /A.

That he did not understand well what they said but he called Mr. La Marche and asked him what the Indians said of Campion, that he said that they were the same words that they had said before. As soon as he got up he sent to look for Mr. Roque and said to him "There are the Indians who annoyed Campion, what have they to say." Roque spoke to them, and they said that they were not satisfied because Mr. Campion had neglected giving them a present and had taken goods to the more distant Villages who had not listened as well as them to the words of their father. Then he said to Rocque, "Say to them that they must listen to me, I am not come here to see barrels of rum pillaged nor to make any one want, but that they must go and speak to him as one would speak to a friend & ask him if he will give them credit and if he will not give it to you, tell him to turn back but do not insult him, and if he will not come tell me.

The Court adjourned till to-morrow morning at eight o'clock. The 8th of July at 8 o'clock in the morning the Court continued the inquest in which Mr. Dease had produced his defense in the present inquest as follows: [Q 48 part I page 174] Mr. Dease's Answer. Mr. Dease's answer to the charges that respect himself contained in the Memorials signed by some Merchants & Traders of Michilimakinac presented to His Excellency the Commander in Chief, and Captain Scott commanding at Michilimakinac &c. in the year 1787. It is with a grateful sense of His Excellency's Justice in ordinary a court of Inquiry on the subject of the above mentioned Memorials, presented to him and containing complaints of an improper interference of that branch of thelIndian Department under my direction at this post, that I take this opportunity of answering such charges as have been produced against me, an Opportunity I sincerely wished for & had last summer warmly solicited for, tho' the reasons then given by the Merchants for not submitting to a Court of Inquiry, still exist as last year, that the [Memorial given in to Capt. Scott last year was partial will appear from the circumstance that several Merchants belonging to the General Society were solicited to sign it, and refused, that these were not the least respectable part of that Society I believe will be pretty evident, their names being known. The following are the principal charges respecting me, those that regard Mr. Ainse he has already answeredFirst Charge, that peace being concluded among the Indians, it was no longer necessary that Mr. Ainse should return with presents among them, as he would trade them in prejudice to their commerce.

2nd Charge-That Clerks and Engag6s employed by the Indian Department were paid out of the presents sent up here for the Indians3rd Charge-That they feared their commerce would suffer considerably this year, 1787, as there was a greater present to be sent out than the preceeding one4th Charge-That the Indians being induced by flattering promises to come to this post, had returned discontented on account of the distribution of presents not being made according to the intentions of Government5th Charge-That the Indian Department opposes all advantages that might derive from their Commerce by preventing them to speak to the Indians in public6th Charge-By lending the King's Goods to be traded under value, a circumstance they could not conform to, and tha their representation on that head was not attended toMr. Dease in answer to the first charge requests the instructions he received in 1786 from Sir John Johnson Superintendent General of Indian Affairs may be read, of which the following is an extractMONTREAL, 1st October 1786. SIR, From the great resort of Indians, even from the most distant nations at the post of Michilimakinac from the extensive Trade carried on from thence and from its consequent importance, but particularly from the great expense that has hitherto attended the conducting of the business of the Indian Department at that post, I have thought necessary for the good of His Majesty's Service that you should repair to that Station and I do hereby require that you do without loss of time, and in the most expeditious manner return to Niagara with the Indian Goods destined for the several posts, and from thence you are to proceed in the first vessel next Spring, the Season being now too far advanced, to Michilimakinac to take upon you the management of the Indian Affairs in that District, for your guidance in which Captain Byrne present Commissary of Indian Affairs, whose appointment must cease on the 24th June, 1787, will deliver over to you all such orders as he received and found necessary for that purpose. In consequence of 73

an unfortunate war raging among some of the Western Nations, and at the request of the Merchants trading to that Country I have taken some steps to endeavor to reconcile them to each other, by sending out a Messenger among them to desire that they would desist from all Acts of hostilities and assemble some of the Chiefs of each Nation next June at Michilimakinac when I shall endeavor to; meet them and to establish a lasting peace, to facilitate which I intend to take with me, or to order round by Detroit some of the Chiefs of the Six Nations, but should I from some unforseen accident or business be prevented from putting my intentions into execution you will take such steps as you will find necessary to accomplish this desirable business. Question from the Board to Mr. DeaseDid he receive any Instructions or public papers relative to the Indian Department from Captain Byrne. A. No, he had often applied to him, except a list of a few presents then remaining in the Indian Store. Continuation of Mr. Dease's defenseMr. Dease was directed to pursue such measures as to him should seem necessary to accomplish the business Mr. Ainse was sent upon, in consequence of the Merchants Memorial to Sir John Johnson and their favorable representation of Mr. Ainse, that in all their Councils and conferences both public and private, after the conclusion of the peace here, the Indians earnestly solicited Mr. Ainse to return amongst them once more, even saying that what had hitherto been done would prove ineffectual, unless he returned among them to confirm them in their present good dispositions, this is a circumstance well known by the commanding officer and all those who attended the different Councils. MT. Dease agreed to their request with the more reluctance as Mr. Ainse had applied for leave to go to Canada the ensuing fall to see his family, from Mr. Ainse's character and the report of his good circumstances I had no reason to suspect any improper use would be made of the presents he should take with him, I beg to refer to the Instructions given to him on setting out of which the following is a copy. MICHILIMACKINAC 19th Augt. 1787 SIm, Having received Instructions from Sir John Johnson

Bart. Superintendant General and Inspector General of Indian Affairs to pursue such measures as would appear to me the most condusive to the accomplishment of the business on which he sent you into the Indian Country last year, and the different Indian Nations lately at war having earnestly and repeatedly solicited your return among them once more to confirm them in their present amicable dispositions towards each other, I think it necessary for the good of His Majesty's Service, and that you immediately prepare to return among these Indians and use your best endeavors to establish a lasting peace among them. You will on every occasion inspire them with sentiments of attachment and respect for the British Government, and in your distribution of the presents you take along you will represent to them the great power and goodness of the Great King their Father and the expense he incurs on their account, by appointing his Servants to watch over their welfare and promote their happiness by uniting them to each other. You will warmly recommend to them the interests of Trade and the protection of those who on that account, and to supply their wants at the hazard of their lives and risque of their property go and winter amongYou will show that"a fair and open trade will always be the firmest source of happiness that in proportion as they promote Trade and observe the advice of their Father, they will be the objects of their Father's attention. In giving presents you will particularly distinguish such Nations or Bands whose Commerce is most valuable to the Traders explaining to them distinctly that the presents they receive are not by way of Trade but merely from the King's bounty. You will keep a regular Journal of your proceedings in which you will record whatever relates to the King's Service. You will report to me any abuses in Trade that may come to your knowledge, or any obstruction you may meet with in the discharge of your duty, and from whom, you will in all your proceedings observe the strictest economy consistent with the business you are sent, and on every occasion make the good of His Majesty's Service principal object of your attention wishing you every possible success in your undertaking. I am Sir &c &c &c.

Continuation of Mr. Dease's Defense. 2ndly. By an official Letter from the Acting Secretary Mr. Langan dated the 5th March 1787 of which the following is an extract: "And as no contingent account will be received from the post you are going to in the Spring, it being thought here that a small Vpart of the presents received by the person residing there and which by a general order is directed to be applied to His Majesty's Servicet are sufficient to defray those expences which untill lately were introduced as charges in the Indian Account." This to me was a positive order to which I thought it my duty to comply and was calculated to save expences to Government at the post where there is no Currency, and everything exhorbitantly dear, a pair of Leggings or a yard of Callico will readily pay, what would cost Government three times their value, by being paid by a Bon or Money. 3rdly Is merely founded on apprehension, I judged it necessary to send out a larger present than was sent out the last, as Mr. Ainse proposed penetrating much further in the Indian Country, than he had hitherto done, in order to extend our Commerce, he consequently should have to pass through many more Nations and thereby be under the necessity of giving more presents than the year before, yet with all the increase of presents the quantity taken in the two years into the Indian Country does not amount as I am informed to much more than a third of what the Merchants best acquainted with the Country Trade recommended to Sir John Johnson to send by Mr. Ainse the first Winter. Last year some disturbances that happened in the Scioux Country joined to a severe indisposition, which prevented his carrying into execution, what he proposed at setting out from this post, induced Mr. Ainse, in compliance with his instructions to have some presents traded for the Interests of Government, rather than unnecessarily give them away without any prospect of promoting the King's ServiceMr. Dease questioned by the Board. Q. Were not the Equipments of the King's Goods of Mfr. Rocque, Honor6 & Cardin made at this post prior to Mr. Ainse's going out

A. So it appears by Ainse's Evidence. Copy of a Letter wrote by Captain Scott to Mr. Dease dated 17th September 1787 and produced to the Board. Sir, Having reason to believe the last vessel for this post will arrive in the course of a few days I therefore beg you will send as soon as possible the Lists of the presents given in public Council to the different Indians in order that they may be signed & certified. You will likewise be so good as to send me an exact List of what Goods you have sent out by Ainse. I am &c &c. Mr. Dease questioned by the Board. Q. Did he receive that Letter. A. He supposes so. Q. What was his reason for not complying with the above request and having sent only a List of part of the Goods sent along with Mr. Ainse without makinrg mention of the Equipments that appear to have been made. A. At this distance of time, it is probable that my reasons for so doing may not occur to me, but believe the following are the principal ones. First- He. found nothing in his instructions that induced him to think himself accountable to Capt. Scott for his management of the Indian Department, in which it was Lord Dorchester's orders that he should not interfere. Secondly- Capt. Scott and himself differed in opinion concerning Mr. Ainse's returning to the Indian Country, therefore it was a matter he took upon himself, and thought himself very justifiable from his instructions. Q. Whether Capt. Scott did not disapprove of Mr. Ainse's going out, or any Goods sent into the Indian Country. A. That to the best of his recollection he did. Continuation of Mr. Deases Defence4th. That the Indians went away well satisfied and very thankful for the presents they received is proved by all the minutes of the Councils they held, by their conduct since, by their repeated intreaties to have Mr. Ainse sent back amongst them once more, and he believes by the recollection of several Gentlemen here present who assisted at the Councils of last year, There could not be a more decisive proof

of their attachment then the Chipeways and Ottawas gave lately in fitting out immediately two parties to bring in the Murderers of the two Negroes a task as they declared more painful to them than to go to War against the Osages or the Mexicans but they were determined to obey the will of their Father. 5th. Mr. Dease certainly refused to deliver to the Scioux a speech written by Mr. Charles Paterson, by which Mr. Dease was directed to give his approbation to Mr. Paterson's proceedings in St. Peter's River in winter 1786-1787. Long before Mr. Dease took the direction of the Indian Department at the post of Michilimakinac & Mr. Dease did not certainly consider it a part of his duty to call Councils & deliver Speeches directed by any Trader in this post. Mr. Dease never in the smallest degree interfered in the usual Commercial intercourse of the Indians and Traders of this post, they did not require his permission to speak to them on every subject that related to their Trade. Mr. Dease understood it to be Lord Dorchester's orders that the Traders should confine themselves to what mearly concerned their Trade without further interferance. 6th. Captain La Motte accompanied by a Mr. Pollard, Merchant, had in the Month of July last applied to me for the loan of a few Goods out of the Indian Store, which he would shortly replace, as he expected daily a boat with Goods from Detroit, that wanting them at that particular time was extremely injurious to him and that lending them out of the Indian Store could be of no prejudice to the Service, as they should be long returned before wanted. He also mentioned his having been pillaged and taken prisoner by the Indians, by which he suffered much in his health the preceeding autumn. As I knew him then to be a half pay Captain in the Detroit Department and a person who had long been employed in the King's Service and suffered much when taken prisoner with Lieut Governor Hamilton on his Expedition from Detroit to the Illinois Country and persuaded that the Service here could not in the least suffer by it as I had reasons to believe his goods were on the way to this post and moreover having then no instructions to the contrary, I did not think myself in the least culpable

583

in directing the Storekeeper to let him have the small quantity he demanded for which he gave his receipt and promised to restore them, and with both which he soon after complied as has appeared by Mr. Dixons evidence. After his receiving these things he might dispose of them at what price he thought proper, or even bestow them, for which he would not in the least think himself responsible. I can with confidence affirm that there has neither been a public or private transaction of mine with the Indians since my arrival at this post in June 1787 that did not rather tend to promote than injure its Commerce. Soon after my arrival here I called the Merchants together, and as people well acquainted with the nature of the Commerce of the post requested they would instruct me how I could best serve them in my capacity. In all the Councils both public and private held with Indians, in the articles of peace concluded between them, in my instructions to Mr. Ainse on his going into the Indian Country, after recommending their attachment to the King's service, my next object was to consult the interest of Commerce, by insisting on the most friendly attention to the Traders, and a due punctuality in paying their debts dealing honestly with them as the surest means of recommending them to their fathers notice and kindness. These facts can be easily substantiated by many people here and by my Journal for that period and by the minutes of the different Councils. In the year 1787 in pursuance of my instructions from the Suprintendant General I arrived here in the middle of June and had the mortification, the greatest difficulty in procuring quarters either for myself or the people employed in the department, for them I was obliged to pitch my tent, and had recourse to the kindness of the Inhabitants for myself and obliged to remove from house to house four times, thus situated and a stranger to the post and the Indians frequenting it, who at that time came in from all quarters and were continually very importunate, I thought myself very happy in the assistance of Mr. Ainse the Interpreter a person strongly recommended to me for his influence among the different Indian nations and his abilities in managing them, to him I communicated my instructions at the same time

giving him a discretionary p)wer to manage the interior part of the department to the. best advantage for His Majesty's Service, while I attented public Councils &ca. These circumstances duly considered will evidently account for my want of punctuality in my public accounts. Before the reduction of the Department I had sufficient assistance on these occasions. Here I found myself alone, a stranger & deprived of that assistance. In regard to Mr. Ainse returning to the Indian Country I thought it necessary, for reasons already mentioned Capt" Scott has not approved of which prevented me from being as communicated on taht subject as I should have been. On the 30th ultimo Captain Scott president of this Board received a Letter from Capt. Wm. Houghton of which the following is a true copy (see page -) These are grievous charges to a person of the least sensibility and how very well supported will appear by Mr. Houghton's own evidences and even from what he advanced himself and tho' he very early in July 1787 condescended closely to watch my front and back door, and probably since continued the same practice, what he has been able to collect to my prejudice has been already produced to this Board Vizt.That early in the morning of the 3d of July 1787-To this charge I answer that the back way into my Rouse was as frequently used.as the front one, that it was no crime in me to receive the present from the Indians, which proved to have been three Robes or Blankets and which Mr. Dixon's evidence will prove of being sent to the King's Store, in order to be sent down according to my instructions. The other Witnesses which Mr. Houghton examined, which consisted of my counter-woman, Taylor and others, from whom he could extract nothing for his purpose, evidently proves that his charges against me are founded on mere suspicion-In regard to the survey of corn, a considerable quantity of Indian corn given in present last fall by the Ottawas and other Indians frequenting the post, was lodged in the acting Commissary's Store, according to my instructions-I mentioned to Capt. Scott to have it issued occa

sionally to the Indians, that it might be applied to no other use, and the event proved me right in so doing, having received from that Store sixty six bags less than the original quantity given in, the which was given to the King's Cattle by Capt. Scott's order. The hull'd or Sied Corn he reserved for a more pressing occasion, when the Indians should according to custom arrive here in considerable numbers. Capt. Scott knows that at his desire I mentioned the day for holding the Survey and could I be base enough to think of secreting or applying the corn to my own use, I had full time and could easily have removed it. The fact is that without my knowledge my servant had used some bags in which I bought some Indian Corn from Niagara for my own use. In removing that from Mr. Meldrum's to our Store I can easily prove that Sied Corn was never used in my family nor given to any but Indians-I believe the Interpreter Mr. Gautin might have told Captain Scott that I had not Indian Corn when he applied for that in the Commissary Store, as I am sure he knew nothing of my having procured some from Mr. Meldrum, he being then in Canada, but to the best of my recollection I never mentioned to Captain Scott that I had none. On the 7th of last June after having fitted out a party of twenty-eight Ottawas and Chipeways to bring in some Iudians who murdered and plundered two Negroes last winter-I as customary invited the Chiefs to dine with me, just at dinner time I was informed that there was not a sufficiency of Rum in the house to compleat the present 1 intended to give these Indians in the evening, I accordingly sent to the acting Commissary for a barrel of Rum which, to the best of my recollection was rolled in while we were at dinner-This Rum I neither saw nor tasted till 1 came to the Council House, When Capt Scott asked if it was mixed, I answered that I could not tell, mentioning the circumstance of its having been brought from the Store while I was at dinner with the Chiefs, and my not seeing it till in Council. On this Mr. Houghton went out and brought a tumbler, broached a Keg and declared it was mixed -On this proceeding it is unnecessary to make any comment, there is no person conversant with Indian Affairs that does 74

A. Q. A.

Whether he recollects that the Chipeways on the 3rd of July, 1787 early in the morning brought to his House a present of Furrs and what they were. Yes, probably three or four Blankets. Do you recollect what became of them. Yes, he received directions from Mr. Dease to have them carried to the King's Store, which was done telling him that no presents were to be appropriated to private use, but were entirely for the use of Government, and were to be sent down by the first opportunity. Does he recollect what instructions he received when he went to meet the Chipeways with provisions. Mr. Dease told him to tell Mr. Cadot to take care of the presents intended as presents to Government, that they should not be traded. Does he recollect whether the Indians went in by the front or back door. He recollects it was the front door. (sign'd) ROBT DIOKSON

DEFENSE OF MR. DEASE. QUEBEC May the 1st 1790. Mr. Deases Answer to the Charges given in against him by the Traders of Michilimakinac in the year 1787. I am happy that I am indulged with this opportunity of appearing in my Defence before Gentlemen of your respectable Characters. The mortification that I have experienced from the painful reflection that my conduct as an officer had been arraigned, and my integrity questioned can only be conceived by those who have a just sense of the value of an honorable reputation. Almost nineteen years of my Life spent in his Majesty's Service, and sixteen of them as Deputy Agent in the Indian Department with the fullest approbation of my Superiors and without the least reproach, induced me to hope that a Character thus established would have shielded me from the shafts of malice. It was my lot in the execution of an important Commission intrusted to me by the Superintendant General of Indian Affairs to differ in opinion with part of the Commercial Society formed at Michilimakinac, their minds had been soured by heavy losses sustained in Trade, occasioned by a War among the Indians, and by an injudicious system of commerce and well known mismanagement; their Creditors were importunate and naturally enquired into the reason of their ill success, it became necessary to find excuses to appease them, and the Indian Department was thought a fit object to which their failure might be ascribed-henco arose their complaint and Memorial containing the Charges against me, however it is with pleasure I can say that only a part of that Society signed the Memorial, others, and by far the most respectable rejected it with contempt. The appointment of the Members of the Board of Inquiry, the manner of making the Charges and the mode adopted by the board in the investigation of them must appear to the Honorable Committee to be extremely improper & injurious, and of which I have just right of complaint. By their Memorial and the proceedings of the Board it will appear



Page 588
588

DEFENSE OF MR. DEASE.

that they have joined me with an inferior officer in their accusation and examination, for whose conduct I cannot be responsible. On the good sense and candor of the Hofible Committee I confidently rely to make the necessary discrimination. And to their candor I also submit the unprecedented conduct of the Board of Enquiry in exceeding the limited authority committed to them and extending their examination to matters that happened posterior to their complaint against me which was dated the 10th of August 1787 not two months after my arrival at Michilimakinac. And I might also with justice complain of the president of that Board, not only in the appointment of the Members who composed it, and of his acting in the three capacities of Accuser, Witness, and Judge, but I may also add that with much difficulty I was allowed a few hours only to offer my observations on the evidence that had been received against me during nine or ten days. It will be unnecessary to do more than barely to mention to the Hofibl Committee, one more cause of complaint to shew that in the whole of the proceedings from the commencement of the complaint to the transmission of the papers from the Board of Enquiry to this City, I have been treated with a degree of cruelty & prosecution unknown and unparalleled. Upon the first information I received of the com plaint being made against me to Captain Scott as will appear by the.Memorial of my accusers to His Excellency Lord Dorchester dated the 14th of August, 1787 and by an extract of my Journal annexed marked No. 2. I applied to Captain Scott and requested a Court of Enquiry to which he then consented, but my accusers refused submitting to it, well knowing that I had then several Evidences to produce. Upon this refusal I entreated Captain Scott to take the depositions of those witnesses as they were on the point of going into the Country, but this he refused, alledging that he had doubts whether he had authority to administer an oath. On the enquiry which took place ten months after, they were absent, and if to be had could not be admitted consistent with the rules adopted by that Board who con

At this distance from Michilimackinac, if those Witnesses were now there it would be impossible to produce them before this committee, I am therefore deprived of an Opportunity of fully refuting by incontestible evidence every shadow of criminality imputed to me, and am compelled to submit my conduct to this Honorable Committee on the evidence offered by my various accusers but a reliance on the candor and impartiality of the Hofitb' Committee before whom I now appear, and a consciousness of my own integrity and of having faithfully discharged the duties of my office and trust reposed in me, give me confidence in meeting the charges made against me, however maliciously conceived or unfairly attempted to be supported. To give the Honfb, Committee a just idea of the charges against me, and what led to them, it will be necessary to trouble them with a short narrative of the transactions prior to the time of my being sent up to Michilimackinac. In the year 1785 the commerce of the interior Country had long been in a ruinous condition, and much obstructed by the wars that prevailed with the several Nations of Indians. The traders had in vain attempted to restore peace among them, they found their endeavours fruitless & themselves unequal to the task, and therefore applications were made to the Superintendaut General of Indian Affairs Sir John Johnson, by the body of Merchants trading to Michilimack" inac, complaining that their commerce was ruined by the war and praying his interposition to settle peace among the different tribes, to effect which desirable purpose they recommended that the large quantity of six Canoe loads of Goods were necessary and should be sent into the Country to be distributed among them as presents which consisted of at least six times the quantity that was distributed to them at the Council or that were sent by Mr. Ains of which they complain to have ruined their commerce. See paper annexed marked No. 3, 4, & 5. Sir John took their petition into consideration, and being desirous to gratify them, he sent on their recommendation Mr. Ains in the summer of 86 (who was then high in the

Estimation of the complaining Societ6, and much in the confidence of the Government) into the distant parts of the Indian Country to invite the contending Indians to a Council to be held at Michilimackinac to settle a peace amongst them. And by letter dated the 1st of October 1786 he was pleased to order me from Niagara to repair to Michilimackinac to take charge of the Indian Department there, and he was further pleased in case of his being prevented from attending the great Council to be held at that place for the purpose of settling the peace, to do me the honor to commissionate and authorize me to hold the Council and establish the desired peace amongst the Nations. And he invested me with full discretionary powers to take such steps and to adopt such measures as appeared to me necessary to accomplish that desirable business, as will appear by the said Letter hereunto annexed No. 6. In obedience to these orders and Instructions I repaired in the month of June following to Michilimackinac and in the Month of July I held the Council with the Indians, and with great trouble settled the peace as far as the Deputies sent down by them would admit of, but more was to be done, it was necessary to reconcile the different tribes to whom the Deputies belonged to the Terms that were acceded to by the Deputies at the Councils, and at their pressing importunity and solicitations I pledged myself in Council to send Mr. Ains to them the same summer with presents to confirm what had been done in Council & in pursuanpe of that promise in the month of August on the 23rd day I dispatched Mr. Ains into the Indian Country with presents and a Letter of Instructions for his conduct * Mr. Ains in obedience to my orders repaired to the Indian Country, but even before his departure the Merchants' or Indian Traders instituted their complaint to Capt. Scott dated the 10th of August 1787, on the next day Capt. Scott sent for me and showed me the Traders complaint, upon which I expressed my surprize and requested an immediate Court of Enquiry to which Capt. Scott consented and alleged that it would be necessary to have two civilians of whom I might name one, and the Traders the other, who in conjunction with

some of the officers of the Garrisons should compose the Court. I then requested a copy of the complaint which was refused. The complainants conscious of my being able to prove the falsity of the charges made against me at that time, upon being informed by Capt. Scott of his intentions to institute a Court of Enquiry objected to it and withdrew their complaint and transmitted a copy of it with a Memorial to His Excellency Lord Dorchester, dated the 14th of the said month, a copy of which is annexed. In this situation deprived of the benefit of an Enquiry, I immediately applied to Capt. Scott and requested that he would take the depositions of Witnesses I then had, and offered to produce to him fully to prove the falsity of the charges, but this Capt. Scott then also refused alledging doubts of his competency to administer an Oath, I complained to him of the hardship of my case in being deprived of the benefit of those Witnesses who probably would never be in my power to produce again, which unfortunately has been the case. His Excellency Lord Dorchester upon Receipt of these papers upon the 1st of November 1787 issued an order to Capt. Scott, and directed him as is expressed in the order to form a Board of Enquiry to enquire into the truth of the matters contained in the complaint. This order arrived at Michilimackinac the following Spring when Capt. Scott formed the Board consisting of himself as president, Daniel Robertson, his Lieutenant, Ensign Ottley his Ensign, and William Grant and Alexander Henry two of the General Society of Traders, Louis Carignant Clerk, and A. Holt one of the complainants was employed by the Court to take down the English Evidence. The Court thus established on the 24th of June 1788 proceeded on their Enquiry and examined the Witnesses offered who it will appear were chiefly Clerks and Engag6s belonging to the General Society. A few days before the Court met Mr. Ainse on his return to Michilimackinac was by Capt. Scott's order made a prisoner and brought into Michilimackinac, and he underwent a long examination before Capt. Scott.



Page 592
592

DEFENSE OF MR. DEASE.

Having thus stated the facts that induced the order for the Board of Enquiry, it will be necessary that I should make a few remarks upon the Charges that are contained in the Complaints that concern me. The Hofibl0 Committee have perceived that I had been at Michilimackinac only about 7 weeks when the complaint was instituted against me to Capt. Scott, That I did not go there merely for the ordinary purpose of being Deputy Agent for Indian Affairs at that post, bat that the great purpose of my mission was of the utmost importance not only to His Majesty's Interest, but to that of the Traders and Commerce in the Indian Country. That I was there the Representative of the Superintendant General Sir John Johnson who had invited the Indians by his Messenger to meet him. That I went clothed by my instructions with ample powers from him and with orders in case he should be prevented by accident or unforeseen Business from attending to take all such steps as I should find necessary to accomplish the desirable business. That thereby a general confidence was placed in my Judgement and a trust reposed in my discretion, the great object to be attained, and to me only was given the power of pursuing such measures and taking such steps as I should find necessary to effect it. In this point of view I am to be considered; whether I made an improper use of the discretionary powers vested in me, or in what manner I executed the trust committed to me, belonged to the Superintendent General to determine to him Report was made and I did not experience his disapprobation. But whether my conduct was such in that transaction as to displease the Indian Traders, to merit their censure, to give just cause for their complaints and afford good ground for the criminal charges they have preferred against me is for this Honb"i Committee to enquire into and determine. It is to these charges as far as they relate to me, I am now to answer, and after the Exhibits I have produced, and the Representation I have already made, I flatter myself that the Honb'i Committee will require short answers to remove



Page 593
DEFENSE OF MR. DEASE.

593

from their minds all imputation of guilt and improper conduct in those transactions. The charges contained in the Letters of complaint to Capt. Scott are general. 1st.-The first is that the merchandize destined as presents for the Indians have been traded against their interest, and that the Magazine which ought to be established for the protection of commerce is made a Store for commerce in opposition to their Store. In support of this charge they have offered no kind of proof that can possibly refer to me, and therefore all 'remarks on it by me are unnecessary. 2nd.-The second charge is that as the peace was established among the Indians it was unnecessary to send more Goods into the Indian Country, that although they were to be sent under the specious pretext of presents yet they would be traded to their great prejudice. The complainants by this charge undoubtedly allude to my intention of sending Mr. Ains into the Indian Country with presents to the Indians in August 1787 to confirm the peace among the Nations that had been agreed to by their Deputies at the Council held the preceding month, what reasons they had for their suspicions that they would be improperly disposed of or that they would be traded with to their prejudice I know not, nor is it to me to account for the disposition of them in the Indian Country. But it behoves me to show the necessity and usefulness of the measure, and also my instructions to Mr. Ains on his departure with them for his direction in the distribution of them to the Indians, and for his pursuing the object of his Mission. I have already remarked to the Honble Committee that at the General Council to establish the peace with the Indians at Michilimakinac the Deputies from the different contending nations attended, that Terms of peace were agreed upon as far as their power extended; but that to conclude the busi ness, it was necessary the different Nations should accede to and notify the Terms the Deputies had agreed to. That the Deputies importuned and solicited me until I made

es of them a promise in Council that Mr. Ains should return inrked x. to the Indian Country that Summer for that purpose. The promise was made in the presence of Capt. Scott and of all the Traders who chose to attend the Council who were invited by me to be present at it. I appeared there to represent by special authority the Superin* tendant General. The promise I made was sacred, and with Indians especially binding, they had departed under the conviction that I would perform it, the object of compleating the peace was important, the Trust had been committed to me, and my duty required me to execute it, the trifling injury that one Canoe load of Goods (which was only one sixth part of what they recommended to Sir John Johnson as necessary) sent into the Country as presents would do the Traders urged by them as a reason for my breaking my solemn promise made to the Indians was insufficient to prevail on me to deceive the Indians and thereby render abortive all the measures that had been taken to effect the desired peace. I had a right from the powers given me to judge of the usefulness and necessity of the measure, I exercised that Judgment as I thought most advancive of His Majesty's Interest and that of the commerce in general, and altho' it met with the censure and dissapprobation of a few interested Traders, yet I presume it will meet with your approbation. Mr. Ains was appointed and sent by me to distribute the SGoods and to reconcile the Indians to the desired peace, I found him on my arrival at Michilimakinac high in the confidence of the Superintendent General who had sent him out with presents the preceeding year, and much esteemed by the Traders, he was desirous of returning to his family that Summer, but I detained him and employed him in that 0o. 8. business. The instructions I gave him must speak for themselves, a copy of them are annexed, and how he executed them he will explain to the Honblo Committee. 3rd. The third charge is that the distribution of the Goods sent up for the Indians had not been made agreeable to the intentions of Government, that the Interpreters had received their presents and had traded them to the Indians in such a manner as to occasion discontent amongst them.

There has been no pr6of offered of the truth of this Charge to the Board of Enquiry, neither was there the least foundation for the charge. The presents were distributed to the Indians at the Council in such proportion as was thought necessary and proper and they were perfectly satisfied with what they received and with the promise that Mr. Ains should return into the Country in the course of the Summer, as to the Trade that was carried on with them I know nothing of it, neither did I hear of any discontents among them on that account. If they meant to support this charge by the proof they offered of my paying Dixon and Reid with Goods for services they rendered at that time; it may be proper for me to submit that transaction to the Committee. When I arrived at Michilimakinac with the Goods committed to me I found it necessary in executing the object of trust committed to me to employ those persons as Clerks and Interpreters and assistants-as such they became indispensibly necessary to my purpose. "No funds were established for the payment of these persons. I had received an official Lett(r from Mr. Langan dated the 5th of March 1787 which informed me that no contingent "See extractNo9. sub- account would be allowed but expressed a supposition that joined. a small proportion of the presents would be sufficient for the purpose. The Honble. Committee will view me in this Transaction as executing a Trust of Importance committed to me, and a discretionary power vested in me to adopt such measures as I should find necessary, I found an absolute necessity of having their assistance. No other funds or means were provided, or in my power to make them compensation. No contingent account would be allowed, I had been told by the Secretary to the Department, but that a small proportion of the presents it was supposed would be sufficient for such purposes, and as at that time I had received no orders or instructions to the contrary. I conceived myself justifiable and acting perfectly consistent with my duty in paying those persons in Goods for their services rendered to Government.

I shall only add one more remark on this charge which is that it had ever before been customary in the Department to include charges for services of this nature in the contingent account, and they had been payed by Government. This was a debt contracted for the use of Government in the execution of the business I was sent upon and it belonged to the Government to pay, and to suppose this application of a small proportion of the Goods that were destined for that service was improper in me, or that any possible injury would result to Government from such application of them, a supposition that could only exist in the minds of persons possessed of narrow and contracted principles, and who entertained the malicious prejudices of my accusers. 4th. The fourth charge is that I prevented some of the Traders from speaking publicly in Council to the Indians and thereby injured their commerce. That I did object to their making public speeches to the Indians is a fact I avow and that I acted perfectly consistent with my duty in making that objection I can scarcely conceive will admit of a question with persons who have any knowledge of Indians or Indian Traders, but if I had permitted the several Traders to have made such speeches as their different interests would have necessarily prompted, I should have thought myself highly culpable, and I might with Justice have been charged with neglecting the duty intrusted to me, I was there, responsible for my conduct in the great object committed to me, and to have admitted an interference of the Traders might have been injurious to myself and highly disrespectful to the Superintendent General whom I represented. I had invited them to attend the Council and many of them did attend. Whether I opposed or injured their Interest or the In'terest of the Indian Commerce at large let the Minutes of Council, my instructions to Mr. Ains pronounce & the extracts from my Journal to them I refer. 5th Charge. That goods were lent to be traded at the Posts for a low price, to which they could not conform without a considerable lossThe only person to whom Goods were lent or appeared on the hearing before the Board of Enquiry, was Capt. La Motte,



Page 597
DEFENSE OF MR. DEASE.

597

to whom a very few articles were lent for a few days and then returned by him into the Store, as is fully proved. But that they were lent for the purpose of being traded at a low price as is stated by the complainants or that they were traded at a low price, to the injury of their commerce there is not a shadow of proof. The fact was, and so I stated it to the Board of Enquiry, where it was acknowledged. That, Capt. La Motte had been plundered & taken a prisoner the preceeding autumn by the Indians that his health thereby was much impaired, that I had known him to be long employed in His Majesty's Service and to have been taken a prisoner with Lieut. Governor Hamilton, and then to hav6 suffered a long imprisonment, he was then a halfpay Captain-Under these circumstances he applied to me for the loan of a few articles for a few days, with the most positive assurances that his goods were on the way from Detroit and that he would replace them, I considered his hard case and directed the Store-keeper to let him have the small quantity he wanted, which he gave to him and took his receipt for them, Mr. La Motte was punctual in returning them as appears by Mr. Dixon's Testimony and for this one act a general malevolent charge is made of lending Goods for the purpose of being traded at a low rate to the Injury of the TradersHow justly the Hofiblo Committee will determine with respect to this transaction, the Committee will be pleased to consider the character and distress of the person, to whom the Goods were lent, the confidence from my knowledge of him I could justly place in his promise. That no possible injury could result to Government from the benevolent Act, but an essential service rendered to a meritorious individual were motives with me that induced the measure, more especially as it had been frequently done in the Department, and I had then no instructions to the contraryThe last charge made by the Complainants is that I bartered and exchanged some Goods with Meldrum, Todd and MitchellIn answer to this charge it will be only necessary to recall



Page 598

the Hofln' Committee's Attention to the important Iission I was intrusted with, and to make a" very few observations upon the nature of that Barter and the necessity for it. I was at least a thousand miles from any supplies of Articles indispensibly necessary for the use of the great Council I was to hold with the Indian NationsThose Articles were not to be procured at Michilimakinac in any other mode than by Barter, the King's Service required them, I sought for them and found them in the possession of the above persons, a Barter was proposed and as was fully proved before the Board by the Complainants Witnesses, an equivalent for the King's Goods so bartered was received and deposited in the King's Store and applied to His Majesty's ServiceI shall not trouble the Hofbl" Committee with only one Remark on this charge. I had not at that time any instructions inhibiting the measure. But if I had received the most positive Instructions to the contrary, I should have thought that the character I then appeared in, and the great trust and power I was then vested with, would have justified me in incroaching upon those instructions so far as I conceived His Majesty's Service required and the more especially as I was directed and authorized by the orders of the Superintendant General " to take such steps as I should find necessary to accomplish that desirable business. The only charge that now remains is the very extraordinary one made by Capt. Houghton long after the Board had convened. This charge was fully answered by me in the hasty Defence that I was allowed to delivered in to the Board, to that and the Testimony of Dixon which was given on that subject before the Board I must beg leave to refer the Honib: 0Committee from which it will appear how well Capt. Houghton was founded in charging me with Actions in my Department "highly unbecoming the Character of a Gentleman and the office I held under Government "It would have been supposed that a Gentleman who bore the * Rank of a Captain in the King's Army would not have

DEFENSE OF MR. DEASE. 699 made such heavy charges without more evidence than his bare suspicions to support them, I could wish for the sake of that respect which ought to be paid to a person that bears the Honorable Rank of a Captain in the King's Army that I could impute this hasty and rash step of Capt. Houghton to an honest zeal for His Majesty's Service, but an unfortunate dispute that subsisted at that time between Capt. Houghton and me obliges me to attribute it to a less Honorable motive. b But I shall trouble the Honorable Committee no longer on that charge that must appear to them to have been founded in resentment and to have received no colour of support from the evidence of the zealous institutor of it, or even from the Domestics of my Family who were dragged forth to his aidThus I have briefly, but as I conceive fully answered the several charges that apply to me from the complaints made to Capt. Scott & from the Evidence offered before the Board of Enquiry. And it only remains in justice to myself that I add a few general remarks on the whole of this transaction. The respectability and importance of my accusers who signed the Letter to Capt. Scott. and the memorial to His Excellency Lord Dorchester will best appear by a comparison of their names with those who signed the Memorial & petition to Sir John Johnson which is annexed and I believe not one of their names will be found to be honored with a place in that List, neither on the contrary will one of those Gentlemen who requested the interference of Sir John Johnson, and who were Merchants of Reputation, whose names and characters are well known to the Honble Committee appear to have given their countenance or assent to the Letter of Complaint. To this latter Class of Gentlemen I had the honor of being long well known, it was at their sollicitation and importunity that the Council was held, where I had the honor of representing the Superintendent General, and it was to them if to any Merchants I was in the least accountable for my conductThey had in the paper No 3. 4 & 5 annexed, recommended not only the measures to be pursued to establish the peace,



Page 600

but also had pointed out the quantity of Six Canoe loads of Goods as necessary for the purpose. And that Mr. Ains should be one of the persons to be sent into the Indian Country with the presents. It must charitably be supposed as I believe was the fact that my accusers had not been consulted & were Strangers to' these Transactions, to suppose otherwise would raise a difficulty to account for their conduct with respect to me, and wholly to the depravity of Human nature under the influence of interest. A Resort must be had to explain their motives, I was a stranger to them, I had only been seven weeks at Michilimakinac and the greater part of that time wholly employed in holding the Councils and making the peace with the Indians. These are also annexed No 7. & from which the Hofible Committee will perceive how well I merited the charges of neglecting and opposing the interest of Commerce with them. From this short representation of the Institutors of the Charges the Hofible Committee will form an Estimate of their consequence, and from a View of the evidences names and their occupations who were produced to. support those charges they will see what weight their Testimony ought to bear in the scale of Justice & honor. They will be found to consist of some of themselves, their Clerks & Engag6s. I have already complained of the mode of instituting the Board of Enquiry, and of the unfairness with which from the Origin of the Complaint, the whole was conducted, no further Remarks need be added to convince the Honble Committee that I have thereby been deprived of Rights and priviledges that as an officer of Government and au Englishman I was entitled to. I was criminated by, and before interested and partial persons, and I was denied the priviledge of producing my Evidences to exculpate me. The consequences by cruel experience I have severely felt a foul stain was thrown upon my reputation in August 1787, and no opportunity offered to me to wipe it out untill this day, and even now without a possibility of having the advantage of that testimony which was offered and rejected in 1787.

I shall only submit to your candid consideration whether in all the charges made, or proofs offered against me there appears one instance either of peculation or the most distant prospect of advantage that could result to me from adopting it, and whether it could be probable or even possible that I should hazard a fair reputation sustained eighteen years in His Majesty's Service and betray the trust and confidence placed in me on so great an occasion without some greater incitement-If I have erred it was an error in Judgement, but I have the satisfaction within my own breast to feel that my whole conduct was governed by the rules of honor, and that I discharged my duty with fidelity and a strict regard to His Majesty's Interest and that of the Commerce according to the best of my understanding, 'and that I did not use the discretionary power reposed in me in any other manner than I conceived the important business required and my Judgement told me was necessary.

tions, (and the knowledge) of nine of their languages, besides English and French, he accepted, for zeal, the sole employment of Interpreter, of which he thought he would be able to acquit himself with honor. In this capacity and for a fixed salary, during approbation, his employment & life were at no time certain, he has faithfully interpreted what the Government or the nations wished to make heard. This is of what his essential duty as Interpreter consisted, not having any command nor administration from the Department which is under the inspection & orders of Sir John Johnson, Superintendent, & his deputies at Michilimackinac. It is true that besides his employment as Interpreter he, by the direction of the Agents of the Department, received a certain number of bales of goods, in 1786, under the condition of employing them partly to provide for the considerable expense of transporting the rest, by giving them as presents to the Indians distant more than eight hundred leagues in the lands to the west of Michilimackinac, to conciliate the Indians who were in cruel war among themselves, to engage them to peace and trade and to bring the Chiefs of each village to Michilimackinac to make there a solemn treaty. And after having successfully accomplished this complicated enterprise, and economising the expenses-which however had formerly cost a larger sum for inferior objects, for want of having employed the means to evade or diminish the expenses-it was required by a letter of Mr John Dease, Superintendent of Indian Affairs at Michilimakinac, dated the 19th August 1787 to return into the same distant villages, because peace had been concluded on this condition, so much desired by the nations, and to employ the means which he would find necessary to keep them in peace & due attachmeut to Government. He received for this second Journey another number of bales of goods, to dispose of so as to furnish food & the expenses of the voyage & to make the presents that he would find necessary, according to circumstances, in the Villages where he was sent. M_1 Ainse could only render account of his conduct according to the orders which he could show to have been given him as Interpreter and as a contractor for these voyages & for the employment of these goods simply according to the directions of Mess" Byrne in 1786 & John Dease in 1787, in their capacities as Superintendents at Michilimakinac where they were acting as deputies for the Superintendent General of this Department. He was incompetent to judge of their authority and could not be responsible for their conduct nor their superior orders which they had or had not. Having received no orders as Interpreter which forbade him to make such 'oyages, on the conditions and objects for which they had been made; M'

Ainse has, in good faith, filled these views, the directions, even opinions of the true Agents of the Department in effecting the peace and commerce which the complainants really enjoy, by an example of zeal and economy of the expenses which it would have infallibly incurred if he had not employed the means, which his experience had Justified, in favor of the Department. As the complaints in question do not touch the essential duty of Mr Aiuse in his capacity as Interpreter and that they tend, without naming nor distinguishing the accusers, only to show the abuses in general, past abuses which they qualify, themselves, as inevitable in the nature of things, to conclude, that instead of settling as formerly or such as the urgent case requires, st is more advantageous, say the complainants, that no goods be sent to the Indians by Government; it is evident that they are less suing to punish a crime or an infraction of some previous regulation, than soliciting a new rule for the future, which would exclude the Government from employing any means of economy by sending to a distance its goods for presents to the villages where it would be impossible to treat for peace or national affairs. This is a proposition which easily discloses the speculation of the complainants, and that Mr Ainse can not explain by their zeal for the interest of Government. The complaints are contained in a letter dated Michilimakinac 10th August 1787, signed by Messr" Etienne Campion, Charles Paterson & other merchant traders Of the said post, addressed to Captain Thomas Scott Esqr Commandant of the said place. Mr Ainse proposed to follow the order of it, to answer to the contradictions contained in them, although he may not be named nor particularly accused in order to apply precise means of justification, which he flatters himself Your honors will transmit, with clearness & Justice, to His Excellency Lord Dorchester. The first head of complaint is that the intention of Government has been absolutely frustrated &cMr Ainse can only conceive that this complaint is against him because he has been justified by no order which he would have contravened as Interpreter, and that when the enterprises which he had made under the direction of the Superintendants of Michilimakinac had been accomplished, they openly testified their satisfaction with them. The Complainants acknowledge that in 1785 many traders at Montreal, convinced of the damage which they were caused by the misunderstanding of many Indian nations, addressed a request to Sir John Johnson, Superintendant General of the Department, asking him to send to the country of the militant nations, the goods necessary to conclude a solid and durable

peace. Now it was a question of sending some presents to the nations & making peace. In 1786 Captain Byrne then Commissioner of the Department had, without doubt, some instructions or some orders which intimated to him the intentions of Government. Whether he had them or not, he proposed to Mr. Ainse, not simply to interpret the languages, but to employ all the means possible to transport, to the distance of nearly eight or nine hundred leagues, into the different villages of the nations at war, thirteen bales of King's Goods, forming half a Canoe load, although the memorial of the traders had stated that it was necessary to send not less than six canoe loads to bring about the object in question. But the difficulty was to avoid drawing on the Department for money, to meet the expenses of the voyageurs, food, travelling, transport of present, and taking the Indians from one place to another, as the real intention of Government, as Mr. Ainse was given to understand, was to economiseThe only means were to engage various Traders to take route with Mr. Ainse, carrying with them other goods which they bought from the General Society, the complainants, & which were delivered by Mr. Campion, their director. Mr. Ainse took his goods & sold them to Mess" Cardin, Chevalier, Gignere & others who were leaving for their private trade, and he had the happiness of bringing, under these conditions the thirteen bales of King's Goods, which he distributed entirely, as presents to the different nations in their villages. And a proof of this is that it would have been impossible to go among the nations, to stop parties of as many as three hundred Warriors on their road, & bring them to treat for peace at Michilimackinac, if he had not distributed same presents which frequent & multiplied as they were would soon have absorbed the thirteen bales. The considerable expenses he found avoidable by these means, & sustained by the Kindness of those Traders who willingly ran the dangerous risk of going to trade with the nations at warConsequently it had cost Government nothing in comparison with the extraordinary expenses which would have been incurred by any other means. The letter dated the 16th August 1787 which Mr. Ainse, on his return from his first voyage, wrote to Sir John Johnson Superintendent General & that he sent to Monsr. Dease for him to forward, rendered account of all that he had necessarily done among each nation as well as the means & presents by which it had been brought about. He hoped from that time to have merited the approbation which had been shown to him by the Superiors of the Department.



Page 605
DEFENSE OF MR. AINSft.

Three days afterwards Mr. Ainse received the letter, from Mr. Dease, of the 19th August 1787, which required him to return among the same Nations to keep them to the peace, which they had concluded at Michilimackinac. Considering that this was an approbation of his first voyage, Mr. Ainse received the value of two Canoe loads of King's goods under the condition of managing so that the Department would not have to draw upon Gov' for the expenses of the voyage. He was to use these Goods partly to pay these expenses & the rest to make some presents to the Indians in their Villages. These Canoes were equipped under the eyes of Captain Scott Commandant & of Mr. Dease, & under those same Merchant Traders who actually complained of him. Not having any objection to make, Mr. Ainse accepted the commission of this second voyage, under the express condition that he could employ a clerk, who would keep account of the Goods, of which one part would be destined to trade to meet the expenses of the voyage & the rest to give as presents to the Indians. Mr. O'Neil was chosen & engaged as clerk. Mr. Ainse entrusted a part of the goods, which were charged to their account, to different Traders, at a charge that would furnish him with what he would require & on their return to Michilimakinac enable him to meet the expenses of this second voyage. Far from wishing to harm the trade of the Complainants, in partnership among themselves, Mr. Ainse was of opinion that Mr. Rocque one of the Traders who should have assisted to meet the expenses of it had entered into partnership with Mr. Campion Director of their large Society then in the River St. Peter for the part of the King's Goods destined to supply the means with which it would be necessary to meet the expenses of the voyage on their return to Michilimakinac. Indeed they entered into partnership among themselves to share half their profits in bales of furs. Mr. Rocque rendered the bales, at Michilimakinac on his return, which were openly sent to Mr. Dease Commissioner in favor of the Department who should have the product of them to meet the expenses of the voyage. A few days afterwards Mr. Ainse arrived at Michilimakinac with the presents which the nations had given to him, and which he sent likewise to Mr. Dease. As Mr. Ainse waited the returns due by Cardinal & Honor6, there arrived at Michilimakinac Mr. Campion director of the large Society of Complainants who procured the furs made by the said Cardinal & Honore, & to his great surprise was informed by the engag6s of Mr. Campion that heo had succeeded in preventing them from taking their returns Michilimakinac, in fine



Page 606
606

DEFENSE OF MR. AINSe.

that he had exchanged them for those goods with which Cardinal & Honore had exchanged their route & the fidelity which they owed to their enterprise towards Mr. Ainse, who trusted to their return to meet the expenses of the voyage. Did Mr. Campion, who had been in partnership with Mr. Rocque for a part of the same King's Goods destined to meet the expenses, owe him this trick? Is it not then with the worst grace imaginable that the same Mr. Campion who on the one side pretended to aid in economising the expenses of a laborious enterprise for the general good, and on the other side knew of means for appropriating the principal expenses; nevertheless he placed himself at the head of the Complainants to have some abuses corrected, saying that his commerce & that of the traders suffered through the Gov' sending some goods to the distant Nations. Although Mr. Ainse had thus failed to render the account to Mr. Dease, still his clerk could prove to have held them & it is with unequalled satisfaction that they acknowledged that in spite of unexpected losses he had not cost Government any sum of money for having transported & really given the half of two canoe loads of King's Goods as presentb to the Nations in their Villages after having taken them & defrayed the expenses on their return to Michilimakinac. On this first complaint it is just to conclude that the intentions of Government has not been frustrated, although Mr. Campion had undertaken to frustrate them, since the Department had not been charged anything by Mr. Ainse for the expenses of transport, food & other necessities. The second complaint is that the Goods destined for presents had been traded against the interests of the Complainants. They have acknowledged that it was certainly necessary to send some goods to the nations to bring about peace for the good of commerce in general. These objects have been undoubtedly obtained without a penny spent by Government. The Agents of the Department had not destined the number of bales of the second trip all as presents for the Indians in their villages but only about half & the rest were to meet the expenses in these distant Countries so that the presents made in return by the Indians could remain to the interest of Government. And if a part of these goods have been traded for the food or expenses of the voyage the Complainants have suff ed no real damage, since in bringing about the peace they have gained the free trade which these Goods have procured for them. / The only loss which they can plainly show reduces itself to thd fact that Mr. Ainse preferred the interest of Government to that of the Complainants; he has by his knowledge & talents prevented the Government from having to pay

G07

one penny of the expenses of these voyages, which would have been very considerable, no one had been injured by buying from the Complainants or their General Society at an arbitrary price which they willingly fixed on the Goods which they themselves had taken to the posts nearest the villages, if the Government had not sent them or if it had not sent more as they held by their complaint. Mr. Ainse's crime is then in having co-operated to render the Department independent of the speculations of the Complainants at the risk of making them his accusers & by defying them to do by themselves, what he had done cheaper for the general good & especially for the good of the service to which he is attached. He has wasted his health, undergone a serious illness on the voyage & used a part of his goods to feed the chiefs of the nations which he had brought & taken back; and he would flatter himself that after having saved the expenses, entered the presents, made by the Indians, into the Kings' Store. Sir John Johnson Superintendant General came, in person, into the Council of about six hundred Indians at Michilimackinac, as he had promised him,to conclude the peace, correct the accounts of these voyages & indemnify or recompense his deputies for what they had done for the good & real advantage as he had desired it. # The third complaint tends to insinuate that the Indians were very discontented when they returned to their villages. This allegation is incompatible with that which is stated a few lines below. There they acknowledged that the peace was concluded & that it is useless to send any goods to the Indians & a moment afterwards they suppose that the Indians were discontented. The allegation and the pretended discontent are both dated the same day the 10th of August 1787 at Michilimackinac, at the time when the peace had been concluded & Mr. Ainse left to begin his second voyage as he had been desired in an open Council, held to the knowledge of the Complainants. The treaty of peace in writing destroys the idea of this pretended discontent. In 1785 the nation of the Courtes Oreilles (short ears) sent four messengers from Michilimackinac to Sir John Johnson at Montreal with a belt of wampum received from Lord Dorchester to ask that Mr. Ainse might return among them; this was granted them & he went there in 1786. Hardly had he returned among the Scioux than in 1787 the Courtes Oreilles & the Sauteux made the same request of Mr. Dease by a belt received from General Haldimand. At the same time all the nations of Lake Superior and the Country to the West asked in Council & when treating for peace that Mr Ainse would



Page 608
608

DEFENSE OF MR. AINSE.

return among the Scioux and Sauteux, near the mouth of the Mississippi, to keep the nations, which he had pacified in the heat of their war, to the punctual execution of the peace which he had procured fcr them. In 1788 the Courtes Oreilles & the Sauteux made the same demand, in the presence of all the Officers of the Garrison, by a belt of wampum from General Haldimand. Finally in 1789 having received no answer they gave another belt to Lord Dorchester, asking Captain Dease & Parr in open Council, to write to Lord Dorchester & Sir John Johnson in this respect; this they promised them & they openly declared that it was the last belt they would give as they had waited three years for an answer. Such are the proofs of the discontent of the Nations, which Mr. Ainse offers to call in testimony, if necessary, & if the peace which he has caused to be concluded is not the complete proof desired against this allegation. The fourth complaint is on the deprivation, which the Complainants have suffered of the liberty of talking publickly & in general to the Indians. In the beginning of December 1786 Mr. Paterson was at theRiver St Peter holding a Council with a band of about forty Scicitons, one of which he made a Chief by giving him a coat & a flag & making a man named Fresniere interpret for him. Thereupon the two great Chiefs of the Scicitons & Tinctons conceived a great Jealousy, & stopped on their way to Michilimackinac to strike the Sauteux of which they killed some. Mr. inuse cannot dispense with reproaching Mr. Paterson & of making mention of it in his letter of the 16th August 1787, which contains in brief the Journal of his first voyage, of which he rendered account to Sir John Johnson, Superintendant General. In the Spring of 1787 at Prairie du Chien Mr. Paterson held another Council with the Scioux, in a house, telling them there some things above their comprehension & their policy, raising the Commerce too high to the prejudice of the respect due to the Department. In short, that he was going to have two forts built, of which one was already built oni the River St. Peter to the South West of the Mississippi although its North East bank will be a boundary of Canada. These works are of the greatest importance to Government. Mr. Paterson has never been justified in holding such councils, the ordinary permits granted to Traders forbids them, because it is of consequence that the Indians know these things from the most experienced and prudent officers of Government. The request of the Complainants of the 14th August 1787 to His Excellency Lord Dorchester acknowledges that the inquest was made at- the request of Mr Dease who considered himself interested in the complaints, but



Page 609
DEFENSE OF MR. AINSt.

609

that the Cdmplainants had however consented to submit themselves to the opinion of the persons chosen to make it. This confession proves that Mr. Dease made no mystery of his having, in power of a letter from Sir John Johnson of the 1st Oct. 1786, sent some presents to the distant nations & using such measures as he found necessary to bring about peace, he had made arrangements with Mr. Ainse to disribute a part of the King's Goods to different traders to pay the expenses of the voyage. And as Mr. Ainse did it openly & to the knowledge of the Commandants in 1786 & 1786 as well as of the complainants under the direction of Messrs. Byrne & Dease, Deputies of the Superintendant General, all the evidence contained in the proceedings commenced at Michilimakinac the 24th June 1788, after the voyages were made and the peace obtained, are indifferent to Mr. Ainse's cause, because he has never denied having distributed the goods & having employed them to meet the expenses of the voyage for the discharge of Government. He himself traded no goods with the Indians, but went to their villages, told them the paroles of Government & made them.such presents as he could from the small amount of Goods which had been eent to manage these things withIn short Mr. Dease had power from Sir John Johnson by his letter of the 1st October, 1786, to do for the best, the words, so far as Mr. Ainse can recall them were in English" You will take such steps as you may find necessary." Mr. Dease had given the contract to Mr. Ainse with strong powers; he had given all his accounts to Mr. Dease, in person, who could not help approving very much of the disinterested conduct of Mr. Ainse & that alone is a certain means for his Justification. If nevertheless the Government find it necessary to enter into an examination of the particulars of the contract Mr. Ainse would in this case be disposed to make a large number of persons heard as witnesses, whose experience in like voyages would add very very much to the merit which he has made towards GovernmentBy these deeds and the good report which Your Honors have made to His Excellency Lord Dorchester, Mr. Ainse flatters himself he has discharged & promptly rendered the service which called him to Michilimakinac-- Quebec lst May 1790 (signed) AiNNSE [Q48 p II.page 403] 77

during nine or ten days, whereas it appears upon the face of the MVinutes page 90 at the close of the proceedings of the 3d of July, that the Court at Messrs Dease & Ainse's request / notified them that they would be ready to hear what they had to offer, on the Saturday following, and it was not till the 8th of the same month, 5 days after, that Mr. Dease's defence in writing was presented. The Complaint of the "Courts refusal to hear exculpatory evidence, also seems contradicted, for it appears by the minutes, not only that Messrs Dease & Ainse were present during the Enquiry but Cross Examined the Witnesses, and at a sitting on the 7th of July several Witnesses were adduced by Mr. Ainse and examined, and one in like manner by Mr. Dease upon the 8th of July to substantiate a part of his defence; the conclusion therefore is totally against this assertion, because if three or four Witnesses were examined, as many more might have been as they chose; nothing appehrs to show either a request to hear Witnesses farther, or any offer of the kind, nor is there a word in Mr. Dease's written Defence inserted in the minutes, that indicates the absence of any necessary witness or the wish or desire to bring forward proof, on the coAtrary the very nature of the defence sett up-both now and formerly for these Gentlemen, excludes the idea altogether of any foundation for such heavy charges against the board of Inquiry. The Complainants and the Witnesses are next arraigned and their respectability questioned (b) but it is to be observed of Mr. Deases De- the former, that they are at the head of the General Society at Michilimakinac and carry on the business there, and therefore being best acquainted, with the nature of the abuses complained of were the fittest to bring forward and support an Investigation of this kind. The Gentlemen concerned in Trade residing at Montreal and subscribing the petition to Sir John Johnson to procure a peace among the Indians, are no doubt extremely respectable, but nothing proves the necessity or possibility of their subscribing to a Letter wrote and delivered on the 10th of August 1787 to Capt. Scott at Michilimakinac, or the petition to His Excellency Lord Dorchester of the 14th of the same month, nor has anything appeared to shew that the Complaints made

The witnesses appear to be, as well as the persons employed by Messrs Dease & Ainse in the Indian Department as Interpreters, Clerks and Servants, as those of the General Society, and in fact they seem both the proper witnesses upon such a business from the share many of them had in it, and their acquaintance with and residence in the Country, where the scene of action lays; nothing appears to impeach their credibility and as far as we can judge, in general they do not appear to have had any disinclination towards these Gentlemen nor to have gone beyond what they themselves have avowed. The first charge in the Complaint is a general one, that the Goods destined for presents to Indians have been traded with, and that the King's Store established for the protection of Trade has become a trading store in opposition to the Complainants. They state that they suffered loss by the trade carried on with the Goods sent the preceding year i ito the Indian Country, tho' in a much smaller quantity than that projected for that year and that the Interpreters Clerks & Servants already engaged & paid in (c) Vide letter to Kings Goods for the purpose of trading in the Indian CounCapt Scott 10th August 1787 try, made them view it as a trade already established.

Upwards of fifty (50) bales of the King's Goods are carried into the Indian Country in these equipments and with Mr. Ainse himself & others employed by him, & Clerks, Interpreters and Servants are hired, & their Wages paid to them chiefly in King's Goods; the goods in these Equipments are sold at a fixed price and notes of hand payable to Mr Ainse taken for them, one excepted for 7 or 8000 livres to Mr Dixon the clerk of Mr. Dease, by M' (g) Vide Evidence SONeille Dixon Ainee's order, while the maker owed not a shilling to M' Rocque Rainville Wme ins's. exam- Dixon (g) Mr Ainse appears also to have kept a regular store ination Mr Deases Do for himself and to have commissioned or bought goods and equipped or fitted out traders for the Indian Country, at this store the King's fusils were sold.

Such conduct must have and did produce bad effects, Mr. Campion's sination insulted and threatened with death by intoxicated Indians, intoxicated by liquor given them by Mr. Ainse & full of his authority to have goods on credit or to send him, Campion, down the River, must have been very disagreeable & alarming they fired into his tent in his fire & even be

But it appears from Mr. 0 Neils testimony that he boasted of his intention to settle (arrange) the General Society that year 1787, no wonder then they had cause to be afraid as stated in their letter of Complaint. The second charge in the complaint announces a fatal experience which convinced the Complainants that the distribution of the Indian presents had not been made agreeable to intentions of Government and therefore became a subject of discontent among the Indians. The Interpreters received their presents in their Country, engaged them to come to Michilimakinac by flattering promises and after a long and painful Journey they saw their (c) Vide Letter to hopes frustrated and were treated in such a manner that Capt. Scott 10th Angst. 1787. they returned very dissatisfied. (k) On this head we have to remark that a system of trade and giving presents in a due distribution seems inconsistent. When a latitude to trade is given or usurped by the Servants of Government with the goods intended for presents, it will follow that the trade will increase and the presents decrease and as it appears that so great a proportion of the goods sent to the Indian Country both in 86 and in 1787 have been traded, it follows that the Indians giving & expecting presents, especially after a long journey and upon an important occasion, may have been disappointed.

ment, their dissatisfaction. Mr. Ainse received presents in the Indian Country in 1786, what he gave does not seem clearly accounted for, nor does it appear what presents he gave or received in 1787 in the Indian Country, the extent of those delivered at Michilimakinac at the Great Council in July of that year ought to have been in a due proportion to the presents received from them the preceeding year, if not then fully requited, to the distance of their Journey and the importance of the business they came upon, but the transactions in the Indian Country in 1786 might not be fully known to Mr. Dease nor to the Commandant of the post. The third charge complains of the Traders being deprived of the privilege accustomed to be allowed to them of speaking in Council to the Indians on the subject of their trade, and that Goods were lent to be traded at a low price out of the King's stores, which they could not conform themselves to without considerable loss (n) In some of the Councils held by Mr. Ainse in the Indian Country it appears in proof that the Traders of the Society were not called, and indeed the recommendations there given by Mr. Ainse to trade with his friends seems to speak the reason. It also appears in proof that Mr. Dease refused to allow them to speak to the Indians at Michilimakinac in Council, but his reason or the propriety of the measure we cannot judge of (o). That Goods were both lent and exchanged is a both proved and avowed-Captain La Motte had a loan, Meldrum, Mitchel, Winter and Todd had exchanges from Mr. Dease out of the King's Store, John Kirby had an 8 gallon keg of Rum & a like of Shrub, which Mr. Dease stated to be his own, and one La Marche had from him 15 f yards of cloth (p), but in his situation, in our idea, it was y incumbent upon him to have proved both the rum, shrub & cloth to have been his property- As to the price of the goods sold or exchanged, we are no judges, nor is there anything in the evidence that can enable us to say, whether they were over or under-rated-We can only observe that Mr. Ainse told one of the Witnesses he would fit him out on better terms than any Merchant would do (q).

To these three charges Mess" Dease and Ainse "have taken separate grounds of defence and the former relies on the candor of the Committee to make the proper discrimination between him and his inferior officer for whose conduct he says he is not responsible. The latter says he acted by authority of the former, fully acquainted him of all he did for the service before his departure in August 1787 and accounted to him upon his return for his gestion and the proceeds with which he was i(r) Vide both de- satisfied, (r) this is not contradicted by Mr. Dease.

Nothing in this letter appears to us to warrant what followed. It is true* there seemed to be some ground for sending Mr. Ainse again into the Indian Country upon a promise to or request made by the Indians at the Council in July 1787 according to the minutes produced byv Mr. Dease. But it is not the sending him there that is so

blamable the' contrary to the opinion of Capt. Scott who was a meftber of that Council where the request or promise was made; but the abuse of the King's Goods made in trade upon that occasion and the payment of a variety of persons in goods out of the King's store, who were employed without authority. The authority of this letter is greatly labor'd but it will not admit of such a latitude of Interpretation; else the whole order and system of the Indian department would be set aside, which never could be the meaning of the Superintendent General. As little will the extract from Mr. Langan's letter cover these strange transactions. The extract is partial and the whole ought to have been produced, Mr. Langan surely does not leave out the concluding words of his sentences as the extract exhibits, but even in that mutilated extract, the presents mentioned to not apply to the goods sent as presents to the Indians (to the Indians) but evidently to those received from them, nor was this letter a sufficient warrant for the deputy-agent supersede the positive orders of the Commander in Chief. But all this is short of the plea, that Mr. Dease had no instructions to the contrary of what he did. He is asked by the Court whether he received from Capt. Scott, the Commandant Lord Dorchester's instructions or orders relative to the 'Indian Department dated 4th of April 1787 a short time after his arrival, to which he answers "'that he could not remember." Capt. Scott is called upon by the Court and swears to his having deliver'd to Mr. Dease a copy of these Instructions within a week after his arrival at the post, which was on the 15th of June; these instructions we have requested a copy of' from the Commander in Chief and herewith produce them to the board. They will be found to correspond in many particulars to those delivered the 27th of March preceeding to the Superintendant General, on which they are founded, and as there is an article in these last vizt. No. 9, in the following words vizt. "You are to give the agents'or deputies such orders or directions as may be necessary for the proper discharges of their Duty and the fulfilling the object of these instructions." It would be an imputation upon the Superintendant general T8

618 OBSERVATIONS BY ATTORNEY AND SOLICITOR GENERAL. to suppos8 that such parts of these instructions as were necessary were not forwarded to &e Deputy-Agent at Michilimackinac the same spring they were received, and as early as those of the Commander in Chief through General Hope to Capt. Scott. A review of these General Instructions, particularly the 8th 11th 12th 13th 17th 19th and 21st articles will show the importance of this negation upon the several points proved in course of the inquiry, and it may te proper in a military point of view to trace it up and see where the blame lays, but it is still of higher importance to know how, when, and to whom these proceedings sales of goods and expenditures in the Indian Department have been accounted for.

It is n'ot the least remarkable trait in this enquiry that tho' Capt.

Dease and the rum offered to the Indians so much reduced with water as to induce the officers to refuse a Certificate for that present, with the circumstance of sixteen gallons of spirits lent to one man and 15 yards of cloth to another no way accounted for, his suspicions were not altogether without some foundation. An imputation is thrown upon the Court of Inquiry for exceeding the period fixed in the Complaints of the Merchants and extending the investigation to objects which happened <z) Mr Dease's subsequent to the 10th of August 1787 (z). To this we have efence 1st May 1T90. to observe that the enquiry was directed to those complaints generally, and particularly to the conduct of Messrs Dease and Ainse since the former came to the post. The order is dated November 1787 and the Court sat in June 1788 the Complainants predicted, fears for the future injury they were likely to sustain by the measures they saw carrying on in August 1787, these were so many strong warnings to Mr. Dease, for he was apprised of them, and ought in consequence to have been the more circumspect. It was not at all out of the sphere of inquiry to take proof of the reality of the complaints so predicted upon a subsequent enquiry, nor ought they to have been omitted on such an occasion to be brought forward for the good of the service and the interests of Trade (1) Mr. Dease's conduct should stand the test of every I )Vide Capt.

The Twentieth Report) Read the Twentieth Report of the Comof the Land Committee mitee in the words following, vizTo His Excellency the Right Honorable Lord Dorchester Governor General of His Majesty's Provinces in North America &c &c &c. The Committee appointed by your Excellency to examine petitions for the Waste Lands of the Crown, now lying on the Council Table, Humbly Report " The Petition of Captain Caldwell late of Lieut. Colonel Butler's Rangers praying for a grant of lands to his Sons William and James, of a certain marsh at Detroit "" The Committee on the information of Major Mathews humbly set forth that the marsh pray'd for, is situated at the entrance to the River of Detroit, on the North side of Lake Erie, it is about two miles in front, by six in depth, and is only fit for Grazing Cattle.-It lies between a small grant made by Indians to some officers of the Indian Department, who served in the War in that Country, and a later grant from the same, of six leagues which Captain Caldwell procured at considerable expence to himself and which he gave up to Government for the purpose of extending the settlement occupied by Disbanded Rangers and meritorious -Loyalists-If it is your Excellencys pleasure to grant the land pray'd for, the Committee conceive that the improvement of the marsh would be of public benefit.-When Major Mathews laid out the Settlement for Rangers & Loyalists the marsh was left out, unfit for Improvement."By order of the Committee (signed) "HUGH FINLAY in the Chair"

"The Memorial and Representation of the Merchants Traders and Inhabitants of Detroit."

are seized with an infinite alarm for the security of their properties, under an arrangement which they see pregnant with the most destructive consequences. Upon a subject therefore with which their interests, are so intimately connected, Your Memorialists take the Liberty of applying to Your Excellency with that freedom of Representation, and confidence of relief, which the justice and benevolence of your character inspires." "The Inhabitants of this corner of His Majesty's Dominions have long felt the hardships and expence of being obliged to resort to Courts distant many hundred miles, for the obtaining payment of just debts, which in many cases become so burdensome, that the trouble, expence, and uncertainty of recovery was nearly equivalent to a denial of Justice. This could not escape Your Lordships penetration, especially when the increasing population of the Country rendered their situation more peculiarly grievous, and therefore to afford relief on that head we attribute the present establishment.-But while we acknowledge and are sincerely grateful, for the goodness and justice of 'your intentions, permit us to say that this system will be infinitely worse to us than the evils it is meant to prevent.-The safety of property and consequent prosperity of Commerce, depends in the first instance on the establishment of Equitable and wholesome Laws; but however good these may be in themselves, they will prove essentially deficient if there are not men of Professional abilities and integrity to dispense them.-" "Jurisprudence is a Science perhaps of all others the most intricate, indeed peculiarly so under the complicated state of the Laws of this Province, and it can be only a regular course of study and application joined to abilities, that a competant knowledge of it can be acquired. It is also indispensibly necessary to the due administration of Justice that no Judge have an apparent or probable interest in the event of his decisions; for under theimperfect state of human nature it cannot be supposed that the most consummate integrity would remain proof against being biassed by a 3ontinuance df the operation of private interest and local attachments.-To the Characters as Fellow Citizens of the Gentlemen appointed as Judges we pay every respect and admit them to be as eligible as any to be found in the District under similar circumstances; but we object to them for other reasons, not less concluisive, and which we are persuaded Your Excellency will see the Justice of. -Two of them are extensively interested in Trade, and discussions respecting property connected with it, must nine times out of. ten affect them either immediately or circuitously. The influence of probable interests and attachments becomes more extensive and dangerous in proportion as the community is confined; hence it is more to be apprehended here than in a large and populous place, and it would not be at all impossible that under the idea of

conciliating the good will of the Judges the Trade of the District should gradually and at last wholly center in the Bench. The Professions of Judge and Merchant combined in the same person are wholly incompatable. To do justice to either particular the first would require his whole time and attention, and if that cannot be bestowed one or perhaps both becomes a sacrifice. A Judge ought to be independent of the favor or frown of any one, which can never be the case whilst his subsistence and Emoluments are derived from another profession, and that depending so materially on the good offices of Individuals. The next objection being the want of professional abilities to the whole Bench. However good their understandings may be, yet it cannot be considered any reflection on them to say, they must be deficient in that knowledge of Law necessary to so important a station; and if wanting in that respect, which they will themselves admit, how can they expound or apply it to the numerous cases that must occur. The instability and uncertainty of decisions have often been complained of; While such therefore was the case where the Judges followed no other profession, and from time to time had acquired knowledge and experience, what may be anticipated from those who have other avocations, that will necessary employ the bulk of their time? We are sorry to observe in the addition to the Commission of the Peace some persons who are entirely illiterate, which must Diminish the respect due to the Laws and consequently prevent the beneficial effects, resulting from a well informed Magistracy. Touching upon persons or characters is ever an inviduous and delicate subject, especially when it falls upon those who are in their proper stations valuable members of the community, but cases may occur where to be silent would be criminal. This we apprehend to be the case in the present instance and beg leave to assure Your Excellency that in 6ur representations we are guided by the strictest truth advancing nothing but what we can substanciate. Much of the Commercial prosperity of the nation is at stake in this District, perhaps as much as in all the others combined, and from the hazardous nature of the trade a proper judicial establishment is essentially requisite to give any security to it.-But that security can alone be obtained by the appointment of at least one person of professional abilities and character with a salary depending neither on perquisites nor the voluntary contributions of Individuals.-Perhaps under the present situation of our Mother Country it may be thought ill timed to require what would add to her burdens; but what we ask is for her safety as much as our own, and which would be eventually repaid to her abundantly through the channel of oar trade when protected by a proper Court within reach.-If however a Professional Character as a Judge cannot be granted at present what temporary expedient can be proposed? To answer

this, is we are fully sensible a most difficult task; but we beg leave to suggest with all due deference and submission, as an approach towards obviating the dangers and inconveniences to be apprehended from permanent Judges connected in Trade or following at the same time other occupations-to form a Court of Arbitration composed of such a number of Justices of the peace with intelligent Merchants and Inhabitants, as being divided into classes, would enable them without inconvenience to their affairs to sit by weekly or monthly rotation, invested with competant, powers to compel the attendance of Evidences, and to carry their Judgements into Execution.-The parties to have the right of objection to any member sitting in their cause upon assigning proper reasons.-There is local experience to enable us to decide here upon the utility of an institution nearly similar; and this idea when modelled, and improved by Your Excellency we think might answer valuable purposes to us.-We presume not to say however, whether this would be proper for that part of the District comprehending the trade of Michilimakinac and Country beyond it, those who are most intimately concerned in that Commerce are better qualified to propose what would be most suitable to their situation. -By granting relief in such way as Your Excellency's wisdom shall seem most adviseable and proper. Your Memorialists shall ever pray.(signed) Wm. McDoNALD.

What may be the yearly amount of British Manufactures sent from Detroit intothe Indian Countries, and how much may the annual consumption of British Goods be within the Settlement? Do the Merchants in Detroit import their goods directly from Britain? Do the Merchants at Detroit send their furs to the London market? How was the Court of Arbitration mentioned in the Memorial from the Detroit Merchants to Lord Dorchester modelled?

of the Court of Common Pleas for.the District of Hesse, under the late Ordinance, did not think it proper to sign the Memorial. There are many Indian Traders Canadians in that Settlement who take Goods on Credit from the importers and carry them into the Indian Country, but they are not considered as Merchants, a few of them were then on the spot; the rest of the inhabitants are not concerned in trade being for the greatest part planters, who consider themselves but very little concerned in Courts of Law. About ~60,000 is sent yearly into the Indian Countries and the annual consumption in the Settlement, amounts to above ~20,000. They send their orders to an Agent at Montreal, who imports them under their niarks and on their account and risk on Commission. They send their Furs and peltries to their Agents at Montreal, who ship them to London to be sold on account of the Detroit Merchants, and their net proceed is placed to the credit of their accounts current by their correspondents at Montreal. A General Arbitration Bond was entered into, and every person who signed it bound himself to abide by the decisions of the arbitrators, (they sat in Rotation). Those who submitted their differences to the arbitrators could not be compelled to abide by their decisions; yet the dread of

What is meant by the uncertainty which attended the resort to the Court at Montreal, as mentioned in the Memorial? What are the names of the illiterate Commissioners of the Peace alluded to in the Memorial?

the consequences of refusing to submit to those determinations gave force to their awards; for those who would not obey could not recover debts, and the commanding officer refused to grant them passes to go for their Canoes to the Indian Country; yet still there were people who refused to abide by their decisions not from unreasonableness nor the injustice of their awards but from a want of inclination to pay their debts. It was agreed by those who signed the general arbitration bond to pay each an equal portion of the expense of any suit of Law which might be carried on against any of them in consequence of their decisons in this Arbitration Court. People who lived in Detroit were compelled to submit or live there as out Law'd. I cannot undertake to say what is meant by the word uncertainty in alluding to the Courts at Montreal, unless it means that the frequent appeals from the Courts of Montreal (as I have heard) give the Merchants in Detroit room to apprehend there would still be more frequent appeals from the Judgment of Men not bred to the Law, and where those of the Bench have other avocations. Tho' Mr. Maisonville and Math. Elliot can mechanically sign their names they can neither read nor write, Capn Caldwell has not had a good Education, There's no other objections to people in the Commission, Cap" La M otte is not a popular character, Mr. Adhemar is settled at St. Vincents in the American States, I imagine the gentleman in the former Commission are fully sufficient to do all the business,

but if more are considered necessary, Mr Askin, Mr. Leith, Mr. Shepherd and Mr. Sharpe are men of liberal education and highly respected in the Settlement, there's likewise Mr. Park and Mr. Abbot but I am sure none of them would act with those mentioned as exceptionable in the new Commission. Tis' computed that 4000 depend on Detroit including the River Raisin about 30 miles below it; where there's about 40 Canadian families settled. People have sat down on Lands on many other rivers pretending right under Indian Grants; and some there are who claim a right from being the first occupants. 0

How many souls do you reckon in the Town and Settlement round Detroit? Questions put to Mr. Robertson a Merchant of Detroit by Mr. Baby. Do you know if the old inhabitants of Detroit have been consulted about the request actually before us? For what reason have they not signed or not joined in this representation? Are you of opinion that this request is in conformity with their desires? Do you not think that it would be more equitable to know more particularly their intentions in so interesting an object before proceeding to an establishment for the administration of justice? 80

Answer, that those of the town and the surroundings have been informed. Answer, that he did not know but that he knew that the most of them could not write. Answer, Yes I think so.Answer, that he can certify nothing in this respect.-'

Do the Merchants not employ a great number of Canadians to go as clerks and engages in the parties sent to trade? Do you not think that it often raises disputes among the Canadians and their citizens? Can you tell us if in general the Merchants of Detroit possess lands in the place?

Answer, Yes.Answer, that it happens from time to time but mostly among the Canadians themselves.Answer, that many have in this case.

Questions addressed to Mr. William Robertson, Merchant of Detroit, by Mr. Grant. Answers thereto.

Question t 1 f How long have you resided at Detroit in the District of Hesse, and what business have you principally followed? Question } 2d. J What laws do you think would promote most effectually the Commercial Interests of the District of Hesse?

Ans. 1 f I have resided constantly at Detroit for upwards of six years past, nearly two of them employed in conducting a Merchantile concern there for another House, and upwards of four years on my own account in the same line.Answer 2d. f As almost all the trade of the District is in the Hands of the English at least Mr. Baby, is the only excep. tion at Detroit, That Law it is presumed would in all commercial cases (under certain local modifications) be the best adapted to promote the end for which all laws should be made; the general good of those who are to be governed by them, but as the tenures of the Land are founded on and derived from the French Law, and have been conveyed and sold agreeable to that Law, (or at least intended to be so) no change, ought or could in my opin-. ion be made without affecting, or even violating the Principles of Common Justice.

Question 3. 1 To what amount is annually imported into the District of Hesse, British Manufacturers or her colonies, and by what channels? Question 4 Are the Lands cultivated about Detroit and what are they fittest for? Wheat, Indian Corn, Flax, Hemp, &ca? Or are the lands fit for Agriculture on the north east side of the Straight? What timber fit for ship buildinig or fit for exportation are there on those Lakes?

Answer t 3rd. ( There is at present annually imported into the District of Hesse, to Detroit, Michilimackinac and the North West, Goods to the amount of upwards of one hundred and fifty thousand pounds sterling, all imported (except rum and a very small quantity of wampum) from Great Britain through Montreal, and thence forwarded to Detroit by way of the Lakes and to Mickilimackinac and the North West by the communication of the Grand River; and by the same channels the produce of these Goods, is reconveyed and reverts to Great Britain.Answer 4. The climate of Detroit is uncommonly good, and particularly friendly to European constitutions; the Soil of the Settlement of Detroit (that is what has been long in the hands of the French) is said to be inferior in richness to the adjacent uncultivated Land, but even it produces Wheat, Indian Corn, Peas, Oats, &c., in abundance, and almost without culture, manure of those Arts which enrich the soil, and augment the harvests in Britain-Hemp grows in many places spontaneous, and so does Hops, and it is said that Flax would also succeed, but none of these have been tried or attempted to be raised but in a very trifling de. gree. The soil on the North East side of the River is represented as very good, there is abundance of timber for the building Houses and Ships in the different parts of the Country, and along the River towards Lake St. Clair; there is also fine red cedar, on the Islands of Lake Erie where the timbers of vessels are usually cut; in

Questn. t 5. (What number of inhabitants is there in the District of iesse, and are there many more expected as settlers? Question ) 6. f What number of cultivated farms is there at present about Detroit, and what do they principally produce?

regard to the exportation of timber however fit it may be, were it in another place it is presumed the Cataract of Niagara will prove an unsurmountable bar to any enterprize of this sort, and Land carriage is out of the question.Answer t 5. 9 The District of Hesse according to the Late Patent, comprehends a very large, and even (if I recollect) an undefined territory, and therefore to this Question I cannot give a satisfactory answer, but the Settlement of Detroit comprehending the Inhabitants settled on the Rivers and Creeks near it, are computed at about four thousand, and they are increasing fast; There have been if I mistake not regular returns transmitted of their numbers to Head Quarters, and from them I presume their numbers will appear less than the popular computation because those who take them omit all those, any way distant, as on the Rivers, Creeks &c, In regard to those in other places, I cannot say what the number may be, and what I here say of the rest, is only the opinion generally received; they would encrease much faster were their Land assigned them by Government as at Niagara-indeed most.of the Lands are already claimed by individuals, as I have had the honour to mention more fully in my Letter to the Chief Judge. Answer } 6. I cannot exactly charge my memory with the number of farms, but they extend along the bank of the River, a computed distance of four miles below the fort and twelve above it, and about

When ought they to sit, and how often and at what times and seasons of the year?' how ought they to be organized or officered?

the same distance on the opposite bank, beside the new Settlement at the mouth of the River at the entrance of Lake Erie; I have already observed what the soil was fit for, what it principally produces is wheat, the farms are three acres in front and forty deep, this is the usual lot.Answr. 7 The Courts of Montreal have till the late creation of a new District had authority to administer Justice there, although we have not from the extreme distance and the intervention of a long winter, (incident to the climate) ever reaped any benefit from being within its jurisdiction; nor on mature deliberation will it ever be expected that we can. I have already spoken before the Honorable Committee of Council as to the nature of the Committee of Arbitration; and as to the administration of criminal justice, uone has been administered within the District since my residence. Answer) 8 1 A Court of Common Pleas and of Quarter Sessions (I humbly conceive with proper Judges and the most respectable Magistrate, that could be found to preside in them) would be sufficient for the Judical purposes of the District, In cases of felony &ca. no doubt a special Commission must be given for trying them. The proper residence or seat of those courts should obviously be at Detroit. As to the frequency of meeting it ought to be left at first in some degree to the discretion of those who should preside in them; and as soon as could be done and experience obtained, what times and

seasons would be most conducive to promote the end of their institution that is the ready and convenient dispensation of public Justice. A report of the same ought to be made to the Governor of the Province and the periods fixed independant of the future discretion of either Judges or Magistrates. As AMichilimackinac is distant from Detroit four hundred miles, and having few fix'd Inhabitants, it is rather like a Mart or Fair, where the business of the year is transacted in about two months, during which time the Judge for the District might be thought necessary to go there annually; however the gentlemen concerned in that Trade can give the best information. Ansr. 9th f By this Question I understand Churches, Jails, Hospitals, &c. &c. of which there are none I understand at Michilimackinac, and there are none at Detroit unless the two French Churches, for the English never had a Church in the Upper Country that I heard of. It is presumed that the Barracks of Detroit and Fort Lernouth, the Government House where the Commanding Officer usually resides, the Couhcil House where the Indians assemble and deliver their Speeches the Block Houses at different Angles of Detroit within the Picketsand the water side, the Naval Dock Yard and the necessary buildings, belonging to it, without the Pickets on the east side of the Town, it is presumed these do not in strictness come under this description.

Govr. when there was one. The war made it necessary to be circumspect in giving passes, and the exercise of this circumspection was become so great that the whole trade towards the Miamis and Country verging on the Ohio &c was confined to a monopoly of two or three particular friends of the Commandants on whose loyalty he could depend, 4s well as that of those whom they recommended; It happened by degrees to be discovered that none but those who bought their goods of them were perfectly loyal or good Subjects. Whether this was the case with regard to Michilimackinac or not, I cannot pretend to say, but I have heard that there existed too much room for such complaints at that place also; the difficulty of obtaining Passes has gradually lessened since the beginning of 1784 and at present there are none, People may go where they please on advertizing their names three days in case of Debt.

We give up a Country enriched by nature, with the finest soil and climate, accommodated with innumerable navigable Rivers and fitted to become by the exertions of industry under the protection of favourable Laws the noblest and most extensive Colony in the World; and as a necessary consequence of this Sacrifice we give up most assuredly the fur Trade, We abandon those advantages which as a commercial People are the reward of our present possessions. That Forts may be constructed and Settlements formed on the North East side of the Lakes, I readily agree, but that they could protect the Trade (I allude to the fur Trade) when the whole country where the furs are produced would be without their Command, under another Government and in the hands of a rival and Commercial People, I cannot possibly believe or foresee. Ansr. 12 The Command and Superiority of the Lakes can only be preserved by keeping up a proper naval force on them, what that naval force should be is not for me to Judge; it ought however obviously to be such as would repel such attacks as political prudence should foresee, or might have from cireumstances reason to apprehend; In regard to the Kings Vessels on the Lakes, a more accurate account of their strength, burthen, state of repairs &c. may be obtained from the Inspector and Comptroller of the marine Department than any I could possibly furnish;,

Answer t 14. )The answer to the fifth question is partly a reply to this; and I before observed that excepting Mr. Baby there is no French Nferchant in the settlement of Detroit; there are traders sent out to the Indian Country and all the Engag6s are also Canadians as well as the most part of the Farmers; they are wholly illiterate, and if we except five or six Canadian families I am justified to say (from an intercourse with, and knowledge of almost every Inhabitant near the Settlement) that there will not be found twenty people nor perhaps half the number, who have the least pretentions to education, or can even write their name or know a Letter of a Book.

As to the decision of causes by the court of arbitration, I have already mentioned it before the Honourable Committee & to the Chief Judge, and I can only consider it as a laudable but inefficacious establishment devised by urgent necessity for the exigencies of the place, but which never was intended to supercede but supply the immediate want of a Court of Law, which I consider as absolutely necessary, wherever there are men in a State of Society, and, which is most ardently desired (I presume to say) by every Inhabitant whether Canadian or English, within the District of Hesse.

"To the Committee of the Council of which Mr. Finlay is Chairman on the Memorial relating to the District of Hesse." The communication referred to in the foregoing note is as follows. To the Honourable Wm. Smith Esqr. Chief Judge of the Province of Quebec &ca. Sir, Should the following facts and observations be found to convey any useful information, or suggest such hints as your wisdom may ripen and bring to maturity for the benefit of the upper Country. I shall think myself happy of having been in the remotest degree, instrumental in imparting them. Wherever there are men, there must be Laws, to regulate their intercourse with one another, and those Laws should be calculated to promote the general good of that Society for whom they are framed. But however wisely adapted to promote this beneficient end, unless duly administered they must become as useless as ore in the mine or marble in the quarry. It is the peculiar advantage that British Subjects enjoy above other Nations to have the best Laws and the wisest and ablest Judges to interpret and dispense them. Whither the Laws of Canada which from a generous condescencion on the part of the gentle conqueror, to the ancient priviledges and usages of the vanquished, and which were intended no doubt to conciliate and incite their affections to ours, and to accommodate both them and us. Whether this System for a Commercial Province, which derives its supplies from, and is dependant on Great Britain, be the best or not, it is not here, my business to enquire or determine. But it is to be regretted that while those Laws are to be the rule of our conduct, and the only security of our property, a large portion of the Province should have been on account of its remoteness from the Seat of Justice in a manner precluded from legal protection. That this has been long the unfortunate case with the Inhabitants of the upper Country is well known. not that they stand more in need of legal caution than mankind in general do. On the contrary if we reflect on the wide extent of British Territory which usually goes under this name; on the number and various character of its Inhabitants savage and civilized, on the facility with which crimes even robbery and murder might be committed, on the temptation to commit them and the certainty of escaping with impunity to other Governments, we shall rather have reason to be surprized that so few instances of fraud or violence occur, and we shall be still more astonished, that a Property in British Goods which exceeds in value more than all the returns of the lower parts of the Province put together should be constantly in circulation in that cou try for the purpose of purchasing annually furs to the amount of one huAdred and fifty, or two Hundred thousand pounds currency; and that this property so situated should have hitherto been risked by the Mother Country

unprotected by Laws. If the Inhabitants therefore of the lower part of the Province whose trade is less beneficial to the Mother Country, than that of the upper, have Courts.of Justice to protect their Property and redress their wrongs and proper Judges to administer Law and dispense Justice, it may reasonably be hoped it must be the intention of Government to put His Majesty's Subjects in the upper Districts on a footing with their brethren in this respect. Tho' their case has long been overlooked, they flatter themselves it will now receive a serious consideration from the Legislature of this Province. They acknowledge the goodness of the intention that gave birth to the Judicial Arrangements that were made for their District now called Hesse, they were sorry to be obliged to object to it for the reasons assigned in their memorial to the noble Governor on this subject; And here I must be permitted to observe to you, that the Situation of Detroit in point of Trade is very different from that of the new Settlements below it, It is an old French Settlement, and from it and Michilimackinac all the Trade of the new Districts comprehended under the name of Hesse to the amount of one hundred and fifty, or two hundred thousand pounds Sterling is carried on, and the returns equal to this sum annually pass through these two Posts as a Payment to Great Britain for her Goods. This Therefore naturally points out Detroit as the proper residence for a Court of Judicature to dispense law and Justice to all those concerned in this valuable Trade. I cannot help observing altho' I had the honour to be nominated as one of the Judges of the Court of Common Pleas for this District that no man interested or concerned in Trade ought to have a Judicial Authority in it and for which I have already in conjunction with Mr. Baby assigned my Reasons; I also beg leave to add that none but a Judge professionally acquainted with the. Law, would be proper to preside in this Court, or could possibly be adequate to the task or give satisfaction to the people; and I humbly suggest should such a one be appointed, in order to accelerate his proceedings it might perhaps be found proper to invest him with authority to decide all causes for debt that did not exceed fifty pounds York, alone and without any appeal whatever; and to decide all causes from that to two hundred pounds York, without appeal but with a Jury. The reason of wanting no Jury in the first instance is the delay and difficulty of finding Proper persons for the multiplicity of causes that would occur under fifty pounds and which as they would mostly arise on book debts, notes or accounts, could be attended but rarely with intricate or dubious circumstances; if that should however happen ever to be the case, the Judge should (perhaps) have power to order the parties to arbitrate the point. The reason why there ought to be a Jury in causes from fifty pounds and upwards to two hundred, is because they might not only be



Page 646

supposed to involve more complicated and various matter relating to merchantile customs but even to landed property and because the verdict of a Jury would be more popular and satisfactory than that of a single Judge however upright and just, and would also make him more respected by the people by taking off and removing any imputation or suspicion of partiality which so naturally generates and spreads in small communities. In causes exceeding Two hundred Pounds York altho' also triable by a Jury it might be proper to allow an appeal to the party who should consider himself aggrieved, it would make the Judge and Jury circumspect and preserve the necessary dependance of this Court on that of Quebec, This System no doubt might be found nearly applicable to Michilimackinac, or might be so varied or modified as to be wholly so, and should the Judge make a circuit thither for about a month or six weeks in the summer it might be found fully sufficient for the whole Judicial Business of that part of the District: But as I am not so well acquainted with the nature of the Trade at that Place; I do not wish to be understood to be decided in my opinion. As almost the whole business of this District (Hesse) is now in the hands of the English, it is presumed that the Laws of England, in all commercial cases under certain local modifications, would be found the best adapted to promote the general good of those who are to be governed by them, which it must be allowed should be the scope and end of all laws. But in the Settlement of Detroit, where all the tenures of the Land are deprived from and founded on the French Law, and have been conveyed and sold agreeable to that Law (or at least intended or understood to be so) no change ought or could be made without violating the common rights of the People; It may be necessary to add, that these conveyances, sales or mortgages of Houses and landed property have been executed since the death of Mr. Thomas Williams who acted as notary and which happened about the end of 1785, a person not duly authorized as he had only a Commission or order from the Commanding Officers for this purpose and for collecting the Lots et ventes, and cens et rentes, which last service took up most of his Time, should these acts be declared void, the greatest confusion and distress would ensue to the people in general, who never suspected or knew this might be the case. It is humbly submitted to Your Superior Judgment, whether it would not be proper and right to render those sales, transfer or mortgages valid so far as they would be so had the Notary been duly authorized, and whether as he is every way a very unfit person, being ignorant of the English and even of the French Language, and from his want of a Scholastic Education unable to execute writings either in a fair hand or intelligible language a proper person ought not immediately to be commissioned as notary at Detroit. For this purpose

Mr. Thomas Smith has been often mentioned with approbation, he is a lieutenant in the Militia, acting for the present as Deputy Surveyor, but without pay or Commission as there is no body else, has been lately very Judiciously nominated Clerk of the Court of Common Pleas there; and from his Education and a knowledge of the two languages, and an opinion and confidence the people have of his principles and integrity, I presume his appointment as notary would be satisfactory for these reasons, to which may added that he is not likely to change his residence or leave the place being married and settled. I beg leave to put you in mind that His Excellency General Haldimand had caused the Register of Detroit in which regular copies of all sales, mortgages &ca. in the fort and settlement were kept, to be carried down to Quebec where it still remains; It may naturally be supposed the want of this has occasioned much perplexity, confusion and even discord, and much doubt as to the authenticity of some claims, and the existance of others; A supplementary Register was immediately opened for the entering of Subsequent Sales or Mortgages, but while Major Ancrum commanded it was said to have been stolen from the Notary's office, and has never since been found. After the sales and Mortgages have been very irregularly kept sometimes on detached sheets of paper, and sometimes on a few stitched together. It would be a very great Satisfaction to the people to have the Register back again. You will have the Goodness to remark that the Lands, Sales and Mortgages I now have been alluding to were granted, by proper authority, and all in the time of the French Government. But all the rest of the Country for a considerable distance round Detroit and even along the Lakes is claimed by different people in consequence of grants obtained or purchases made by them from the Indians. Parcels of these have again been sold out by the great proprietors to subordinate purchasers, some of whom are bound to render certain Services, make certain improvements and annually pay so much money or so much grain. As these proprietors exclude the rest of the people from cutting wood and procuring stone on all Lands of this Description, it has unfortunately happened that the only Stone quarry in that country is an Island granted in this way, and the people in the Fort and Settlement have been obliged for some years to buy all the stone and lime necessary for the foundations of their Houses, which are of wood, for their cellars, chimnies, and such purposes, of this proprietor. The freedom of Navigation on the Lakes to Merchant vessels was very thankfully received, and must be productive of great facility and advantage to the Trade, but it is hoped the Lake ordinance may be rendered still more coxidusive to this end than in its present form.

I have I fear, Sir, trespassed too long on your time, but 1 have been induced to be more minute than would have been necessary did I not conceive that the situation and character of the people of Detroit is either very little known, or seen in an imperfect and unfavorable point of view at Quebec, and I am led to this conclusion from the late nomination of several new Magistrates for that District who are altogether unqualified ana incapable to discharge the Duties of a Commissioner of the Peace. Nothing can reflect more honor on, or be more essentially useful in a community than a respectable, intelligent and well informed Magistracy, whose character, conduct, and abilities should do honor to that Government from whom they derived their authority, and who might be looked up to by the people, as men worthy of their confidence & respect, & as objects for their imitations-To advance therefore to this useful office, men of an opposite description, cannot fail to bring the Magistracy and the Laws they administer into contempt, a proper respect for both of which is highly necessary to be kept up in every Government, and still more scrupulously maintained in places so remote and Distant. It might seem invidious to descend to a minute examination of the character & capacity of some of those appointed lately as Justices of the Peace for the District of Hesse, it might wear the appearance of personale animadversion, when my intention is only to shew that they are unfit for what they have been supposed equal to; and for this purpose it will be sufficient to say their nomination was received even by themselves with surprise, and by their fellow citizens with evident signs of disapprobation; nor will this be wondered at when the strictest veracity will authorize me to say from five or six years personal knowledge of them, that three of them are very illiterate, and two of three, it is publickly known in their own District can neither Read nor write, unless a mechanical subscription of their name (the only use they ever made of a pen) may be explained to be writing. As no good or Honorable end could be answered to Government, to the public, or to the men themselves by such an accession to the Magistracy, we are fully persuaded from the character of the noble Governor of the Province and from His known and acknowledged zeal for the promotion of the prosperity, peace and happiness of all those committed to his care, that it never could be his intention to delegate authority to such persons, and we are therefore convinced they derived their commissions from the injudicious recommendation of those who did not know them, or did not reflect on the nature and duty of the office of a Magistrate. In conclusion I wish to be understood in what I have advanced that I have been guided by truth and actuated by a desire to promote the general good of the Settlement of Detroit, & trade depending thereon, a constant residence

there for upwards of six years & a very general intercourse in the way of an extensive business has given me an opportunity of becoming personally known & acquainted with every Inhabitant, Merchant & Tra4er in that Country, of knowing even their circumstances, situations & sentiments & therefore when I mention facts they may be relied upon as such & where I state opinions (except as to Michilimackinac) I may venture to say I express the general Idea of the people; but tho the facts can be incontrovertibly proved, I do not presume to affirm that the opinions, tho' I hope they will be found nearly just, are perfectly right, as the best metals are not without alloy, so 'no doubt are they free from error. I have the honor to subscribe myself most respectfully, Sir Your most obedient & very hum' Serv' (signed) WILLIAM ROBERTSON. P. S. I hope I shall be understood to have pointed out one Judge only as sufficient from an apprehension that the present system of economy would not permit the expence necessary for more, altho' in case of indisposition, sickness or death, it is obvious three would be preferable and be a greater security, that the Course of Public Justice might not be interrupted or suspended by the intervention of casualties. In regard to the Committee or Court of Arbitration that used to decide causes at Detroit for Debt &ca. I shall only remark to you that is was a local tempory expedient, dictated by extreme necessity and though its decisions were very impartial and fair and generally approved of by the People, yet possessing no coercive authority to carry its judgements into execution, it could not answer the end of a Court of Judicature, at the same time the refractory party was exposed to inconvenience and perplexity and as one consequence of his disobedience could maintain no suit till he complied. That this Court was better than none I readily admit, and tho' I much approve of the late Memorial wherein it is mentioned with approbation. I cannot Join to recommend it but as a measure of necessity. W. R.

NEWS FROM POST VINCENNES.

LORD DORCHESTER TO LORD SYDNEY. No. 93. QUEBEC, 8th November, 1788. My Lord, Advices from Detroit of the 4th of October give an account brought in there a few days before by a Trader from the neighborhood of the American Post Vincennes, that fifty horsemen from Kentucke had killed a party of ten or twelve Indians, who had been hunting for the benefit of that garrison, and lived under its protection, that the commanding officer of the post sent to remonstrate against this outrage, but that his message was treated with contempt, in consequence of which the Indians of that Vicinity finding the garrison unable to afford them safety, removed from the post, and were coming in daily to the villages at the Miamis. These circumstances seem to correspond with an other report from Detroit, of Kentucke being on the eve of a separation from Virginia. Though some of the above accounts seem to want confirmation I would not suffer the last opportunity at the close of the navigation to pass without communicating them to your Lordship. I am with much respect and esteem. Your Lordship's most obedient and most humble servant, DORCHESTER. The right Honorble Lord Sydney. Endorsed:-Quebec, 8 Novem., 1788. Lord Dorchester. Re 2 Jany, 1789, No. 98. [Q 39 p 107]. LORD DORCHESTER TO LORD SYDNEY. No 94. QUEBEC 8 November 1788. My Lord The Province of Quebec consists at present of seven districts or counties; Quebec and Montreal in the central parts, Gaspe at and near the mouth of the Saint Lawrence, and the country, west of Point au Boudet, divided into the four districts of Lunenburg, Mecklenburg, Nassau and Hesse. The Canadians or new subjects occupy the districts of Quebec and Montreal, and some are

653

also to be found in the districts of Gasp6 and Hesse. The three districts of Lunenburg, Mecklenburg, and Nassau, are inhabited only by the loyalists, or old subjects of the Crown. The Commerce of the Country being chiefly carried on by the English occasions a considerable mixture of inhabitants in the towns of Quebec and Montreal, nearly in the proportion of one British to two Canadians, Some of the former are also settled at Three rivers, Terrebonne, William Henry, Saint Johns, and the entrance of Lake Champlain, and a small number are disperced among the Canadians in the Country parishes; the fur trade has collected some hundreds at Detroit, as the fisheries have at the bay of Chaleurs, and other parts of the district of Gasp6. The proportions of British and Canadians in the two districts of Quebec and Montreal, exclusive of the towns, may be about one to forty, in the same districts, inclusive of the towns, one to fifteen, in the district of Hesse one to three, in the district of Gasp6 two to three, and in the whole province, taken together about one to five. A change of the laws and form of Government, by the infroduction of an assembly, is chiefly promoted by the commercial part of the community, in the towns of Quebec and Montreal. The Canadian Habitans, or farmers, who may be stiled the main body of the freeholders of the country, having little or no education, are unacquainted with the nature of the question, and would, I think, be for, or against it, according to their confidence in the representations of others. The Clergy do not appear to have interfered. But the Canadian gentlemen in general are opposed to the measure; they object to the introduction of a body of new laws, to the extent and tendency of which they are strangers; they express apprehensions of much disquietude among the people from the introduction of an assembly, and conceive that the low state of learning and knowledge in the country would lay them open to the pursuit and adoption of wrong measures, and to dangers, which a more enlightened people would not be exposed to. The fear of taxation, I take for granted, is among the motives of those, who are adverse to the change, and would no doubt strongly influence the sentiments of the common people, if they should come to consider the merits of the question. The objections, "which appear to exist to a farther introduction of the trial by jury, arise partly from prejudice, and partly from an idea, that the choice would be narrow, and under it difficult to find jurors, totally disinterested. In addition to these observations, it may be proper to mention, that the population of this country is chiefly confined to the margin of the waters from the western side of the gulph of Saint Lawrence in the district of Gaspe, to the settlements at and above Detroit, a chain of not less than eleven hundred miles; and that, though the ancient settled parts of the districts of



Page 654
654

RELATIVE TO ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE.

Quebec and Montreal, from Kamaraska to Point au Boudet (comprehending about thre hundred and seventy miles of the above line) may find no great burthen in the expence of a representation, it may be otherwise with the inhabitants newly set down in Gaspe, Lunenburg, Mecklenburg, Nassau, and Hesse, and that the inconveniences and charges of assembling, from parts so distant, would be increased by the nature of the climate, which renders the roads for several months in the year difficult, if not impracticable. A division of the province, I am of opinion, is by no means advisable at present, either for the interests of the new, or the ancient districts, nor do I see an immediate call for other regulations, than such as are involved in the subject of the general jurisprudence of the country. Indeed it appears to me, that the western settlements are as yet unprepared for any organization, superior to that of a county. This has lately been given to them, and will, I trust, answer their present wants, if I except Hesse, whose commercial and complicated affairs call for a particular provision, now under the consideration of a Committee of the Council. But though I hold a division of the province at present inexpedient, yet I am of opinion, that no time should be lost in appointing a person of fidelity and ability, in the confidence of the loyalists, to superintend, and lead them, and to bring their concerns with dispatch to the knowledge of government, under the title of Lieutenant Governor of the four districts above named. Should a division of the province notwithstanding, be determined by the wisdom of His Majesty's Councils, I see no reason, why the inhabitants of those western districts should not have an assembly, as soon as it may be organized without detriment to their private affairs; nor against their having so much of the English system of laws, as may suit their local situation, and condition. But in this case particular care should be taken to secure the property and civil rights of the Canadian Settlers at Detroit, who, I am convinced, would not chuse to emigrate, though good lands might be given them in the lower parts of the province. But should they chuse to move, it would be attended with much inconvenience, as would their being left insulated, and attached to the district of Montreal. With respect to proper limits for the new government, in the event of a separation, I would recommend those described in the annexed paper, which will comprehend all the settlements of the loyalists on theriver Saint Lawrence above Point au Boudet, and those also lately laid out for them on the south side of the Uttawas river. I am with much respect & esteem, Your Lordship's most obedient, and most humble servant, DORCHESTER. The Right Hon"bi Lord Sydney Endorsed: Quebec 8 Novem 1788 Lord Dorchester No Ot R 2 Jany. 1789.

REPORTS. Administration of ) Justice in the District of Hesse. The Reports of the private committee and of the committee of the whole council concerning the administration of Justice in the District of Hesse, read, as follows, viz.:.The Report of the Private Committee. To His Excellency the Right Honorable Lord Dorchester Commander in Chief of His Majesty's Forces in North America, and Governor General of the Provinces of Quebec, Nova Scotia, and New Brunswick, &c., &c., &c. The committee appointed by your Lordship in Council to consider the Memorial of divers Inhabitants of the District of Hesse, touching the administration of Justice there, and to confer with Mr. Robertson of Detroit then in Quebec, having maturely considered the said Memorial, and duly weighed the information given by Mr. Robertson in his-answers to the questions, proposed by the Committee, together with his letter to the Honorable Chief Justice Smith, and being by other means instructed. Most Humbly Report, that the great importance of the extensive Commerce carrried on through the passes of Detroit and Michilimackinac with the numerous Nations of Indians, inhabiting the Western and Northern parts of this Province, calls for immediate attention from Government; the annual circulating stock employed by the Merchants concerned in that traffic, amounting, at a fair computation, to upwards of Two Hundred thousands Pounds Sterling of the Manufactures of Great Britain, chiefly, and the returns for those articles being yearly shipped to England in Beaver, in Peltries, and in furs. It appears to the committee that Judicial regulation is requisite for the conduct of such extensive Commercial dealing, to direct the Traders and people employed in its different Branches; and they humbly submit to your Lordship, whether it is not indispensably necessary forthwith to fill up the vacancies occasioned by the Resignation of Messieurs Robertson & Baby? And in order to induce Gentlemen of Law-Abilities, and possessing knowledge in the custom of Merchants, to undertake an employment to which all their time with much studious application must be given, whether it will not be requisite for your Lordship to annex Salaries, or such certain and permanent provision for their support, as the dignity and importance of their stations require. Fees alone, in the opinion of the Committee, will not for many years be adequate to the expence that must necessarily attend the office of Judge in that very important Commercial i)istrict, where, as yet, the necessarys of life bear a high price. The Judges of Hesse may probably havo

a yearly journey of upwards of three hundred miles to make, from Detroit Michilimakinac, there to remain two months during the time of their great annual Mart. Michilimakinsc is the Emporium where Equipments are made, and from whence canoes are yearly dispatched by the Traders, to very remote Regions extending to the Westward and Northward, on Commercial speculation. The Committee further humbly submit to your Lordship the propriety of nominating Mr. Thomas Smith of Detroit to the employment of a Public Notary; he is well recommended by Mr. Robertson and others:-and they humbly recommend that Your Lordship's Commission may issue to Mr. Montforton, who at present, and for several years has officiated in the Capacity of a notary under the appointments of the Lieutenant Governors or officers commanding at Detroit. We are persuaded that your Lordship in your goodness will not allow the hardship which the Land-holders in the Settlement of Detroit suffer from being deprived of the Archives or Register of their Title Deeds, to continue: their tranquility depends on its safe and speedy return, for the security of their property. The Committee will proceed to consider of such Bill or Bills as would in their conception promote the prosperity of the District of Hesse; but apprehending it to be necessary, in the mean time to lay before Your Lordship their opinion founded on the information they have received from Mr. Robertson, and by other Channels, they must humbly submit this report, that Your Lordship may order therein as to your great wisdom may seem meet. By order of the Committee. (signed) HUGI FINLAY Chairman Council Chamber 1 14th November 1788 [Q 41 part I page 87]
