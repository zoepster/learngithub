PREFACE During the year 1908, upon the recommendation of the Advisory Commission of the Illinois State His- torical Library the collection of the letters and papers of George Rogers Clark was begun. The present volume, the third of the Virginia Series, contains all the available Clark papers prior to November, 1781. The remainder of this material will be published in a fourth volume which is to follow; and it is planned to complete the series with a fifth volume on the finan- ciering of the Revolution in the West, dealing especially with the contributions and influence of Oliver Pollock. In addition to the Clark papers, it has seemed best to include many letters written to and about Clark which have not heretofore been printed and which are believed to be essential to the explanation of his work. The aim throughout has been to interpret events connected with the chief phases of the Revolution in the West. The general arrangement of the docu- ments has been chronological though some exceptions occur, as in the case of the Memoir, where the docu- ments describe the conditions of a period other than that in which they were written. The division into chapters is purely artificial and is done for typographical purposes. Nor have all the topics of the chapters been mentioned in the headings. On page 639 will be found a complete list of the printed documents, and on page 631 the full titles of books to which reference has been made. With but few exceptions, the documents have been 111

INTRODUCTION I. CONTEST FOR INDIAN ALLIANCE From the opening of the Revolutionary War, Ameri- can leaders desired the conquest of Detroit, the head- quarters of the posts and the key to the fur trade and to the control of the Indian tribes northwest of the Ohio. Throughout the war this post, in the possession of the British, continued, as Washington wrote, “to be a constant source of trouble to the whole Western country.” The garrison at Detroit, at the beginning of the year 1776, consisted of one hundred and twenty soldiers under the command of Captain Richard B. Lernoult. The fort was defended by a “Stocade of Picquets about 9 Feet out of the earth, without Frize or ditch.” Three hundred and fifty French and English made up the entire number of fighting men in the 'Amer. Archives, 4th ser., iii., 1368; Mich. Pioneer and Hist. Coll., xxvii., 61.2 et seq. From this post, a trace led westward by way of the Maumee and across the upper Wabash to Post Vincennes. In like manner, an Indian path extended to #. and other posts on the upper Mississippi. Not only was it a great center for the fur trade, but in years of good harvests flour and grain were furnished to other posts from Detroit. (Draper MSS., 46J9.) The post was of great importance during the French regime. Indians from the North- west took part, in common with Canadians, in the battle on the Plains of Abraham. June 29, 1759, a courier announced that there were about to arrive one hundred French and one hundred and fifty Indians from Detroit; six hundred to seven hundred Indians with M. Linctot, one hundred Indians with M. Rayeul, and the convoy of M. Aubry from Illinois with six hundred to seven hundred Indians. Twelve hundred other Indians from the same region were also reported to be on the way. Iſis. IIist. Coll., xviii., 212. *Washington, Writings (Sparks ed., vii., 345. xiii

Commanding the fort were two British armed schooners and three sloops manned by thirty “seamen and ser- vants.” There was not a single gunner among the crews who were dissatisfied with the service and incapable of making much resistance. Three hundred miles away to the southeast was Fort Pitt, the only American fortification (1775) guarding the long frontier stretching from Greenbrier, in southwestern Virginia, to Kittanning on the upper Allegheny.” This fort was without a garrison. The inhabitants of the town were dependent on the protec- tion of the militia of the neighboring counties and large numbers were reported to be in a most defenseless condition.” From these two centers, in council after council, was to be exercised all the diplomatic finesse of white men in their attempts to gain control over the Indians of the Northwest. Assembled at some of these con- ferences were the chiefs and other representatives of the Delawares of the Muskingum and the Ohio; the Shawnee and Mingo of the Scioto; the Wyandot, Ottawa and Potawatomi of Lake Michigan; the *Thwaites and Kellogg, Revolution on the Upper Ohio, 147 et seq. Lieutenant- Governor Hamilton arrived November 9, 1775, but Captain Lernoult com- manded the troops until the summer of 1776. The total population in 1773 was about 1,400; 298 of them men (Mich. Pioneer and Hist. Coll., ix., 649). The population in 1778 was 2,144, 564 being men.

All told, the northwestern tribes numbered some eight thousand warriors." Even before the actual outbreak of hostilities, leaders on both sides were considering the Indian as a factor in the contest. In March, 1775, the Provincial Con- gress of Massachusetts accepted the proffered services of a number of the Stockbridge Indians and enlisted them as minute-men.” Colonel Guy Johnson, obedient to orders, removed dissenting missionaries from among the Iroquois. One of these men, Samuel Kirkland, who had been forbidden to return to his post among the Oneida, declared that in attempting to keep the Indians neutral his interpretaticn of the acts of Con- gress to the sachems “had done more real good to the cause of the country or the cause of truth and justice than five hundred pounds of presents would have effected.” Through him the Massachusetts Pro- vincial Congress, April 4, 1775, appealed to the Iroquois to whet their hatchets and be prepared together with the colonists to defend their liberties and lives." It was declared that since the colonists were to be 'Delawares and Munsee six hundred, Shawnee six hundred, Wyandot three hundred, Ottawa six hundred, Chippewa five thousand, Potawatomi four hundred, Kickapoo, Vermilion and other small tribes of the Wabash eight hundred, Miami or Pickawillance three hundred, Mingo of Pluggy's Town Scioto River) sixty.

It is not certain which of the urgent invitations issued in May, 1775 by Colonel Guy Johnson' and by Ethan Allen to take up arms, met with the earliest response. The latter wrote to some of the Canadian tribes:” “I want to have your warriours come and see me, and help me fight the King's Regular Troops. You know they stand all along close together, rank and file, and my men fight so as Indians do, and I want your warriours to join with me and my warriours, like broth- ers, and ambush the Regulars: if you will, I will give you money, blankets, tomahawks, knives, paint, and any- thing that there is in the army, just like brothers; and I will go with you into the woods to scout; and my men and your men will sleep together, and eat and drink together, and fight Regulars, because they first killed our brothers.” “Ye know my warriours must fight, but if you our brother Indians do not fight on either side, we will still be friends and brothers; and you may come and hunt in our woods, and come with your canoes in the lake, and let us have venison at our forts on the lake, and have rum, bread, and what you want and be like brothers.” At first the general American policy tended towards securing Indian neutrality, which was clearly stated by the Continental Congress in a speech prepared for the Six Nations early in July, 1775. The war was *Amer. Archives, 4th ser., ii., 665. *This letter was written from Crown Point, May 24, 1775. Ibid., 713.

CONTEST FOR INDIAN ALLIANCE xvii declared to be a family quarrel between the colonists and Old England, in which the Indians were in no way concerned. It was urged that they should remain at home and not join on either side, but “keep the hatchet buried deep." Since, however, they were apprehensive of the policy to be pursued by the British three departments of Indian affairs were created, to be under the control of commissioners, whose duties were to treat with the Indians in order to preserve their peace and friendship and prevent their taking part in the present commotions. They were to superintend also the distribution of such arms, ammunition, and clothing as were essential to the Indians' existence.” Within a year, however, a resolution was passed that it was highly expedient to engage the Indians in the Service of the united colonies and especially to secure their co-operation in bringing about the reduction of Detroit. Notwithstanding the arraignment of the British in the Declaration of Independence for the en- listment of savages, Congress granted Washington full power to use Indians as auxiliaries and to offer them hounties for all their prisoners.” In a dispatch to Congress, Colonel George Morgan outlined the plan which, in general, was pursued by Indian agents of the best type on the frontier. “We July 13, 1775. *July 12, 1775, Amer. Archives, 4th ser., ii., 1879. The three departments were Northern, Middle and Southern. The Northern Department included the Six Nations and all other Indians north of these tribes. The Southern included the Cherokee and other southern tribes. The Middle, all Indians between the territory of the two others. There were to be five commissioners for the Southern and three each for the two other departments. *Journals Cont. Cong. (new ed.), Iv., 395. The commissioners were in- structed, May 25, 1776, to offer an inducement of £50 Pennsylvania cur- fency for every prisoner (soldier of the garrison) brought to them. The Indians were to be given the free plunder d; the garrison. On June 17, 1776, Washington was authorized to employ Indians. Ibid., v., 452.

xviii ILLINOIS HISTORICAL COLLECTIONS shall ever hold it our duty,” he wrote, “to exert our ut- most influence to prevent hostilities, and to promote peace and Harmony with the Indian Tribes. . . . . The cheapest and most humane mode of obtaining an alli- ance with the savages is by buying of their Friendship; they have been long taught by contending Nations to be bought and sold. . . . . We are well satisfied we can bestow our Country no service more essential to her Interest, than by restraining the hostilities of the Indians, and giving ease to the minds of our Frontier Inhabitants.” Indeed, this was the safest course to pursue, for on the frontiers constant danger from retaliatory attacks outweighed any assistance which might be secured through the enlistment of Indians. The British early employed the savages to cut off outlying settlements. Under plea that the “rebels” had used Indians in their hostilities on the frontier of Quebec, after the capture of Ticonderoga, and that they had brought Indians for the attack on Boston, General Gage urged that General Carleton might be privileged to use Canadians and Indians for a counter stroke.” The letter which followed, containing “His Majesty's commands for engaging a body of Indians,” and promis- ing a large assortment of goods for presents, was of form merely. On the day it was written, five hundred Indians were brought to Montreal to join the English army.” Thereafter, the British were to enlist the savages for service with the regular army as well as to 'Morgan, Letter Book, II., July 30, 1776. *General Gage to Lord Dartmouth, June 12, 1775.

CONTEST FOR INDIAN ALLIANCE xix employ them with more terrible results in cutting off outlying settlements and raiding the frontiers. There was necessity for prompt action on the part of the Americans in order that they might gain the friendship of the tribes beyond the Ohio. In the pro- visional treaty at Camp Charlotte, Governor Dunmore promised the Indians that he would return in the spring and bring it to completion. By that time, the Revolu- tionary movement had assumed such proportions that he deemed it inadvisable to risk a journey to the frontier. Once more he found a ready agent in Dr. John Connolly, a bold, enterprising, restless character who had been left in command of the garrison of seventy- five men at Fort Dunmore. In a conference at Williamsburg in February, Major Connolly was in- structed by Lord Dunmore to use his efforts to induce the Indians to espouse the cause of Great Britain. In this he succeeded, in so far as he brought together at Pittsburgh the chiefs of the Delawares and a few Mingo, whom he assured that a general treaty, with presents, was soon to be held with all the Ohio Indians.” Disbanding the garrison in July, he returned to find Governor Dunmore a fugitive on board a man-of-war off York. Together, they concocted a plan fraught with grave consequences for the back country and for the American cause in general. In a personal inter- view, Connolly won the assent of General Gage to the plan and received instructions for its development.” It was designed that Connolly should proceed to *Pu.

xx ILLINOIS HISTORICAL COLLECTIONS Detroit, where he was to command the garrison from Fort Gage, led by Captain Hugh Lord. This nucleus of an army, together with the French and Indians of Detroit, was to proceed to Fort Pitt. It was hoped that this force would be enhanced by the Ohio Indians, for whom liberal presents were provided, and by numbers of the militia from Augusta County, who for their loyalty were to have three hun- dred acres of land confirmed to each of them. Forts Pitt and Fincastle were to be destroyed, should they offer re- sistance, and the expedition was then to take and fortify Fort Cumberland and capture Alexandria, assisted by troops led by Dunmore and landed under protection of the ships of war. The southern colonies were in this manner to be cut off from the northern. Conditions promised well for the success of the enterprise. Connolly had won the favor of the Indians; Fort Pitt, as already noted, was in a condition to offer but little defense; and the backwoodsmen were with- out the necessary equipment in arms and ammunition to obstruct such an expedition. They were disunited, also, because of the Pennsylvania and Virginia boun- dary dispute. A letter from Connolly to a supposed friend at Pittsburgh led to his betrayal. Virginia authorities were informed of the intrigue and runners bearing orders for his arrest were sent out from all the southern provinces into the Indian nations through which he purposed to pass. He and three associates were captured near Hagerstown, while on their way to Fort Pitt.2 *Amer. Archives, 4th ser, III., 1543. *.Y copy ºf the plan was in their possession.

CONTEST FOR INDIAN ALLIANCE xxi For upwards of two years thereafter, the frontier was free from any general participation in the war. Meantime, immigration to the West continued, and the contest went on between British and American agents for ascendency over the Indians of that region. Major Connolly had conducted his treaty with the Indians at Pittsburgh in the presence of the committee of correspondence of West Augusta County.” The provisions and goods furnished by the committee on that occasion assisted materially in gaining the good- will of the Indians for later negotiations. A petition to Congress from the committee followed at an early date setting forth their fears of a rupture with the Indians on account of the late conduct of Governor Dunmore and asking that commissioners from Pennsyl- vania and Virginia be appointed to confer with the Indians at Pittsburgh.” On June 24, therefore, six commissioners were appointed by Virginia for the purpose of making a treaty with the Ohio Indians and a sum of £2,000 was appropriated for that purpose. Captain James Wood, one of the commissioners well versed in frontier affairs, was delegated to visit the tribes and extend to them an invitation to attend the conference at Pittsburgh. He was likewise to explain the dispute to the Indians, make them sensible of the great unanim- ity of the colonies and “Assure them of our Peaceable Intentions towards them and that we did not stand in need of or desire any Assistance from them.” : More “cabin improvements” were made in 1776 than in any other year.

xxii ILLINOIS HISTORICAL COLLECTIONS The day following, Captain Wood set out from Williamsburg on his hazardous journey of two months, accompanied by Simon Girty,’ his sole companion, who acted as interpreter. The report made on his re- turn was not wholly promising for the cause he repre- sented. His reception by the Delawares, Shawnee, and other tribes was friendly, for the fear excited by the battle of Point Pleasant was still upon them.” He learned, however, that two British emissaries had already presented belts and strings of wampum to seventeen nations, inviting them to unite with the French and English against the Virginians.” They were warned that an attack by the “Big Knives” was imminent from two directions—by the Ohio and by the Great Lakes. The Virginians were a distinct people, they were assured, and an attack upon them would in no case be resented by the other colonies. Besides, the invitation to a treaty which would be extended to them should, under no conditions, be accepted as the representatives who were to meet at Pittsburgh could not be depended upon. Similar advice was given the tribes of the upper Allegheny River, brought together at Niagara. Many of these Indians, at the instigation of Governor Carleton and Guy Johnson, were induced to go to Albany and many more to Montreal to join the British armies. 'Simon Girty was born in Pennsylvania in 1741. As a boy, he was captured by the Indians and lived with them for three years. He later became chief of the Delaware tribe. At the opening of the Revolution he was engaged in enlisting men for the American army, but in 1778, he joined the British at Detroit. During the remainder of the war he was a leader of numerous Indian attacks against the frontier settlements and was greatly feared and hated.

CONTEST FOR INDIAN ALLIANCE xxiii The Virginia commissioners, together with those appointed by Congress, assembled at Pittsburgh September 10. Thus, notwithstanding English oppo- sition' which in a measure had been overcome by traders, chiefs and delegates from the Seneca, Dela- wares, Wyandot, Mingo and Shawnee gathered slowly for the conference. Each tribe on arrival was received with “Drum and Colours and a Salute of small Arms from the Garrison.” During a period of three weeks, the commissioners strove by speech and through presents of clothing and strings of wampum to convince the Indians that they should keep the hatchet buried and use all endeavor to induce the Six Nations and other tribes to remain absolutely neutral. They were assured that the cause of Virginia was the cause of all America. “In this dispute,” they said, “your Interest is Involved with ours so far as this, that in Case those People with whom we are Contending shou'd Subdue us, your Lands, your Trade, your Liberty and all that is dear to you must fall with us, for if they wou'd Distroy our flesh and Spill our Blood which is the same with theirs; what can you who are no way related to or Con- nected with them Expect? . . . . we are not Affraid these People will Conquer us, they Can't fight in our Country, and you Know we Can; we fear not them, nor any Power on Earth.” In the event of American success, they declared, with true American assurance, they would be so in- censed against those Indians who fought against them, *Amer.

To convince the Indians still further of their invincibility, they asserted that the Indian tribes at the North were ready to become their allies, and that the people of Canada, with the exception of a few of Governor Carleton's fools, were friendly to the American cause.” The natives were invited to send their children to be educated among the white people without expense to themselves.” No little trouble was experienced in inducing the Indians to agree to surrender all prisoners and negroes and deliver up stolen horses. This done, peace “to endure forever” was established. That these children of the woods were greatly divided and at a loss how to act is in no way surprising. Promises of the British emissaries for a successful issue of their arms were presented in a fashion quite as alluring. Shortly after it was concluded, Licutenant- Governor Hamilton learned of the treaty through an Indian who was present and a Frenchman who had been stationed within ten miles of Pittsburgh. The special mission of this Frenchman was to discover the effect of the treaty upon the savages and to neutralize the results wherever possible." Hamilton felt convinced that any treaty which might have been made would endure for a brief period only, on account of the “haughty, violent dispositions" of the Virginians. But arms, ammunition, rum and other presents in ever- "Amer. Archives, 5th ser., ii., 518. *Thwaites and Kellogg, Rev. on Upper Ohio, 95. *Amer.

That the colonists might make a show of presents at first but that they would be unable to furnish the different nations with their necessary wants was an argument shrewdly used by British officials, for the savages had already become aware of American poverty. Threats to send canoe-loads of goods back to Montreal were effective whips upon such tribes as might show any disposition to waver. But the jealousy of the Indians was most quickly aroused by accounts of encroachments upon their lands. The contest for their alliance brought out what seemed to the Indians to be two distinct policies. Congress decreed that no encroachments should be made upon the line agreed upon at Fort Stanwix.” The commissioners at Pittsburgh declared it to be their purpose not to encroach on Indian lands and to retain only the tracts acquired by treaty.” It became increasingly difficult for the authorities to keep faith with the Indians since the acquisition of extensive tracts of their lands beyond the fixed boun- dary was continuous.” Frontiersmen continued to push the settled area forward in total disregard of “What I mentioned to you on the subject of Expenses,” General Carleton wrote to Hamilton, October 6, 1776," was in consequence of Instructions from the Treasury, but it was not intended to limit you with regard to such as are abso- lutely necessary for putting your Postin a properstate of defence, and for keep- ing the Indians in readiness for, and a disposition to act as circumstances shall require."

To this end parties were formed for the purpose of killing Indians on their way for a friendly visit and for way- laying hunters on their own lands Scouting parties employed by the county-lieutenants on the Monongahela and the Ohio were guilty of acts of lawlessness' which pointed to a premeditated design to bring on general hostilities. According to an English proclamation, no deeds to lands were considered valid until they were passed by the authority of the chief governor, registered at Quebec and entered at the office in Detroit. Governor Hamilton declared at the close of the year 1778 that he had never granted lands at Detroit.” He said: “As there has been a restraint laid upon the granting land to the settlers at this place, whose farms are small and families numerous, the consequence has been, young men growing to age engage as Canoe men, go off to distant settlements and in general become vaga- bonds, so that the settlement does not increase in num- bers as may be seen by comparing the recensment of 1776 with that of 1766.”3 The attention of the Indians was called to the fact, of which they were already well aware, that the “Big Knife” had been pushing them back for many years and would not rest until he was possessed of all this "Thwaites and Kellogg, Rev. on Upper Ohio, 27, 34.

CONTEST FOR INDIAN ALLIANCE xxvii country. The origin of the following message, there- fore, from the Six Nations and Chippewa to the Virginians and Pennsylvanians, early in the year 1777, may be easily discerned.” “You have feloniously taken Possession of part of our Country on the branches of the Ohio, as well as the Susquehanna, to the latter (Pennsylvanians] we have some time since sent you word to quit our Lands as we now do to you, as we don't know we ever give you liberty, nor can we be easy in our minds while there is an arm'd Force at our very doors, nor do we think you, or anybody else would—Therefore to use you with more lenity than you have a right to expect, we now tell you in a peace- ful manner to quit our Lands wherever you have possessed yourselves of them immediately, or blame yourselves for whatever may happen.” Another significant problem considered by the com- missioners was the means of capturing Detroit. A plan outlined by Arthur St. Clair proposed a volunteer expedition for the surprise of Detroit, providing it should not be opposed by the Indians.” Because of the approval of the project by his associates, St. Clair proceeded to raise five hundred men for the expedi- tion. They were to furnish their own horses and provisions. Ammunition, which could not be pro- cured in that section, was to be provided at the expense of the government. The proposal was dis- cussed in Congress but the season was thought too far 'Morgan, Letter Book, I., February 2, 1777. St. Clair was acting as secretary for the commissioners. He supposed it was due to this plan that he received his first appointment as colonel by Cºngress. Smith, St. Clair Papers, I., 15; St. Clair, Campaign against the Indians, 1791, p. 233.

Be- sides there was a feeling generally prevalent that Arnold was about to capture Quebec and as a result that Canada and the West would come into possession of the Americans. Washington shared this view and it is probable his attitude led to the disapproval of St. Clair's plan by Congress. “The acquisition of Canada,” he wrote to General Schuyler, “is of immeas- urable importance to the cause we are engaged in. . . . . If you carry your arms to Montreal, should not the garrisons of Niagara, and Detroit &c., be called upon to surrender or threatened with the consequences of a refusal? They may, indeed, destroy their stores, and, if the Indians are aiding, escape to Fort Chartres; but it is not very probable.” That expedition failing, a committee of Congress was instructed to prepare plans for an expedition against Detroit with an estimate of the expense.” General Charles Lee urged the absolute necessity of straining every nerve to possess Niagara, if not Detroit." The committee recommended that an ex- pedition should be sent immediately against Detroits for it was understood that the one hundred and twenty soldiers in that garrison were indifferent, the French neutral and the Indians wavering." Final action was postponed, however, until the arrival of 'Amer. Archives, 4th ser., III., 717. *Letter of November 5, 1775. Ibid., 1368.

MORGAN vs. HAMILTON While the treaty at Pittsburgh had been made, in the language of its text, to last “until the sun shall shine no more, or the waters fail to run in the Ohio,” both of these reverses of nature seem to have taken place in the Indian imagination by the following spring. In the meantime, they had been visited by British agents to secure their adherence.” The trails to Detroit were well worn by the tribes assembled there to meet Hamilton who strove in every possible way to excite the Indians to take up the hatchet." To this end, British officers were generous with their presents and lavish in their hospitality, partaking with the Indians in the feast of roast ox, and, as the Indians said, “recovering their dead anew with rum.” Various desultory expeditions by the Indians kept the frontiers in continuous alarm. During the con- ference at Pittsburgh, wandering bands of Wyandot and Mingo went to the mouth of the Kentucky, “to look at the White people.” On their return, they shot two white boys at Boonesborough.

Congress, early in April, appointed Colonel George Morgan Indian agent for the Middle Department. The choice was a wise one. For a number of years he had been a trader in the Illinois country where he had become noted among the Indians for his generosity and strict honesty. No man of the time better under- stood the methods necessary in winning the friendship of the western tribes. He was instructed to forward at once the great belt presented to the Indians at Pitts- burgh.” The commissioners for the Middle Department were directed to conclude a treaty with the western tribes at the earliest convenient time. Morgan was, so far as possible, to adjust all differences through arbitration” and, in the language of the instructions: “Inspire them with sentiments of Justice and human- ity, and dispose them to introduce the arts of civil and social life, and to encourage the residence of husband- men and handicrafts men among them." In pursuance of this general policy, assurance had already been given to the Delawares by Congress, upon the request of their chief, that in addition to the establishment of satisfactory trade relations and the protection of their right to the lands," there should be sent to them a schoolmaster, a Christian minister * Morgan, Letter Book, II., August 7, 1776. *Journals Cont.

Arriving at Pittsburgh, May 16, 1776, Morgan, in his endeavor to prevent the attendance of the Indians at a council called by Hamilton at Detroit, proceeded at once to the Shawnee towns.” William Wilson, a trader who accompanied Morgan, extended the invi- tation to other tribes to assemble at Pittsburgh, September 10, for the purpose of making a treaty. No incident better illustrates the situation which Americans were forced to meet in these critical pre- liminary years than Wilson's reception by Hamilton. With three companions, Wilson, upon invitation of the Wyandot, visited their village opposite Detroit and delivered to the chiefs the speech and belt sent by Morgan.” Hamilton having expressed the desire to speak with him in a friendly manner, Wilson accom- panied the chiefs to Detroit. In explaining the mes- sage to the Indians, Hamilton declared that the people who sent it were enemies and traitors to his king and that he would prefer to lose his right hand rather than take one of them by the hand. Tearing the speech and cutting the belt to pieces he then spoke to the assembled Indians on a tomahawk belt. White Eyes, chief of the Delawares, who accompanied Wilson, was ordered to leave Detroit before sunset, “as he re- garded his head.” Wilson, likewise, was directed to leave at once, receiving a parting word from the governor, which was well calculated to excite fear *Sºrºch (April 10, 1776) to Captain White Eyes, who had passed the winter in Philadelphia.

In reporting the affair, Wilson thus quoted Hamilton's remarks: “He would be glad if I would inform the people on my return of what I had seen; that all the Indians I saw there at the treaty were of the same way of think- ing; and that he would be glad if the people would con- sider the dreadful consequences of going to war with so terrible an enemy, and accept the King's pardon while it could be obtained.” Hamilton then informed Wilson that an army of twenty thousand men were landed in Canada, had driven the rebels entirely out of that government and were pursuing them to the southward; that twenty thousand more were landed in New York and the same number to the southward, with the completest train of artillery that every came out of Europe on any occasion; and that the king's triumph was assured." The summer months were full of foreboding for the now terror-stricken frontiersmen. Six hundred Chero- 1<ee were reported as being ready to strike the Virginia frontier with a determination to kill or make prisoners of all the people. These savages had also accepted the war-belt from the Shawnee and Mingo, and agreed to fall on the Kentucky settlements.” A general con- federation of all the western tribes was reported, whose purpose was to destroy all frontier settlements” as soon as their scattered young men could be called in and *Amer.

In a speech to the Mingo, the most desperate of savage tribes, Hamilton is said to have stirred up their most brutal instincts. As he delivered to them the toma- hawk, bullets and powder, having previously taken part as usual with his officers in the war-song, he declared:" "That he wonder'd to see them so foolish as not to ob- serve that the Big Knife was come up very near to them, & claimed one half the water in the Ohio, & that if any of the Indians cross'd over to their side of the River they immediately took him, laid his head on a Big Log & chopp'd it off—that he had now put them in a way to prevent such Usage, & that if they met any of them they should strike their Tomahawks into their heads, cutt off some of the hair & bring it to him.” It was suspected that fifteen hundred Chippewa and Ottawa were rendezvousing with the intention of attacking Fort Pitt." Driven to desperation, back- woodsmen forsook their clearings and evacuated the country for two hundred miles except at certain places where some of them forted.” At the time, the frontier defense was entrusted to one hundred men at Fort Pitt, one hundred at Big Kanawha, and twenty-five at Wheeling, all in the pay of Virginia. These numbers were far too meager for the purpose, much less were they suitable for any offen- sive warfare." Messengers were dispatched to Congress "Mich. Pioneer and Hist.

But notwith- standing the defenseless condition of the frontier, apprehension was so widespread lest the savages should destroy their homes during their absence, that the militia was gotten together only after great delay," many absolutely refusing the draft.” Not until the six hundred and forty-four warriors and chiefs representing the Six Nations, Delawares, Munsee and Shawnee assembled at Pittsburgh, was it known for what purpose they came. The conference served to dissipate the widespread gloom, for these Indian envoys promised “inviolable peace with the United States and neutrality during the war with Great Britain.''” Twelve chiefs were induced to visit Phila- delphia, where they were introduced to Congress.

Early in the year, British authorities began to employ more aggres- sive measures with the view of distressing the frontiers of Virginia and Pennsylvania as much as possible and with the hope that the main American army would be weakened through the withdrawal of forces to meet this attack. September 2, 1776, Hamilton proposed the employment of Indians for this purpose. The British government received the recommendation with favor and orders were sent General Carleton directing him to employ every means “that Providence has put into His Majesty's Hands, for crushing the Rebellion & - It has been estimated that there were some seventy families included in . band.

Although warbands were exhorted to act vigorously, they were urged to act with humanity. But resolutions voiced by the chiefs to pay strict atten- tion to the injunction that they should spare the blood of the aged and of women and children were idle. Special presents for proofs of obedience signified little.* The conduct of affairs at Detroit was left almost entirely to the judgment of Lieutenant-Governor Hamilton and he was informed that the power of the sword was alone to be trusted." By September, 1777, his power was absolute. He reported in July that fifteen bands of savages had been sent by him to raid the frontiers. In isolated localities, too remote for warning, men were killed or captured while at work in *Letter of Lord George Germain, March 26, 1777 in Mich. Pioneer and Hist. Coll., Ix., 347.

Hard pressed by their pursuers, the Indians killed such prisoners as hindered their rapid retreat. Thus the tomahawk saved them from sharing in the fate of their companions which was frequently more cruel. Upon arrival at an Indian village men prisoners were forced at times to satisfy the cruel instincts of their captors by running the gauntlet or were burned at the stake. Some were sold to British and French traders and later effected their escape or were ransomed. Women were compelled to become the wives or slaves of the warriors and children were adopted into the tribe. That Lieutenant-Governor Hamilton offered rewards for scalps can not be absolutely proved. But Americans generally believed him guilty of this crime, and he was, while a prisoner, accused of it by the Council of Vir- ginia.” That scalps were paid for seems well established through the testimony of spies, disguised as traders, who visited Detroit and of American prisoners.” Among the goods listed at Detroit, which included blankets, kettles, knives, razors and rum, were one hundred and fifty dozen scalping knives." Hamilton's own dispatches indicate that the taking of scalps was by no means cxceptional. January, 1778, he wrote General Carleton *Thwaites and Kellogg, Rev. on Upper Ohio, 249 et seq. *See post, 337. *Morgan, Letter Book, III., March 20, 1778. Daniel Sullivan, in a letter to Colonel John Cannon, wrote of a visit to Detroit for the purpose of ascertaining the condition of that post. While there, he learned that Hamilton in his determination to destroy the frontier settlements was wont to pay “very high Prices. In Goods for the Scalps the Indians brought in.

Lieutenant-Governor Abbot in his appeal to General Carleton (June 8, 1778) to pre- vent the continuance of savage barbarities declared that “it is not people in arms that Indians will ever daringly attack, but the poor inoffensive families who fly to the deserts to be out of trouble, and who are in- humanly butchered sparing neither women or chil- dren.” Captain Bird, one of the noted leaders of the British and Indians, offered the Wyandot four hun- dred dollars if they would spare the life of a certain prisoner.

Lord Chatham opposed the enlistment of Indians. “But who is the man,” he said (November, 1777), “who has dared to authorize and associate to our arms the tomahawk and scalping- knife of the savage? . . . . What! to attribute the sanction of God and Nature to the massacres of the Indian scalping-knife. . . . . They shock every sentiment of honor. They shock me as a lover of honorable war and a detester of murderous barbarity. These abominable principles, and this more abom- inable avowal of them, demand a most decisive indignation.” Much time was consumed at Pittsburgh in the dis- cussion on the character of aggressive operations to be undertaken. It was counseled that an expedition to Detroit was the only remedy against the incursions of Indians. Others held this plan to be impracticable and unnecessary. No more telling reasons for an attack on Detroit and the probability of its success were formulated during the entire war, than those submitted by Colonel Morgan. He urged:* First, that theroad was practicable; second, that the Delawares and Shawnee were disposed to remain quiet; third, that there were no powerful tribes near or on the road to Detroit to oppose such an expedition; fourth, that Detroit was at the time in a defenseless state; fifth, that it was from that post that the offending western *This speech, in Parliament, was made in reply to Lord Suffolk who had declared that “there were no means which God and Nature might have placed at the disposal of the governing powers, to which they would not be justified in having recourse.” I *Morgan to Colonel Daniel Brodhead, July 17, 1778, Morgan, Letter Book, II.

For the purpose, he advised from twelve to fifteen hundred regular troops and such volunteers as might be secured. He opposed continuously all plans looking towards retaliatory expeditions which were then instituted by Congress. Finding that his advice was unheeded, and confident that the policy then adhered to would pro- duce a general Indian war, Colonel Morgan resigned his office as Indian agent. III. DEFENSE OF THE FRONTIER Meantime, preparations against a possible attack on the Virginia frontier settlements in the early spring of 1777 were hastened by order of Governor Patrick Henry. County-lieutenants were warned to have the militia in readiness.” Magazines were directed to be erected in Ohio, Yohogania and Monongalia counties, and ammunition was forwarded. With the coming of spring, two hundred warriors entered Kentucky with the design of cutting off the settlers gathered in the forts at Harrodsburg, Boonesborough, and at Logan's Station. Such a stroke, it was hoped by Hamilton, would put an end to American control in Kentucky. The fury of the attack upon each in turn "It was his belief that there were only some three hundred hostile Indians in the Western Department. Schoolcraft estimated that of the 7,280 Indians capable of bearing arms, only 380 were in the employ of the British.

DEFENSE OF THE FRONTIER xli was met with such desperate resistance that the savages withdrew from Harrodsburg and Boones- borough. The timely arrival of Colonel John Bow- man with two companies of a hundred men from Virginia, saved the besieged inhabitants at Logan's Fort from death by starvation or final surrender. The situation for the Kentucky people was still desperate during the succeeding winter. For twelve months they had scarcely ventured to go beyond the protection of the three forts. The greater part of their stock of corn had been burned. Their horses had been driven off and the two hundred women and children, many of them destitute of necessary clothing, could not be sent to the older settlements." Before the expiration of the time of enlistment of Bowman's men, the fields were cultivated and stocks of provisions and of ammunition were collected. Large numbers of emigrants entered Kentucky and the feeling of security increased. During April and May, small bands of Indians caused the utmost consternation on the Ohio frontier by com- mitting a number of murders. Forts and blockhouses were hastily constructed in some localities, while in others the inhabitants sought safety by flight.” It was learned at Fort Henry through Cornstalk, noted chief of the Shawnee, that a general confederacy of the northwestern tribes was well nigh complete, lacking only the addition of his tribe, and that hostilities were about to begin. *The men numbered sixty-five at Harrodsburg; twenty-two at Boones- borough, and fifteen at Logan's Fort.

xlii ILLINOIS HISTORICAL COLLECTIONS Informed of these hostile demonstrations, Congress resolved to send an experienced officer to take command at Fort Pitt, who was to embody the militia and plan for the general defense. This difficult undertaking was intrusted to Brigadier-General Edward Hand, who proceeded at once to Pittsburgh, arriving there June 1. To assist him on this mission, Congress voted arms and ammunition for the use of troops at Pittsburgh and elsewhere on the frontier, and four thousand dollars for strengthening the works at that post and for con- tingent expenses. Discretionary power was granted him to embody one thousand or more militia for the defense of the frontier. It was anticipated that the high opinion in which General Hand was held on the frontier would cause the militia when summoned to respond at once. Five companies assembled at Point Pleasant with the object of invading the Indian country, and there awaited General Hand's coming from Fort Pitt.” Upon his arrival with but few troops and without provisions the expedition was reluctantly abandoned and the militia returned to their homes. Messengers were then sent to the various isolated settlements recommending that they should be immediately abandoned and the settlers take shelter within the fortresses or retire east of the *Journal Cont.

Thirty bateaux, forty feet long, nine feet wide, and thirty inches deep were built by them for the purpose of transporting troops and provisions in case an invasion of the Indian country was determined upon. *While awaiting the coming of General Hand, some mutinous soldiers mur- dered Chief Cornstalk, who had been held as a hostage, together with his son and two companions. Rewards were offered by the governor and council of Virginia for the apprehension and conviction of the murderers, but without avail, owing to the excited state of public feeling. The Shawnee were there- after the inveterate foes of the whites and as a result the Indian war was renewed with greater vigor the following year. Draper MSS., 13S102, 144.

DEFENSE OF THE FRONTIER xiiii mountains. Notwithstanding the vigilance of scouting parties, constantly traversing the woods, deeds of savage violence were continuous. General Hand learned, through messages brought by runners from the Moravian towns, that the Ohio settlements were soon to be attacked by an army of Indians under the leadership of Simon Girty. Set- tlers hastened to retire to the security of the forts. The first blow fell on Fort Henry, garrisoned at the time by two companies of militia, forty men in all, under Colonel David Shepherd. Warned by General Hand of the approaching danger, Colonel Shepherd had early in August assembled the militia for the defense of the fort, but as the enemy did not appear vigilance was relaxed and nine companies of militia returned to their homes. This fort, which stood upon the bank of the Ohio near the mouth of Wheeling Creek, was next in importance to Fort Pitt.” Between the fort and the base of a steep hill was an open level space partly occupied by log cabins. The settlers were assured by scouts who had been watching the approaches that there was no immediate danger. During the night of August 31 between two and three hundred warriors ambushed themselves within a short distance of the village. Early next morning Andrew Zane and three companions, while searching for some horses were sur- prised by six Indians and one of the whites was killed. The others escaped, Zane, it is said, having leaped from *Moravians from the Muskingum. Girty was not the leader of this expedition. .*Fort Henry, formerly called Fort Fincastle, was built in 1774. It was an ºblong stockade of pickets pointed at the top and with bastions and sentry- ºoxes at the angles. About half an acre of ground was enclosed. Within the enclosure were log barracks, a storehouse, a well and cabins.

Discovering the main body of the Indians, they attempted to escape, but were all killed with the exception of two who were badly wounded but finally reached the fort. Another party of twelve advancing to the relief of their comrades, were in like manner shot down or butchered, one only escaping. The defense of the terror-stricken settlers, who mean- time had fled for refuge to the fort, was dependent on thirty-three men. To their surprise, the Indians did not make an attack. After throwing up rude earth- works, they killed all of the live stock within their reach, set fire to the cabins and retreated across the Ohio.1 On September 26, a scouting party consisting of forty-three men set out from Fort Henry. Returning the next day, they were attacked by Half King, chief of the Wyandot, who with forty of his braves were lying in ambush. Twenty-one of the whites were killed. Contrary to their usage, the savages continued their depredations after the setting in of winter, when the borderers were off their guard. Fearful lest these forays carried on at the instigation of British agents would lead to the depopulation of the Virginia and Pennsylvania frontiers, Congress late in the year, appointed three commissioners who were to co-operate with General Hand in carrying the *Many stories of the heroism of both men and women have been related in connection with this event.

They were empowered to extend such operations so as to include an immediate advance on Detroit and its dependencies, provided it was thought feasible at that season of the year and could be accomplished with a force not to exceed two thousand men, exclusive of Indian auxiliaries. Throughout the winter, preparations were carried on for protection against the recurrence of the outrages of the preceding year. New forts were built and old ones strengthened. General Hand now determined upon an aggressive policy. During February, 1778, with a force of five hundred men, chiefly militia, he set out for the Indian strongholds beyond the Ohio. Because of the heavy rains, the advance was slow. After taking possession of some Indian towns almost deserted by their inhabitants, the expedition was abandoned. This, the first movement by Americans against the Indians during the Revolution was deemed a failure. It resulted only in the capture of a number of non-combatants and was commonly known as “the squaw campaign.” Disappointed at the outcome, which was not due to lack of ability on his part, and “much pestered with the machinations” of the Tories who were numerous on the frontier, General Hand requested to be recalled from the command at Pittsburgh. He was succeeded by Lachlan Mc- Intosh who had entered the army at the opening of the war and had been advanced to the rank of brigadier- general. *November 20, 1777.

xlvi ILLINOIS HISTORICAL COLLECTIONS The incursions of the savages, assisted by the Tories, upon the frontiers of New York, Pennsylvania and Virginia were almost continuous during the spring and summer of 1778. While these attacks were incited by the authorities at Detroit many of the settlers themselves were not without blame. The borderers were characterized in a report of the Board of War as “a wild, ungovernable race, little less savage than their tawny neighbours; and by similar barbarities have in fact provoked them to revenge.” But the suffering of the innocent with the guilty made immediate relief necessary. It appeared certain, moreover, that these forays were but the preliminaries to a general Indian war which threatened with devastation the whole frontier region.” It was reported that sixteen hundred warriors from the Seneca, Cayuga, Onondaga, Mingo, Wyandot, and a few of the Ottawa, Chippewa and Shawnee tribes, together with a number of British emissaries, were collecting for this purpose.” All attempts to conciliate these tribes and the threaten- ings of the commissioners no longer availed, for the Indians were firm in the opinion, which had been assiduously inculcated among them, that the forbear- ance of the states proceeded from their inability to revenge the outrages committed against them.

One of them was to have as its object the capture of Detroit and the subjugation of such Indian tribes on the way thither as were enemies of the states. The other expedition was to be organized for the purpose of carrying the war into the Seneca country and the conquest of such tribes of the Six Nations as were hostile. Another object of this expedition was to gain possession of Oswego. The expedition against Detroit was projected on so large a scale that its success seemed assured. An army of three thousand men, the majority of them to be furnished by Virginia, was to advance in two equal divisions; one by the way of the Big Kanawha to Fort Randolph, where it was to be joined by the other division coming from Fort Pitt down the Ohio. Nine hundred and thirty thousand dollars were appropriated towards defraying the expenses.” That the French at Detroit would render no assist- ance to the English upon the approach of the enemy seemed certain.” Hamilton himself had knowledge of "Journals Cont. Cong., XI., 588. *Ibid., 590. This meant an expenditure of two hundred and sixty-one thousand dollars more than would be required for the maintenance of the defensive policy. Should Detroit be captured, however, it was shown that an amount larger than this additional sum would be saved in a single year, for the defense of the Virginia and Pennsylvania frontiers would no longer be necessary. *Letter of John Leath to George Morgan, August 19, 1778, in Morgan, Letter Book, III.

Commissioners sent by Congress assembled at Pittsburgh, and through the judicious distribution of presents among the Delawares, ten thousand dollars having been appropriated for that purpose, obtained permission to traverse their territory. In the mean- time, Congress determined to defer the expedition against Detroit. This change of plan was due chiefly to the report that it was impracticable to secure the necessary men, horses, flour and cattle within the time stipulated.” General McIntosh was directed to assemble fifteen hundred troops at Fort Pitt with which he was to proceed against the hostile tribes and destroy their towns. As a step in fulfillment of this plan, he built a fort (Fort McIntosh) at the mouth of Big Beaver Creek, *Mich. Pioneer and Hist. Coll., Ix., 432. *Resolutions of Congress, July 25, 1778.

This was the first fort built on the right bank of the Ohio, and although primarily intended as a refuge in case of defeat, it was well located to furnish assistance to the settlements which had reached the Muskingum and extended a few miles up that river. With a force of one thousand men, General McIntosh, towards the last of October, advanced westward. Reaching an elevated plain on the Tuscarawas River," seventy miles from Fort McIntosh, and while waiting for his main supplies to come up, he began the erection of a stockaded fort.” The construction of Fort Laurens completed, the season was then so far advanced, the time of enlistment of some of the soldiers had expired, and the difficulty of procuring provisions was so great" that the forward movement was abandoned. Leaving Colonel Gibson in charge with a garrison of one hundred and fifty men, McIntosh conducted his remaining force to Fort Pitt, where the militia were disbanded. During the course of these events a plan was evolved, which, like many another paper proposal, met with almost unanimous support in Congress. This included the capture of Detroit and Niagara and also an attack on Quebec, in which American troops were to be sup- ported by a French fleet and army under General La Fayette.

Late in January, a party of fifteen men which had carried provisions to them was waylaid, three miles from the fort, while returning to Fort Pitt, by a band of Mingo and Wyandot led by Simon Girty.” Other convoys of provisions failed to reach the fort because of attacks by Indians and the garrison was on the verge of starvation. In February, Captain Henry Bird of the King's regiment, accompanied by Simon Girty and a few soldiers, led one hundred and twenty savages against the fort itself. Colonel Gibson, aware of the presence of the enemy although they were in hiding, persisted in sending out eighteen men "October 22, 1778, Journals Cont. Cong., xii., 1042 et seq. 1.

For the protection of the frontiers of Pennsylvania and New Jersey, five hundred men were to be stationed near Wyoming, and this number was to be increased by one thousand in the spring. 3.

Washington regarded the whole plan as visionary, requiring as it would more troops and money than were available. He argued that the American government would in attempting its fulfillment become involved in engage- ments to France which could not be met.

For a month the fort was invested, the be- siegers finally retiring for want of supplies. A few days later General McIntosh reached the fort with five hundred regulars and militia. He learned of the criti- cal situation through an Indian who succeeded in stealing through the lines with a message from Colo- nel Gibson. The relief was timely, for the garrison had subsisted chiefly on roots for nearly a week. On his return to Fort Pitt, General McIntosh learned that his request to be relieved from the command of the western army had been granted and that Colonel Daniel Brodhead, a man well acquainted with the con- ditions in the back country, had, on the recommenda- tion of Washington, been appointed as his successor." While little had seemingly been accomplished by these movements, nevertheless the British plans to gain possession of the West and lend assistance to their eastern forces had been foiled. The rumor that another expedition was to be sent from Pittsburgh in April not only frightened the officials at Detroit, but “greatly damped the spirits” of their Indian allies.” They were soon forced to turn their attention to the more aggres- sive operations of George Rogers Clark, with whose coming a new phase of the war in the West was inaugurated. * * Draper M.S.S., 1H33.

lii ILLINOIS HISTORICAL COLLECTIONS IV. GEORGE ROGERS CLARK At this time, Clark was twenty-six years of age and was well prepared to assume the leadership of a frontier expedition. He was full six feet in height, well proportioned and noted for his great courage. After a few months schooling he had been taught surveying by his uncle and turned his attention to the Ohio Valley where locations of land were being made. On June 9, 1772, together with a few other adventurers he set out from Fort Pitt in a canoe on an exploring expedition down the Ohio. They reached the mouth of the Kanawha and spent a month in the exploration of the lands on the Ohio and its upper tributaries. Clark then returned for a short time to his home in Caroline County, but having determined to locate permanently in the West, he returned to the Ohio region. His glowing descriptions of the new country induced his father and a number of friends to accom- pany him. They remained only for a short time, however, and Clark, with a single companion, having gone down the river some three hundred miles below Pittsburgh, returned to take possession of land which he had selected on Fish Creek, one hundred and thirty miles below Fort Pitt.” After building their log-cabin, they spent the fall and winter in girdling trees and burning brushwood in preparation for the cultivation of the land. At the time, settlers were coming in large numbers to the region and Clark gave consider- able attention to surveying their lands.

GEORGE ROGERS CLARK hiii had reached the mouth of the Scioto, and in April Clark set out with a company of adventurers from Virginia to go to that region and carry on the exploration of the Kentucky country. He accompanied them only a portion of the distance and then returned for a brief visit at his old home. In September he was again at the Fish Creek settlement in time to harvest his crop of corn. In the early spring, Clark with some ninety other men, as prearranged, collected at the mouth of the Kanawha in order to descend the Ohio to settle Ken- tucky. Since, however, there was general alarm over the threatened hostilities of the Shawnee, and some depre- dations had already been committed, Clark with his asso- ciates, selected Michael Cresap as leader and ascended the river to Wheeling. He took an active part in the events which followed, accompanied Captain Cresap on his expedition against the Shawnee and served in the right wing of Governor Dunmore's army. On that expedition were Joseph Bowman, Leonard Helm and William Harrod, men who were to render notable service in the conquest of the Northwest. At the close of Dunmore's War the movement of population to Kentucky went on rapidly, and Clark early in the spring set out for the Kentucky River. He engaged in surveying lands in the interests of the Ohio Company, located land on his own account, visited Harrodsburg and the other stations and assisted in 1aying out a town.” So pleased was he with the beauty and richness of the country that he determined to make his home there. *Thwaites and Kellogg, Dunmore's War, 155, n. *Leestown was seventy miles up the Kentucky, about a mile distant from ºne site of Frankfort.

Return- ing to Kentucky, Clark visited the settlements and camps, thus becoming acquainted with the problems of the people, and by his attractive personality and enterprising spirit gained their confidence and friend- ship. He planned in a meeting of the people which he called at Harrodsburg, June 6, 1776, to have agents appointed who should treat with the Virginia assembly, and advocated the establishment of an independent state in case they failed to secure concessions. When Clark reached Harrodsburg on the day appointed for the assembly, he found that two delegates, another besides himself, had been selected to attend the assem- bly of Virginia and present a petition asking for recognition as a separate county, setting forth their distressed and defenseless situation and urging that efforts should be made to send them relief and protec- tion.” Within a few days they set out for Virginia. Their journey over the wilderness road was full of hardship owing to the heavy rains and their suffering from cold and hunger. They were in constant fear of attack by the Indians.” Before Clark reached Williamsburg," he learned that the legislature had adjourned, but he pushed on and, after an interview with Governor Patrick Henry, "It was a part of Fincastle County. *Journal Va.

GEORGE ROGERS CLARK lv presented his petition to the Council, at the same time asking for five hundred pounds of powder then sorely needed for the defense of Kentucky. The Council stood ready to make a loan of the ammunition, provi- ding Clark would himself become responsible. But this offer he promptly rejected, saying that “if a Cuntrey was not worth protecting it was not worth Claiming." Fearful lest the Kentuckians should seek protection elsewhere, as intimated by Clark, the Council finally acquiesced. The petition which he presented to the assembly, notwithstanding the opposition of Henderson and other leaders, was likewise agreed to, and early in December the new county of Kentucky was established." Clark then set out for Kentucky, going by the way of Pittsburgh in order to get the powder which had not yet been forwarded. With eight other men he began the descent of the river in a single boat. Narrowly escaping capture by Indian scouting parties, they landed at the mouth of Limestone Creek, hid the powder and proceeded to Harrodsburg in order to get a guard strong enough to bring on the supplies in safety. Clark and two companions hurried forward, leaving the other members of the party at the Licking. Shortly afterwards, a small force under Colonel John Todd arrived and it was determined that he should go with ten men and bring on the ammunition. They were attacked by Indians and three of the party were killed.” Early in January, the powder and other stores were *Fincastle County was by this act divided into three counties, Kentucky, Washington and Montgomery.

At the time, Clark's presence and services were in- dispensable. During the spring the government for Kentucky County went into effect. Harrodsburg was made the county seat. In addition to the county- lieutenant, colonel, and lieutenant-colonel, commissions were likewise issued by the governor of Virginia to justices of the peace who were to constitute the county court.” The court was to meet once a month and had associated with it a sheriff and a clerk. Two delegates were chosen to represent the county in the House of Burgesses.” The immediate need was military protec- tion, and to Clark was entrusted the organization of the militia at Harrodsburg." Every man, whether a per- manent resident or not, was expected to report in turn for his share of service in one of the companies. During the summer there was a succession of skirmishes with the Indians. Many venturing to leave the confines of the posts were killed or captured and no corn was raised at Harrodsburg that year.

EXPEDITION AGAINST ILLINOIS lvii expeditions, Clark led the militia. While many of the people were advocating the abandonment of Ken- tucky, he quieted their fears by assurance of assistance from Virginia. V. ExPEDITION AGAINST ILLINOIS At the same time his mind was occupied with the problem of conquering the region north of the Ohio. He was well aware that as long as the British held control in the French villages of the Illinois, they would be rallying points for the Indian war-parties sent against the Kentucky posts. He saw that the surest defense against their forays would be to capture these posts and win the friendship of the French. As a first step, therefore, in April he sent Benjamin Linn and Samuel Moore as spies to Kaskaskia and Vincennes. What his designs were was a secret which he shared with no one. Disguised as hunters, these young men Succeeded in their mission and at the end of two months returned to Harrodsburg. They reported that there was no suspicion of an attack from Kentucky, that the fort at Kaskaskia was unguarded; and that while the French feared the American backwoodsmen, whom they regarded as desperadoes, they were not strongly attached to the British." Clark advocated sending a force to capture Kaskaskia, for, he declared “[we must] either take the town of Kuskuskies, or in less than a twelve month send an army against the Indians on Wabash, which will cost ten times as much, and not be of half the service.” He was aware that if all the men in the Kentucky settlements were enlisted the capture Clark to Patrick Henry, post, 32.

lviii ILLINOIS HISTORICAL COLLECTIONS of these posts would not be possible unless re-enforce- ments should be secured. On October 1, therefore, he started for Virginia to lay his plans before Governor Henry." He joined a company composed of seventy- six men and a number of women and children who, fearing further Indian outrages, were returning to their old homes. Progress along the wilderness road was still further delayed on account of the cattle which they drove along with them to be used for food. From fourteen to twenty miles constituted a day's journey. On the nineteenth day, having reached the region where it would be possible to spend a night at some settler's cabin or frontier town, Clark rode on alone and finally, on November 1, reached his father's house, having traveled six hundred and twenty miles.” After a visit of one day he pushed on to Williams- burg, where he found the people still greatly excited over the news of Burgoyne's surrender. For two weeks he was forced to wait for an agreement by the state auditors to accept his accounts and those of the Ken- tucky militia. During that time, he mentions buying a ticket in the state lottery for three pounds and his attendance at church on Sunday.” On December 10, Clark presented his views to Governor Henry and at once won his favor. But the Governor hesitated to order an expedition into that un- known country. To lay the plans before the assembly would deprive them of all secrecy and thus defeat their purpose.

EXPEDITION AGAINST ILLINOIS lix that it be carried out, and promised to use their in- fluence in securing three hundred acres of conquered land from the assembly for each man enlisting in the expedition, providing it should prove successful. On January 2, final action was secured in the Council which made the expedition possible. The assent of the assembly had been gained through the general plea that it was designed as a defense for Kentucky." Clark was made lieutenant-colonel and was author- ized to raise anywhere in Virginia seven companies of militia, each containing fifty men.” He was advanced twelve hundred pounds in depreciated currency and was given an order on the commanding officer at Fort Pitt for the necessary boats, ammunition and supplies. By strict interpretation of his open letter of instructions, Clark was to go to the defense of Kentucky. But in his private instructions, he was directed to capture Kaskaskia. With no one, evidently, did he share his secret thought that after the conquest of the Illinois country he would march against Detroit.” Elated over the thought that it would soon be within his power to put an end to attacks by the Indians, Clark hastened to the frontier. From the beginning, his recruiting officers encountered difficulties in enlist- ing men. Virginians and Pennsylvanians were still contending for the control of the territory about Pitts- burgh and many leading men were opposed to making the sacrifice necessary to hold possession of Kentucky. “I found my case desperate,” Clark wrote. But no obstacle moved him from carrying out his designs. ‘Hening, Statutes at Large, IX., 375. 'Patrick Henry'sletter of instruction to Clark, January 2, 1778, post, 34. *Mason Letter, post, 116.

1x ILLINOIS HISTORICAL COLLECTIONS Finally on May 12, with his one hundred and fifty frontiersmen who had agreed to accompany him on the expedition, together with a number of private adven- turers and settlers with their families, he set out from Redstone. After taking on stores at Pittsburgh and Wheeling, they proceeded cautiously down the Ohio, not knowing when they might be surprised by Indian war parties. Reaching the Falls of the Ohio, Clark was, as he said, “made desperate" upon learning that instead of the four companies of men expected from the Holston, only part of a company would be available, and that but a small force of Kentuckians had arrived. But he did not despair and worked more steadfastly to over- come this disappointment. Throughout the Revolution, Clark regarded the falls of the Ohio as his chief center of operations. This spot, when fortified, gave him control of the river traffic, for boats could not there be taken up or down the river until they were first unloaded. Besides, while affording protection to expeditions from the Kentucky settlements to the Illinois country, it served to hold in check the Indian tribes. At first he took possession of an island in the center of the falls in order the more easily to prevent desertions. Then, for the first time he disclosed to his men the real object of the expedition. The proposal was enthusiastically received by officers and men. A few of the Holston men mani- fested fear at being taken so far into the enemy's country and escaped to the mainland during the night. They were pursued by horsemen but only seven or eight of the deserters were captured. Mason Letter, post, 117.

EXPEDITION AGAINST ILLINOIS lxi Meantime, a small portion of land had been appor- tioned to each of the twenty families which had accom- panied Clark. They were to remain on the island in order to cultivate their crop of corn and defend the block-house where the provisions were stored. Clark was the more eager to go forward after he learned of the French alliance, for he counted on its effect over the Illinois people. On June 24, after a day of rejoicing, Clark set off with his little army of one hundred and seventy-five men. They shot the falls during a total eclipse of the sun, an omen which was variously interpreted by his men. The four companies were made up of picked men, for all had been rejected who were thought unable to stand the necessary hard- ships. With oars double-manned, they descended the Ohio River to the mouth of the Tennessee, where final preparations were made for the overland march to Kaskaskia. Had the ordinary route down the Ohio to its mouth and up the Mississippi been selected, they could not have escaped being discovered by scouts of the enemy. A boat descending the river containing a party of American hunters was captured. As they had but recently come from Kaskaskia, Clark was able to gather from them the information he sought. More- over, upon their request, they were granted permission to accompany the expedition and serve as guides. Dropping down the river ten miles to Fort Massac, an abandoned French stronghold where the boats were secreted, the expedition struck off through the wilderness towards the northwest. Each man carried only such "Letter of Joseph Bowman, July 30, 1778, in English, Conquest of the North- rest, 1., 559.

They marched single file in order to make as little show of tracks as possible and thus excite no suspicions in those who might cross the trail. For the first fifty miles they pushed through the woods with great effort. On the third day, having reached the stretches of level plains, John Sanders, who was serving as chief guide, lost his way, and at Once there was the greatest confusion. Clark, fearful lest they should be discovered by spies or attacked by Indians, suspected the guide of treachery and threat- ened, with great anger, to put him to death unless he found his way that evening. Within two hours he succeeded in getting his bearings again and the march was resumed. On the evening of the fourth of July they came to the Kaskaskia River three miles above the town. Six days had been consumed in the march of one hundred and twenty miles. Their meager store of provisions was exhausted at the end of the fourth day. Two days of hunger and fatigue did not, however, deprive them of the resolution to succeed at whatever cost. As darkness approached, they moved silently down the river to a farm-house. The family were made prisoners and from them Clark learned that Roche- blave, who was then in command at the British fort, hearing rumors of a possible attack, had summoned the men to arms, but that his spies having returned without discovering any trace of an enemy, the people were again off their guard.” Boats were procured, and within two hours Clark and *Chicago Hist.

EXPEDITION AGAINST ILLINOIS ixiii his men had crossed the Kaskaskia River. So silently did they move that no alarm was given. One division of the troops surrounded the town while Clark with the other division pushed on to the fort gate which was found to be open. Following their guide, they advanced to the governor's house." Rocheblave, completely sur- prised, was found in an upper room and captured. The loud huzzas which followed were answered by shouts from the other division, scattered in small squads in different parts of the town. Not a shot had been fired and within fifteen minutes every street was secured. Runners were sent through the town ordering the people, on pain of death, to keep close to their houses, and by daylight all were disarmed. The villagers were in greatest confusion for they had been told of the savage nature of the Americans. “Giving all for lost,” wrote Clark, “their Lives were all they could dare beg for, which they did with the greatest fervancy; they were willing to be Slaves to save their Families.” But instead of employing extreme meas- ures, Clark was desirous of gaining their allegiance for he was well aware that with his small force it would be impossible to hold in subjection a town having a population of one thousand, together with their numer- ous Indian allies. Besides he hoped for their assistance in carrying out the remainder of his plan. To a depu- tation of the leading men, therefore, he explained the causes for the war, saying that although by the laws of war they were completely at his mercy, yet it was an American principle to free and not enslave those whom ‘John Sanders was the hunter who piloted them.

Com- plete liberty was extended to any who desired to take their families out of the country. This promise of liberty, together with the news of the French alliance and the influence of American traders who resided among them, won the adherence of the French, but Clark's generous conduct towards their church served still more to excite their enthusiasm for the American cause. To Father Pierre Gibault, who asked permis- sion to conduct the usual services in the village church, Clark replied that he had nothing to do with churches except to protect them from insult, and that the Catho- lic church, under the laws of Virginia, would be granted as many privileges as any other.” The effect was expressed by Clark as follows: “In a few Minutes the scean of mourning and distress was turned to an excess of Joy, nothing else seen nor heard—Addorning the Streets with flowers & Pavilians of different colours, compleating their happiness by singing &c.” In the same spirit, all took the oath of loyalty to the United States.” Meantime, Joseph Bowman led thirty mounted men against the other Illinois towns. Prairie du Rocher, St. Philippe and Cahokia were each surprised in turn and the people promptly took the oath of allegiance.* *Mason Letter, post, 121. *Ibid. *Ibid. “Because of the insulting conduct of Rocheblave, he was sent as a prisoner to Virginia.

FINANCES AND INDIAN AFFAIRS lxv At the same time, Father Gibault undertook to gain the support of the French at Vincennes for the Ameri- can cause. Together with Dr. Laffont and a few others, he went on horseback to Vincennes. The mission was completely successful and on the first of August they returned with the news that the Ameri- can flag was floating over that post. Captain Leonard Helm was then sent to take command of the French militia at Vincennes. VI. FINANCES AND INDIAN AFFAIRS But would Clark be able to hold possession of the region he had conquered. His position was a perilous one. The time for which his troops were enlisted had expired and the most of them were anxious to return to their homes. Without re-enforcements, and he had no promise of any, he could scarcely hope to deal suc- cessfully with the thousands of savages who were allies of the British, much less would he be able to capture Detroit, the key to British authority in the West. At no time in his career did he display greater talents and energy. By rare tact, he gained the good will of the two factions which existed among the French- men at Kaskaskia, and their leading men contributed to the support of his followers.” Without money, Clark began to issue bills of credit on Virginia in exchange for provisions. These proved satisfactory to the merchants and traders for they were received and paid at their face value in silver by Oliver See Alvord, Cahokia Records (I. H.

Scarcely had the Revolution opened when Pollock began his zealous endeavors, as agent of the state, to secure assistance from the Spanish authorities for the American cause. During the summer of 1776 he obtained ten thousand pounds of powder from Governor Unzaga, and the greater part of it was deliv- ered by Lieutenant William Linn at Wheeling at a time when that post and Fort Pitt needed it greatly for pro- tection and to further their dealings with the Indians." By the end of the year 1777, Governor Galvez, largely through Pollock's influence, had aided the Americans by sending arms, ammunition, and provisions to the frontiers of Pennsylvania and Virginia amounting to seventy thousand dollars.” On July 18, 1778, Clark wrote Pollock: “I have suc- ceeded agreeable to my wishes. & am Necessiated to draw Bills on the State and have reason to believe they will be accepted by you the answering of which will be acknowledged, by his Excely the Governor of Virginia.” Large bateaux, rowed with twenty-four oars, loaded with goods sent by Pollock under protection of the Spanish flag, slipped past Natchez then under the con- trol of the British, and in eighty-five or ninety days arrived at St. Louis or the Illinois posts." Full credit was given by Clark to Pollock for his assistance by which he was enabled to hold the Illinois country. “The invoice Mr. Pollock rendered upon all occasions in paying those bills;” Clark declared, “I considered See Thwaites and Kellogg, Rev. on Upper Ohio, xv., 226 et seq. *See James, “The Significance of the Attack on St. Louis, 1780," in Miss.

The following January, five hundred pounds of powder and some swivels were received by Clark from the same source. By February 5 of that year, bills were drawn on Pollock by Clark amount- ing to forty-eight thousand dollars. In paying ten thousand dollars of this amount, Pollock had been forced to dispose of his remaining slaves at a great disadvantage.” Friendly relations between Clark and De Leyba, the Spanish lieutenant-governor at St. Louis, were begun immediately after the capture of Kaskaskia and became constantly more intimate, through correspondence, through the influence of Colonel François Vigo, trusted associate of Clark and friend and business partner of De Leyba, and through the visits of Clark at the home of the latter in St. Louis. “This gentleman,” Clark wrote Governor Henry, September 16, 1778, “inter- ests himself much in favor of the States, more so than I could have expected. He has offered me all the force that he could raise, in case of an attack by Indians from Detroit, as there is now no danger from any other quarter.” By presents and promises, Clark induced one hun- dred of his troops to continue their enlistment for eight months. “To color my staying with so few troops,” " 'Certificatc signed by Clark, July 2, 1785.

He agreed to remain with his two companies but assured them that at any time he would be able to increase his force from the garrison at the falls. Clark then gave his attention to the pacification of the Indian tribes. Those in the vicinity of Kaskaskia offered to treat for peace at Once, but the task with which he was confronted at Cahokia was gigantic. Hundreds of savages were gathered at that town to hear what the Big Knives had to say. Some of them had come from a distance of five hundred miles. Among them were warriors from the Chippewa, Ot- tawa, Potawatomi, Sauk, Foxes, Miami and numerous other tribes between the Mississippi and the Great Lakes.” In all of the councils, Clark showed a com- plete understanding of Indian nature. While treating them with justice he adopted an attitude, as occasion demanded, either kind, conciliatory or severe. He seemed to be confident but was always on his guard and prepared for any emergency. He declared that it signified little to him whether they chose the peace- belt or the war-belt, and challenged them on behalf of his people to continue the war.

THE STRUGGLE FOR VINCENNES lxix Over-awed by his manner and influenced by the fact that the French and Spaniards were now friendly to the American cause, the chiefs, when summoned to the grand council where all of the Indian ceremonies were rigidly observed, agreed thenceforth to be at peace with the Americans. Returning to Kaskaskia, Clark took up the problem of establishing government for the towns under his control. By the close of October, courts, resembling the county courts of Virginia and having both criminal and civil jurisdiction, were estab- lished at Cahokia and Kaskaskia. By the enlistment of young French volunteers, his four companies of troops continued their original number of men and the drill to which he subjected them soon transformed them into a well-disciplined body of troops. VII. THE STRUGGLE FOR VINCENNES By August 6, Hamilton knew of Clark's success in the Illinois country.” While in expectation of a like report from Vincennes, he began preparing an expedi- tion to regain the captured posts. Agents were sent at once among the Wabash, Miami and Shawnee with liberal presents, to stir the Indians up against the Americans.

lxx ILLINOIS HISTORICAL COLLECTIONS British officials in the usual manner and told of the plans about to be executed. The commandants at Mackinac and St. Joseph were urged to co-operate through sending forces by way of the Illinois River. Hamilton was more confident of success because of conditions in the Illinois country, described by him as follows: “The Spaniards are feeble and hated by the French, the French are fickle and have no man of capacity to advise or lead them, the Rebels are enter- prizing & brave, but want resources, and the Indians can have their resources but from the English if we act without loss [of] time in the favourable conjuncture.” During the month of September, provisions, artillery stores and presents for the Indians were collected and forwarded in fifteen pirogues, each capable of carrying from eighteen hundred to three thousand pounds.” By October, some one hundred and seventy-five white troops, two-thirds of them French volunteers and militia, and sixty Indians were drawn up on the com- mon, the Catholics receiving a blessing at the hands of the aged Father Pothier, upon condition that they should strictly adhere to their oath of allegiance. Led by Hamilton himself, they started on their journey of six hundred miles, which was to consume seventy-one days.” Three objects, among others, it was hoped ultimately to accomplish by means of the expedition. These were: (1) To erect a fort at the junction of the Mississippi and the Ohio which was to constitute a “bridle” on American trade; (2) To get control of the mouth of the Missouri, with the hope of underselling "Mich.

Besides, such an expedition presented to Governor Hamilton relief from the burdens of his office. For three years he had been forced to administer affairs of government under most trying circumstances in a community made up of French, Indians, traders and British soldiers. To the Frenchmen, who grudgingly accepted British domi- nance, his orders were deemed most arbitrary and in- tolerable. While collecting supplies for his expedition, the presentment of a grand jury in Montreal was being prepared in which he was held responsible for the acts of one of his officials who at various times “trans- acted divers, unjust & illegal, Terranical & feloni- ous acts & things contrary to good Government and the safety of His Majesty's Liege subjects." The traverse of thirty-six miles on Lake Erie from the mouth of the Detroit River to the mouth of the Maumee was made with great difficulty. A gale during the night almost swamped the boats and forced the expedition to go ashore at a spot near the mouth of the Maumee. Because of the lowness of the water they proceeded slowly up this river until they reached *Mich. Pioneer and Hist. Coll., Ix., 477. *De Peyster to Haldimand, September 21, 1778.

Having crossed the por- tage of nine miles, they found the river so shallow that the boats could not have proceeded farther had the water not been deepened by a beaver dam four miles below the landing. A passage was cut in the dam and through this the boats passed. They were delayed by swamps and twice dams had to be built in order that the boats might be floated across. Meantime the winter had set in and the ice cut the men as they were forced to drag the boats over the rocks. At times the stores had to be carried around the shoals. After a number of conferences at Indian villages, they reached Ouiatanon where they received the allegiance of a number of Wabash chiefs who had previously declared for the Americans. When within a few days of Vin- cennes, they captured four men who had been sent out by Captain Helm as a reconnoitering party. Parties were ordered out to intercept any messengers who might be sent to the Illinois or the Falls of the Ohio. Thus two men carrying a note from Helm to Clark announcing the approach of the British were made prisoners. Hamilton and his force, which had been increased to the number of five hundred by accessions from the Indians, entered Vincennes on December 17.1 Because of the capture of his spies, Captain Helm was uncertain of the whereabouts of the enemy until they were within three miles of Vincennes. Panic seized the French inhabitants at the first sight of the British "Clark in his letter to Governor Henry, post, 97, says that Hamilton's force numbered six hundred.

The inhabitants, when summoned to the church, renewed their oath of allegiance and the militia seem- ingly manifested no reluctance in surrendering their American commissions. During the winter the gar- rison consisted of ninety whites, the Detroit militia having been sent home. Most of the Indians also returned to their villages. Had Hamilton pushed forward at once, it is probable he could likewise have regained control of the Illinois towns. But to him the obstacles seemed insurmount- able. His stock of provisions was not adequate, he thought, for a mid-winter march which would be de- layed by the flooded country. Scouting parties were sent out, one to the mouth of the Wabash to capture any boats on the Ohio, and others towards the Falls of the Ohio and Kaskaskia. Messages were forwarded to Stuart, Indian agent among the southern tribes, urging him to prepare these Indians for a combined attack. Hamilton was confident of the complete success of his plan in a spring campaign in which he was to be aided by troops from Pensacola.

Late in December, while in expectation of the news that this fort had been captured, he was informed that the expedition had been abandoned. At the same time he learned of the expedition which had set out under Hamilton, presumably against Kaskaskia. Within a few days Clark set out for Cahokia to confer with some of the leaders regarding their conduct should the surrender of that post, which seemed inevitable, take place. Three miles out from Kaskaskia he and his guard of six or seven men and a few “gentlemen in chairs” narrowly escaped being captured by a party of forty Ottawa under white leaders." Ten miles farther on they arrived at the village of La Prairie du Rocher where they expected to pass the night. While attending a ball given in their honor, a messenger arrived with the report that Hamilton and his entire force were within three miles of Kaskas- kia and preparing for an immediate attack. Clark's unconcern, as he ordered them to continue the dance until his horses were saddled, dissipated the general confusion in the company. When Clark and his com- panions reached Kaskaskia they found the people in great consternation over the attack which they were convinced was imminent. By morning the plan for defense was complete. Clark determined to burn that part of the town near the fort and prepare to withstand the attack. The villagers, confident of the success of the British, were at a loss how to act.

After he received the declaration of their allegiance, Clark more completely won their favor through his kindly consideration for all their wishes. Captain Bowman arrived the next day with re-enforce- ments from Cahokia. Their fears were lessened also when it was learned that “the great army” that gave the alarm consisted only of a small body of whites and Indians making their retreat as fast as possible to Vincennes. Clark now felt convinced that Hamilton was in possession of that post and that the attack on the Illinois posts was but a question of time. While uncertain how to proceed, the information brought by a Spanish trader, François Vigo, enabled him to decide at once on the course to be followed. Colonel Vigo who had favored the American cause from the time of the capture of Kaskaskia, was a partner of the governor of Upper Louisiana in Indian trade. He was at Vin- cennes when it was retaken by Hamilton and was held as a prisoner. When released he hurried to St. Louis, having agreed not to do anything injurious to the British interests on his way to that post. This agree- ment fulfilled, he proceeded to Kaskaskia and on January 29, gave Clark “every Intiligence that I could wish to have.” Clark's position was desperate when he resolved to risk all he had gained by at once taking the Offensive and attempting the reduction of Vincennes. “It was at this moment,” he declared, “I would have bound myself seven years a Slave to have had five hundred Troops.” The wish was vain, for not only had he *Mason Letter, post, 138.

lxxvi ILLINOIS HISTORICAL COLLECTIONS received no re-enforcements from Virginia, but for nearly a year he had not received, as he said, “a scrape of a pen” from Governor Henry." His confidence that the expedition would be success- ful seemed to inspire his men, and “in a day or two the Country seemed to believe it, many anctious to retrieve their Characters turned out, the Ladies began also to be spirited and interest themselves in the Expedition, which had great Effect on the Young men.” With this enthusiasm, provisions and stores were soon collected. On February 5, the Willing, an armed row-galley, the first armed boat on a western river, mounting two four-pounders and four swivels, with a crew of forty men commanded by Lieutenant John Rogers, set off under orders to take station a short distance below Vincennes and prevent any boat from descending the Wabash, for it was surmised that in case of defeat the British would attempt to escape by this route.” The following afternoon, Clark, with his one hundred and thirty men, nearly one-half of whom were French volunteers, Father Gibault having granted them absolution, marched out of Kaskaskia.” From the outset they encountered trials which be- came steadily more extreme as they dragged themselves over the one hundred and eighty miles to their goal."

At night, with no tents for shelter, they gathered around the great camp- fires and feasted on buffalo and other game, each com- pany taking turns in hunting and cooking. Singing, dancing and other diversions followed. February 13, they reached the first branch of the Little Wabash. Vincennes was then about twenty miles distant, but the intervening country was almost completely under water. The two branches of the river, although but a league apart, were now so flooded that they made a single stream five miles wide, with water three feet deep in the shallowest places. “This,” wrote Clark, “would have been enough to have stop'ed any set of men that was not in the same temper we was.” He ordered a canoe to be built to be used in ferrying men and stores across the main stream. A scaffold was built at the far side of the channel upon which to place the baggage until the pack horses should be brought over and again loaded. This done, they marched on to the second branch, which was crossed in the same way, and on the evening of the fifteenth, they came to a higher spot upon which they encamped “in high spirits.” Their real trials now began, for provisions were scarce and a11 the game had been driven off by the floods. On the evening of the seventeenth, they reached the Em- barrass River which was so high they could not cross. Later in the evening they found a spot from which the water had but recently receded, and there, hungry and shivering with the cold, they passed the remainder

lxxviii ILLINOIS HISTORICAL COLLECTIONS of the “drizzly and dark” night. The next morning they heard the morning gun at the fort, then only nine miles away. Still unable to ford the river, they marched down stream and early in the afternoon reached the Wabash. Here they remained during the two fol- lowing days. Three unsuccessful attempts were made to get men across to the vicinity of Vincennes to gather information and to steal boats.” Two men were dis- patched in a canoe with orders to Lieutenant Rogers to bring on the Willing as fast as possible. The hungry, dispirited men were set to building boats which might be used to cross the Wabash. For two days they had been without food and many of the French volunteers, in despair, talked of returning. Confident that his regular troops would not abandon the enterprise, Clark talked of the victory so soon to be gained, laughed at their fears, and by his confidence gave courage to all the faltering. About noon of the twentieth, five hunters going down the river were captured, from whom it was learned that their approach had not been discovercol and that the people of Vin- cennes sympathized with the American cause. The next night the troops were ferried to the eastern bank of the river and landed on a small hill. All thought *Clark refers to the assistance given by a drummer boy in cheering the men as they waded through the water. (Clark's Memoir, post, 27.1.). In the Draper MSS., 25S41, John Law gives the story, as told him by residents of Vincennes. It was said that on one occasion in the vicinity of the Embarrass the water became so deep that the men refused to go further. A drummer boy was placed on the shoulders of a tall sergeant, and the ludicrous specta- cle of the lad beating his drum in that position “so excited the laughter of the men that they readily fell in and waded along cheerfully.” The story is related also in Law, Vincennes, 32. There is no reference, in any of the records consulted, to insubordination among Clark's men.

THE STRUGGLE FOR VINCENNES lxxix of bringing the horses across was abandoned." Dis- regarding the warning of their French guides that Vincennes could not be reached they plunged ahead three miles, with the water at times up to their shoul- ders, and reached another hill. There they encamped and, notwithstanding their sufferings, took comfort, as Clark said:“from the hopes of their Fatiegue soon being at an end and their wishes accomplish in getting in contact with the Enemy.” On the morning of the 22d, the march was again resumed with shouts and favorite song, as ordered by Clark who was in the lead, the canoes bearing those who were unable to walk. Before reaching the deepest water one of the men found that he had struck a path and by following it with care along the higher ground, they finally reached a small area of ground covered with hard maples. This spot, which was comparatively dry, had been used as a sugar camp. They were now six miles from Vincennes. The prisoners declared that any attempt to ford the water of greatest depth between them and the town would be extremely dangerous and utterly futile. The gloom of their situation was well expressed in the striking words of Colonel Bowman: “No pro- visions yet, lord help us.” To add to their suffering the night was so cold that the water in quiet places was covered with ice one-half an inch in thickness. Shortly after sunrise on the clear morning of the twenty-third, Clark told his followers that within a few hours they might expect to see an end to their fatigue.

His half-frozen, famished followers, with a cheer, imitated the example of their leader. In crossing the Horse-shoe Plain, then a shallow lake four miles wide, they encountered their greatest trials; the hardships which they had undergone began to tell on the weakest and the canoes, by making several trips to an island about ten acres in extent, saved them from drowning. Clark encouraged his men at every step and the strong lent assistance to their weaker companions. They came to a stretch of woods, where the water was up to the shoulders of the tallest. Many were worn out but clung to the trees and floating logs until they were rescued by the canoes. Others as they gained the shore fell exhausted with their bodies partly in the water. Fires were built and broth was made from a half quarter of buffalo which was taken from some squaws who chanced to be passing in a canoe. Thus all were slightly refreshed and, cheered with warmth from the fires and the beauty of the day, they set out early in the afternoon with renewed courage. After crossing a deep, narrow lake in the canoes and marching a short distance, they reached a small hill of dry land covered with timber, known as Warrior's Island. Here their hearts were gladdened by a view of the fort and the town scarcely two miles distant- A number of horsemen were seen shooting ducks on the pools which lay in the hollows between them and the town. From one of these Frenchmen, who was taken prisoner, it was learned that their coming was in no way suspected. He informed them also that the

What was Clark to do at this critical time; for he was aware that the number of his troops was not one-fourth of the com- bined force of the enemy and their allies. If the attack were to be made without warning a number of lives would probably be lost among the villagers and the Indians and this would serve to embitter the others. Knowing that some of the French were lukewarm in their allegiance to the British, Clark determined to announce his approach to the inhabitants, believing that a bold stroke at the time would encourage his friends and so confuse his opponents that they would manifest little hostility at his appearance. According- ly he prepared a letter to the villagers, which was Carried to them by the prisoner who had been kept from knowſedge of the true numbers of the Americans. Clark declared that his army, then two miles from the town, was prepared to capture the fort without delay; that all friends of the American cause were to remain in their houses and the enemies, should there be any, repair to the fort, join the force of the “hair-buyer General and fight like men;” that any found under arms in the streets were to be treated as enemies. The people quickly gathered in the public square to hear this message. They were so surprised and appalled that none of them dared go to the fort to inform Hamilton. It was then about sunset and Clark having urged implicit obedience ordered the march to begin with colors flying and drums braced. By marching to and fro, a slight elevation obstructing the view so that only the flags could be seen from the

Darkness shut out their real numbers when, at eight o'clock, guided by their five prisoners, they reached the town in two divisions, one led by Clark and the second by Colonel Bowman. A few men were sent at once to fire on the fort. The surprise was so complete that Hamilton was not aware of the approach of the enemy, and believed the rifle shots to have been fired by drunken Indians, until one of his men was wounded by a shot fired through a port-hole.” Another party was sent to investigate the cause, but returned after the Americans were in possession of Vincennes. With drums beating, the main division of Clark's force marched up the village street, the people greeting them joyfully. Some of the leading Frenchmen had secreted supplies of ammunition, and these were now freely presented to Clark whose stock was well-nigh exhausted.” The British Indians fled at the approach of the Americans. A Piankashaw, son of the chief of that tribe, tendered Clark the services of one hundred warriors but the offer was declined. Fifty of the Americans were detailed as a guard while the others joined by a number of the Creoles stormed the fort. The firing was almost continuous through the night. The cannon and swivel were 1ocated eleven feet above the ground on the second floor of the blockhouses at each angle of the palisaded fort. Little damage was done by the cannon further *Mason Letter, post, 141. *See Hamilton's Report, post, 186. *Colonel Le Gras and Major Bosseron were mentioned. See Clark's Memoir. post, 281.

Two hundred yards in front of the gate, the Americans threw up an intrenchment but small squads of men, under cover of the houses and hastily constructed breast-works, advanced to within thirty yards of the walls. So accurate was the aim of the backwoodsmen and so con- stant their firing through the port-holes, that the cannon were silenced, a number of the gunners having been killed or wounded. At daylight a “very smart fire of small arms” was begun on the American works and one man was slightly wounded. About nine o'clock, Clark sent a messenger to Hamilton demanding the surrender of the fort. While awaiting the reply, his men took breakfast which was their first regular meal for six days. Hamilton answered that they were “not disposed to be awed into any action unworthy of British subjects.” The conflict was again resumed. At the end of two hours the firing ceased as Lieutenant Helm approached the American lines. He was instructed to say that the British were prepared to surrender under honorable terms. “Immediate surrender,” was Clark's reply and the acceptance of the proposal within thirty minutes, for it was with difficulty, he declared, that he restrained his men from storming the garrison. At the end of the time Lieutenant Helm returned bringing the proposal that there should be a three days' truce. This was likewise rejected by Clark who again insisted on the unconditional surrender of the garrison but stated his willingness to meet for a conference at the French church. At this time a band of Indians led by a *Clark's Journal, post, 165. Bowman's Journal, post, 161. *Clark's Journal, post, 166. Mason Letter, post, 143.

In place of the welcome usual at such times, they were met by an attacking party which killed two of them, took six prisoners' and wounded several that escaped. Clark seized this occasion to show the Indians that the British were powerless to lend them aid and ordered the prison- ers tomahawked within sight of the garrison. Their leader proved to be the son of one of Clark's volunteer lieutenants and owing to the entreaties of his father and other officers his life was spared. Hamilton, having agreed to a conference, proceeded to the little French church accompanied by Lieutenant Helm and Major Hay and was there met by Clark and Captain Bowman. Governor Hamilton strove to secure a modification of the ultimatum but Clark was obdurate. Towards evening the terms of surrender were signed according to which Fort Sackville, together with all stores, was to be delivered up and the garrison become prisoners of war.” At ten o'clock on the following morning the garrison of seventy-nine men marched out of the fort and were received at the gate by two companies of troops drawn up under Captain Bowman and Captain McCarty. At the head of his other troops, Clark marched into the fort, hoisted the American flag and gave the national salute of thirteen guns.” Clark was surprised to find that a fort so strong and 'Clark's Journal, post, 167, states that three were killed and four made prisoners. - *For full terms see Bowman's Journal, post, 162. 3 Ibid.

This achieve- ment marks the climax of one of the most heroic and notable achievements in history. The boldness of the plan, the skill with which it was executed, and the perseverance in overcoming obstacles seemingly in- surmountable excited the admiration of Hamilton him- self.” Courage born of desperation was manifested by men and leaders alike for all were fully conscious that failure would mean the loss not alone of the Illinois country but also of Kentucky.” The goods brought from Detroit by Hamilton, and those taken from British traders, were divided among Clark's followers, the officers receiving nothing except a few articles of clothing, the soldiers getting “almost Rich.” Besides the large quantities of military stores and Indian goods, the Americans were strengthened by coming into possession of a six-pound brass field piece, two iron four-pounders and two swivels." On February 26, Captain Helm, accompanied by fifty men the majority of them French militiamen," ascended the Wabash in three armed boats with the object of intercepting a party of British sent by Hamil- ton to bring on the stores at Ouiatanon." Besides making prisoners of forty men, seven boats heavily loaded with provisions and Indian goods valued at *Clark's Memoir, post, 289. *See Hamilton's Report, post, 207. *Clark's Memoir, post, 267. “In a letter of Joseph Bowman to Isaac Hite, June 14, 1779, he states that the goods captured amounted to twenty thousand pounds. *Ibid., post, 334.

Clark sent Hamilton, seven of his principal officers and eighteen other prisoners to the Falls of the Ohio under guard of Captain Williams, Lieutenant Rogers and twenty-five men.

He knew that with Detroit in his possession, the whole Northwest would be under his control. He was informed that the British garrison at that post, few in numbers, without adequate supplies and subject to still greater distresses with the cutting off of the Illinois country as a source, might be over- come with ease.” This desperate situation was expressed in a communication from Colonel Bolton to General Haldimand at Niagara as follows: “Capt. Lernoult acquaints me that Detroit is capable in peaceable times to supply the Garrison with Provisions, but at this time the inhabitants are so much employed in Conveys & probably will continue so that they have not been able to thrash last years corn, and the great number of cattle furnished for Governor Hamilton's expedition as well as for Detroit with what have been consumed by Indians, have reduced the numbers so much that a pair of oxen cannot be purchased for less than 1,000 Livres & then reckoned a cheap bargain. . . . . Flour is 60 Livres a hundred & every article very dear.” Besides, Clark had, with the same object in view, through his tact and liberal government, succeeded in winning the friendship of the Illinois French. The success of the expedition against Detroit, “in the execution of which,” as Clark later expressed it, “my very soul was wrapt,” was regarded as a certainty with the capture of Vincennes. The booty then 'Patrick Henry to Clark, January 15, 1778, post, 38. *Patrick Henry to the Virginia delegates in Congress, November 16, 1778, post, 72. "Mich. Pioneer and Hist. Coll., 1x., 427.

Again, Clark showed excellent judgment in his treatment of the French volunteers who had accom- panied the British troops. Instead of sending them to Virginia, as they had been led to expect, there to be held during the course of the war, they were discharged on taking the oath of neutrality. A few of them joined Clark's forces. Those returning to Detroit were pro- vided with boats, arms and provisions. The boats were to be sold upon arrival at their destination and the money therefrom was to be divided. This act, well calculated to promote Clark's interests among the French at Detroit, was successful.” “I after this,” wrote Clark, “had Spies, disguised as traders, constant to and from Detroit I learnt they answered every purpose that I could have wished for, by prejudiceing their friends in favour of America.” He was informed that the French at Detroit celebrated for three days the news of his victory over Hamilton and that the merchants were providing many necessaries which were to be given the Americans upon their arrival. That the Americans would triumph was a wish openly expressed and children in the streets, with cups of water were accustomed to drink success to Clark." Clark fully counted on the capture of Detroit. He assured the paroled prisoners that he would be there nearly as soon as they, and sent by them a copy of the alliance *Clark's Memoir, post, 291. *Beckwith, Ill. Hist.

Hamilton,” he wrote Captain Lernoult who was in charge at that post, “that you were very busy making new works, I am glad to hear it, as it saves the Ammericans some expences in building.” General gloom pervaded the garrisons at Detroit and Michillimackinac when it was learned that Hamilton had been captured and that two subordinate expedi- tions had likewise failed. Langlade, who had advanced as far as “Milwakee" on his way to assist Hamilton in an attack on the Illinois posts, was forced to return to Mackinac when his Indian followers refused to proceed further.” Gautier, also under orders of Hamil- ton to join him early in the spring, advanced with two hundred Indians over the Fox-Wisconsin course down the Mississippi as far as the mouth of the Rock River. Learning of Hamilton's capture, he made his way back to Green Bay.". In anticipation of an attacking party of Americans expected from Pittsburgh, the British ordered a new fort built at Detroit and carpenters were sent to repair the vessels." Urgent request was made that large re-enforcements should be sent from Niagara "Bowman's Journal, post, 164. *Clark to Lernoult, March 16, 1779, post, 306. The letter was sent by some of the inhabitants from Vincennes who went to Detroit accompanying the pris- oners on parole. General Haldimand wrote Sir Henry Clinton, May 26, 1779, as follows: “I enclose your Excellency copies of Governor Hamilton's capitu- lation, and of a letter from Col.

Presuming on the weakness of the garrison, the French refused to assist in the project. Spades, shovels and other tools neces- sary for carrying on the work were lacking. Provisions were scarce owing to the large quantities consumed on the expedition to Vincennes. The Indians tributary to Detroit were panic stricken and demanded that detachments of troops with cannon should be sent to them at once as they were not able to contend unaided with the enemy. “So situated,” wrote General Haldi- mand, “it will require great judgment and temper to preserve the Indians in our interest after so glaring and recent a proof of our want of strength, or want of con- duct. . . . . whenever they do quit us the valuable Fur Trade will immediately be lost to Great Britain.” British commanding officers in the Northwest were disheartened. Even before the capture of Hamilton, the fears of the officials at Detroit were so much excited that they demanded his return. “The loss of Governor Hamilton is a most feeling one to me," said Captain Lernoult in a dispatch from Detroit; “I find the burthen heavy without assistance. It requires, I confess, superior abilities, and a better constitution. . . . . I beg leave to repeat to you the necessity of a reinforcement being sent, as the consequences may be fatal.” His position was made still more trying through the burning of the Angelica, a boat being sent from Niagara with supplies for his relief. Major de Peyster was convinced that Mackinac, defended as it was by an inadequate *Draper MSS., 58J9. *General Haldimand to Lord George Germain. Beckwith, Ill. Hist. Coll., i., 446. *R. L.

Mystified by the report, purposely sent out by Clark, that he contemplated an advance on the post at Mackinac also, effort was made to render it defensible.” Clark was fully aware of the effects of his victory. “This stroke,” he said, “will nearly put an end to the Indian War, Had I but men enough to take the ad- vantage of the present confusion of the Indian Nations, I could silence the whole in two months.” The excitement incident to the capture of Vincennes over, many of his men succumbed to the effects of the cam- paign. Sickness among them increased and recovery was retarded owing to the unusually stormy days at the beginning of March." Clark did not at the time doubt the ultimate success of his plans to take Detroit, for in addition to his own men and the French militia, he counted on from two to three hundred men from Kentucky.

To avail himself of these re-enforcements and collect the necessary supplies the forward movement was deferred until June.” Meantime, he took up the problems of the territory already secured. The Indians first claimed his atten- tion. No man better understood how to win favor of the savages. He awaited the coming of the chiefs although he had not invited them to treat with him. In attendance upon their councils, he gave due regard to Indian ceremonial, strengthened the chain of friend- ship by smoking the sacred pipe and exchanging belts and when treaties were renewed, provided tafia and provisions with which the Indians were to make merry at the frolic usual at such times.” In dealing with the Indians who had refused the advances of the British, he “Extol'd them to the Skies ‘Dispatch from Governor Henry.

I consequently had observed one steady *Mason Letter, post, 146.

Whether they chose the peace-belt or the war-belt, they were told, was of little consequence for the Big Knives' greatest glory was in war and they were in search of enemies since the English were no longer able to contend against them. Those nations which did not lay down their arms at once were threatened with extermination.” Preparatory to his return to Kaskaskia with the remaining prisoners, Clark carefully arranged for a satisfactory government at Vincennes by appointing the faithful Captain Helm to take control of all civil matters and to act as superintendent of Indian affairs. Moses Henry was made Indian agent. The garrison of forty “picked” men was left in command of Lieuten- ant Richard Brashers, assisted by Lieutenants Bailey and Chapline.* Letters were sent John Bowman, then "Mason Letter, post, 147. *Ibid., post, 149.

No victorious army ever returned with spirits more elated than the eighty men who on March 20 accom- panied Clark. Within a year the authority of Virginia over the region stretching from the Ohio to the Illinois and one hundred and forty miles up the Wabash had been established by conquest." The danger that the frontier settlements would be cut off by savages under the leadership of British agents was greatly lessened. These results had been accomplished against odds that would have completely overcome men not already inured to the harsh condi- tions incident to life on the frontier. The six boats pushed off down the Wabash amidst the rejoicing of the people who had assembled to wish them a “good and safe passage.” A few of those, no doubt, who lingered to watch the boats until they were lost to view fully comprehended the results which had been attained. Their thought was expressed by one of their number as follows: “Although a handful in comparison to other armies, they have done themselves and the cause they were fighting for, credit and honor, and deserve a place in History for future ages; that their posterity may know the difficulty their forefathers had gone through for their liberty and freedom.

The problems and disappointments Clark was forced to meet during the succeeding three months were among the most trying of his whole career. Upon arrival, he found the people excited over the recent conduct of a party of Delaware warriors. Learning also of depre- dations committed at Vincennes by another party, Clark, by way of warning to the other tribes, ordered a ruthless war against the marauders. In the attacks on their villages which followed, no mercy was shown except for the women and children. The Indians soon sued for peace. IX.

At that time, he had paid bills drawn 'August 15, 1779.

The flour and meal which had been promised him had not been forwarded. “Being already drained of every shilling I could raise for the use of your's and the rest of the United States;" he wrote, “I went first to the Governor of this place, and then to every mer- chant in it, but could not prevail upon any of them to supply said goods, giving for their reason the few goods they had here imported, would in all probability become double the value of what they were just now, particu- larly at this juncture as war between Spain & Great Britain was daily expected, and the little probability there was of geting paid from your Quarter in any reasonable time, by depending only on the Letter of Credit & Mr. Lindsay's Contract.

Fully one- half of these represented the expense incident to the fitting out of the expedition against Vincennes. They were issued in favor of a number of the inhabitants of Illinois. These drafts had been received by the "Pollock to Henry, July 17, 1779. Draper MSS., 49J60.

While borrowing money on his own credit, Pollock, in order to encourage the shipment of arms, Indian goods, rum, sugar, etc. to the Illinois country and en- courage cargoes in exchange made up of deer-skins, beaver, otter and flour, and at the same time keep up the credit of the continental currency, continued until July 1779, to pay “Boatmen and Traders silver dollars for Paper Currency Dollar for Dollar.” Continental currency had been used but little in the West previous to the expedition against Vincennes. Confidence of the people in the government, together with the efforts of Pollock, sustained this money at par when it had so far depreciated in the East as to be worth only twelve cents on the dollar.” Traders from the East became aware of this situation and rushed to this region where goods might be procured with the certificates at their face value. They brought with them such large sums and distributed the money so liberally in trade that the inhabitants became alarmed and refused to receive it.

C ILLINOIS HISTORICAL COLLECTIONS passed the Virginia legislature establishing the county of Illinois which was to include the inhabitants of Virginia north of the Ohio River. This type of gov- ernment had been brought into general usage by Vir- ginia in her westward expansion.” The act providing for the county of Illinois was to remain in force for a year and “thence to the end of the next session of the assembly, and no longer.” The establishment of some temporary form of government was thought to be expedient, for, as stated in the act: “from their remote situation, it may at this time be difficult, if not impracticable, to govern them by the present laws of this commonwealth, until proper information, by inter- course with their fellow citizens, on the east side of the Ohio, shall have familiarised them to the same.” The chief executive officer was the county-lieutenant or commander in chief who was appointed by the gover- nor and council. He was to appoint, at his discretion, deputy commandants, militia officers and commis- saries. The civil officers with which the inhabitants were familiar whose duties were to administer the laws already in vogue were to be chosen by the citizens of the different districts. Officers with new duties were to be maintained by the state. Pardoning power was vested in the county-lieutenant in all criminal cases, murder and treason excepted. In these cases, he was empowered to stay execution until such time as the will of the governor or, in case of treason, of the assembly should be ascertained." Provision was made "For a history of this act see Boggess, The Settlement of Illinois, 9 et seq. Consult also Alvord, Cahokia Records (I. II.

FINANCES AND GOVERNMENT ci for the protection of the inhabitants in all of their religious, civil and property rights. The instructions issued by Governor Henry and the council, December 12, 1778, to Todd and to Clark, who was to retain the command of all Virginia troops in the county of Illinois, showed a grasp of the situa- tion. They were to co-operate in using their best efforts in cultivating and conciliating the affections of the French and Indians. The rights of the inhabitants were to be secured against any infractions by the troops, and any person attempting to violate the property of the Indians, especially in their lands, was to be punished. All Indian raids on Kentucky were to be prevented. The friendship of the Spaniards was to be maintained. As head of the civil department, Todd was to have “Command of the Militia, who are not to be under the Command of the Military until ordered out by the Civil Authority and act in conjunction with them.” He was directed on “all occasions to inculcate on the people the value of liberty and the difference between the State of free Citizens of this Commonwealth and that Slavery to which Illinois was destined A free and equal representation may be expected by them in a little time together with all the improvements in Juris- prudence and police which the other parts of the State enjoy." Todd reached Kaskaskia early in May.” His coming was hailed with pleasure by the inhabitants, who, *For a copy of these instructions, see post, 78,83. *Henry to Todd, December 12, 1778, post, 85. *The first satisfactory account of the inauguration and history of the courts in the county of Illinois was written by Mr. Alvord in the Introduction to the Cahokia Records (I.

cii ILLINOIS HISTORICAL COLLECTIONS having experienced some of the harshness incident to military control, were enthusiastic for a change, no matter what the new form of government might be. The county-lieutenant was well fitted to fill his office acceptably. Besides receiving a good general educa- tion, he had studied and practiced law for a time. Unable to resist the call of the frontier, he enlisted for service in Dunmore's War, and in 1775, then twenty- five years of age, went to Kentucky, where he was selected as one of the representatives to form a con- stitutional government for the settlement of Transyl- vania. In 1777, he was elected delegate to the Virginia House of Burgesses from the county of Kentucky." The intimate friendship existing between Todd and Clark and their known ability and bravery promised a successful solution of the problems with which they were confronted. May 12 was a notable day among the villagers of Kaskaskia for on that day Clark assembled them at the door of their church to hear the proclamation of the new government and participate in the election of judges. The address prepared by Clark, who acted as presiding officer of the meeting, was well suited to the occasion. “From your first declaration and attachment to the cause of the Americans,” he said. “until the glorious capture of the Post Vincennes, I doubted your sincerity; but at that critical moment I received proofs of your fidelity. I was so touched by the zeal which you there displayed that my desire at present is to make you happy, and to prove to you what sincere affection I have for the welfare and ad- vancement of this colony in general and of each one *Clark's Diary, post, 21.

Al- though there were some who did not take any part in that glorious act, still I have no less esteem for them, hoping that they will take revenge, if occasion presents itself; for during my absence they have done their duty in guarding the fort with the greatest care.” He promised, as soon as it was within his power, that they should become partakers in the liberty enjoyed by Americans and that a regiment of regular troops was to be sent for their protection. They were assured that the new government was one of such “kindliness” that they would bless the day they had chosen to favor the American cause. In presenting Colonel Todd he referred to him as his good friend and the only person in the state whom he desired to have take charge at that post. He spoke of the great importance of their meeting for the purpose of selecting the most capable and enlightened persons to judge their differences and urged that only those most worthy of the offices should be chosen. The brief response of Todd was likewise full of promise for the success of the new government which was to serve as guardian of their rights as citizens of a free and independent state.” Elections of judges for the district courts at Cakokia and Vincennes took place shortly afterwards and resulted, as at Kaskaskia, in the selection of Frenchmen.” On May 21, the *The translation is from Alvord, Kaskaskia Records (I.

One week earlier (May 14) military commissions were made out. A number of the men given officer's commissions had been elected judges and were thus expected to assume the duties of both offices." Within a few days, Todd was called on to hear a recital of the grievances of the French inhabitants which had been formulated by the Raskaskia justices. He was informed that a number of the oxen, cows and other animals belonging to the petitioners had been taken and killed by the soldiers; that liquor was being sold to Indians and trade carried on with slaves with- out the consent of their masters, both of which were contrary to French custom.” Licenses for carrying on trade were issued by Todd. Fearful lest there should be a repetition of the abuses under the Virginia land law, as practiced in Kentucky, and that adventurers and speculators would get pos- session of the rich bottom lands, he decreed that no new settlements should be made on the flat lands “unless in manner and form as heretofore made by the French inhabitants."3 "Five of the judges at Cahokia were also given military commissions.

A special tribunal was appointed in 1779, for the adjustment of disputes over land titles in Kentucky. Confusion was general because of the overlapping of grants. Some of these grants were based on the royal proclamation of 1763.

FINANCES AND GOVERNMENT CV No problem proved more trying for Todd and Clark than the effects produced by depreciated currency. Complications were greater on account of counterfeit money. By the close of April, the price of provisions was three times what it had been two months previous- ly and Clark was enabled to support his soldiers only by the assistance of a number of the merchants." While in Kentucky, Todd learned that the issues of currency bearing the dates April 20, 1777 and April 11, 1778, had been ordered to be paid into the conti- nental loan offices by the first of June, 1779 otherwise they would then become worthless. He hoped that time would be extended for the Illinois holders. Upon his ar- rival at Kaskaskia, Todd found that the paper money had depreciated so that it was worth only one-fifth of its face value in specie.” On June 11, therefore, with the desire of sustaining public credit, he addressed the court in the following letters: “The only method America has to support the present just War is by her Credit. That Credit at present is her Bills emitted from the different Treasuries by which she engages to pay the Bearer at a certain time Gold & Silver in Exchange. There is no friend to American Independance who has any Judgment but soon expects to see it equal to Gold & Silver.

cvi ILLINOIS HISTORICAL COLLECTIONS want of Credit." Todd proposed to retire a portion of the bills through exchanging them for land certifi- cates. Twenty-one thousand acres of land in the vicin- ity of Cahokia were set aside on which it was planned to borrow thirty-three thousand dollars in Virginia and United States treasury notes. The lender might demand, within two years, his proportion of the land or a sum in gold or silver equal to the original loan with five per cent annual interest. Land or money might be given at the option of the state. Large sums of money were exchanged for these certificates, but the project could not be carried farther. X. PLANS TO CAPTURE DETROIT But Detroit was uppermost in the minds of the two leaders, and preparations were rapidly made for the expedition which promised complete success.” In this they were following the orders explicitly given by Gov- ernor Henry. “The Inhabitants of Illinois,” so read the instructions to Todd, “must not expect settled peace and safety while their and our Enemies have footing at Detroit and can interrupt or stop the Trade of the Mississippi. If the English have not the strength or courage to come to war against us themselves, their practice has been and will be to hire the Savages to commit murder and depredations. Illinois must ex- pect to pay in these a large price for her Freedom, unless the English can be expelled from Detroit. The means of effecting this will not perhaps be found in "Chicago Hist. Soc., Collections, iv., 297. *Mason Letter, post, 150. Joseph Bowman to Isaac Hite, June 14, 1779. post, 332.

But the French inhabiting the neighbourhood of that place, it is presumed, may be brought to see it done with indifference or perhaps join in the enterprise with pleasure. This is but con- jecture. When you are on the spot you and Col Clarke may discover its fallacy or reality.” The forti- fications at that post were still unfinished and the garrison consisted of only one hundred men.” Captain Linctot, a trader of great influence with the Indians, who had recently joined the Americans, was sent up the Illinois with a company of forty men to secure the neutrality of the Indians" and at the same time cover the design of the main expedition against Detroit." He reported, on his return, that peace and quietness was general as far as “Wea.” Great enthusiasm was manifest on the part of officers, troops and the French militia. On no occasion does Clark appear to a better advantage than in the appeal which he made for the support of the young men, many of whom had accompanied him on the expedition against Vincennes, returning, as he said, “covered with laurels.” He assured them that their deeds and faith- ful conduct were well known throughout America. Not only were the villagers ready to enlist, some of the old men volunteering their services, but like enthusiasm As head of the civil department, Todd was to have command of the militia, “who are not to be under the Command of the Military until ordered out by the Civil Authority and act in conjunction with them.” Henry to Tºdd, December 12, 1778, post, 85. “But you are to push at º favor- able Occurrences which Fortune may present to you.

cviii ILLINOIS HISTORICAL COLLECTIONS was general at Vincennes among the people and Ameri- can officers and Clark was assured that not only the inhabitants at Ouiatanon and Miami but the garrisons also were ready to declare in his favor." The arrival of Colonel John Montgomery from Wir- ginia with one hundred and fifty men, about one-third the number expected, was a keen disappointment to Clark. But he did not lose confidence, for he had been promised three hundred Kentuckians by Colonel John Bowman, their county-lieutenant. On July 1, Clark, with a party of horsemen, reached Vincennes, the place of rendezvous. Here he was joined by the remainder of the Illinois troops, with the exception of a company of mounted men dispatched under Captain Linctot to reconnoiter and to obtain permission of the Wea and Miami for Clark to pass through their country on his way to Detroit. Before leaving Kaskaskia, Clark learned that Colonel John Bowman had led the Kentucky forces against Chillicothe, a Shawnee town, and was fearful of the effect on his Detroit plans. This expedition consisted of two hundred and ninety-six men.” The Indians fortified themselves so strongly in a few log cabins that the whites were repulsed. The greater part of the town was burned and Bowman retreated with a large amount of plunder.” Influenced by Clark's victories, "Bowman to Clark, June 3, 1779, post, 327. *Bowman to Clark, June 13, 1779, post, 322.

Some returned to the older settlements for their families and the others were scattered over such a large area that, to Bowman, it seemed impossible to secure the number of men he had promised Clark by the time appointed,” especially since the militia were so disheartened by the campaign against the Shawnee that only the most tried among them were ready to enter upon a new enterprise. The arrival of only thirty Kentucky volunteers was a severe blow to Clark.” The capture of Detroit with his available force of about three hundred and fifty appeared at the time, out of the question. Besides, most of his men were barefoot." Vincennes was able to supply scarcely enough provisions for its own in- habitants. All commerce with Detroit had ceased and supplies could be gotten by the way of the Mississippi only with great difficulty owing to the attachment of the southern Indians to the British. “Never was a person more mortified that I was at this time, to see so fair an opportunity to push a victory; Detroit lost sent a runner there. Col. Bowman hearing the negroes account, ordered a retreat. We burned all their town except the Council house kild Blackfish in the Council house took all the Richest of their plunder and one Hundred and sixty three horses. . . . . Col.

Had your Instructions come four weaks Sooner I had Gethered 296 Men and Marched them to one of the Shawnee towns.” Bowman had been assured also by William Linn, who was at the Falls of the Ohio, that he was ready to join Clark with one hundred men. *Clark's Memoir, post, 300. -ºrderly Book of the conductor general at Fort Patrick Henry, July 26, 1779 in Va.

Although abandoned, the influence of the prepara- tion for the expedition proved of great significance. Threatenings from Vincennes led the British officials at Detroit to give up their plans for the recapture of that post." A summer campaign of regulars and Indians against Fort Pitt was likewise abandoned. The British at Detroit and Mackinac were engaged in considering defensive operations and re-enforcements were hurried to these posts.” Notwithstanding the large expendi- tures for rum and presents for the warriors and food for the old men, women and children, disaffection among the Indians became constantly more open.” French and Indians were frightened over the report that an alliance between the French, Spanish, Germans and Americans had been formed with the object of driving the English out of America." “The summer,” as Clark expressed it, “was spent to advantage as we ware carefull to spread such reports as suited our Interest.” Before setting out for the Falls of the Ohio where he had determined to establish *Draper MSS., 49J41; 1B104; 58J37. *Haldimand to Clinton, May 31, 1779. *Draper MSS., 58J39.

When he reached the falls, he found the work of settling on the mainland going forward rapidly.” Influenced by the reports of Clark's victories and the stories of returning travelers that rich land might be easily acquired, immigrants in large numbers entered Kentucky, some descending the Ohio, others coming by the wilderness road. Seventy men and several families reached the falls in one day during April. Several hundred were then reported to be ready to set out from Virginia. Glowing accounts describing this region as the "richest under the sun” continued to induce increasing numbers of immigrants to enter Kentucky during the summer. The soil could not, it was said, be surpassed in richness; vast natural meadows furnished a range which seemed inexhaustible and great herds of buffalo, elk and deer were common.” So great was the impulse ‘Colonel Montgomery was chief in command.

From that day until the first of May following, when the first entries on these warrants were allowed, Kentucky was visited by large numbers of explorers who hoped to locate their warrants most advantageously. Upon the open- ing of the land office, the rush was so great that for several days the time of three men was devoted entirely to receiving and receipting for these warrants.” By order of the county court, a regular government for the town which received the name of Louisville was established through the selection of seven trus- tees.” The plan submitted by Clark to the surveyors engaged in laying off the town would, if adopted, have *Draper MSS, 1L71.

For- getting his boast that he would place a pair of hand- cuffs on every rebel officer left in the country, he re- treated from St. Joseph's upon hearing the report that Clark was marching towards Detroit.” Early in June, Captain Henry Bird collected some two hundred Indians at the Mingo town. The account brought in by runners of the attack which had been made by Colonel Bowman on the Shawnee towns produced a panic among his followers. Some of the savages deserted in order to protect their villages against the American advance which was momentarily expected.

By this time winter, long remembered as the “hard winter,” had set in. For three months, snow covered the ground and the rivers were frozen to the bottom. Most of the cattle and thousands of buffalo, deer, turkeys and other animals perished. Settlers were reduced to the utmost extremity for want of bread. “One johnny-cake was often divided into twelve equal parts twice each day.” Corn rose from fifty dollars a bushel in November to two hundred dollars in March.” “If we was only now in Old Virginia,” one exclaimed, “we could have something good to eat and drink but hear we have nothing to eat in this dreary wilderness and we dont know when we shall have.” The suffering of many families on their way to Kentucky who were forced to pass the winter on the Cumberland was even Imore extreme.* But by February 20, winter had disappeared and the tide of immigration again set in with increasing *Draper MSS., 4CC25; 57J47.

With the usual promises to pay, he engaged workmen to construct one hundred boats which were to be completed within two months. They were to be used to transport provisions on this expedition. But to large numbers of the frontiersmen their dangers were immediate and promise of relief in an indefinite future was not satisfying. They interpreted what seemed a disregard of their petitions as further evidence of indifference on the part of Virginia towards their rights. Throughout the summer the desire grew for complete separation from the control of Virginia. The dissatisfaction growing out of the methods by which lands were acquired became more intense. This spirit was expressed as follows: “We have distressing news from Kentucke which is entirely owing to a set of Nabobs in Virginia taking all the lands there by office warrants, & Pre-Emption Rights—Hundreds of families are ruined by it. In short it threatens a loss of that county—Should the English go there and offer them Protection from the Indians the greatest part will join—It is a truth that the people There publicly say it—Let the great men say they, who the Land belongs to come & defend it for we will not lift up a gun in Defense of it.” Others protested against being taxed while they were engaged in defending the country "Draper MSS., 46J59.

A memorial setting forth these facts signed by six hundred and seventy-two inhabitants was presented to Congress and the request was made that Kentucky and Illinois should be made into a separate state or that their government should be under the control of Congress." Little attention was paid to the request and Clark by suppressing this movement interfered with the success of his own project to establish a post near the mouth of the Ohio.” Writing his brother, August 23, 1780, he said: “The partizans in these Cuntries are again Soliciting me to head them as their Governor General as all those from foreign States are for a new Government but my duty obliging me to Suppress all such proceedings I consequently shall loose the Interest of that party.” Some months earlier Clark gave his reasons for a fort at the mouth of the Ohio. It would become at Once, he thought, the key to the trade of the West and in protecting this trade, he had been forced to station an armed boat so as to command the navigation of both rivers.

In 1777, Patrick Henry advocated building a fort at the same spot for the purpose of facilitating intercourse with the Spaniards at New Orleans? Governor Galvez was in complete accord with this proposal, for freedom of trade on the Mississippi would in part make up for the loss of ocean commerce which had been greatly disturbed by British cruisers. At the time, however, the British held and had fortified Natchez and Manchac, and thus precluded the descent of American boats. In his secret instructions to Clark, Governor Henry again referred to the establishment of this post which he thought might be fortified by the cannon secured at Kaskaskia.” The establish- ment of some such stronghold was necessary. During the spring the British were regaining their control over the Indians and were again about to attempt the re- capture of the Illinois country. As a check to such an expedition and at the same time to furnish a stronghold for the protection of the western country against the encroachments of the Spaniards, Clark and Todd agreed to concentrate the troops at a fort to be built at the mouth of the Ohio."

On April 14, Clark set out from Louisville for the purpose of building this fort which was finally located five miles below the mouth of the Ohio, at the “Iron Banks,” and was named Fort Jefferson. Settlers were attracted to this location through the promise of four hundred acres of land to each family at a price to be fixed by the general assembly.” The troops were withdrawn from Vincennes and Fort Patrick Henry was garrisoned only by a company of French militia under Major Bosseron. Orders were sent Colonel Montgomery to retire most of the troops from the Illinois villages. But before the evacuation actually took place it was learned that an attack by the British was imminent. With the series of events thus introduced, Clark was forced to forego the expedition to Detroit. XIII.

With this object in view, a treaty between France and Spain was agreed upon in April, 1779. The formal declaration of war against Great Britain quickly followed and in July of that year Governor Galvez was authorized to attack Natchez and other British posts on the east bank of the Mississippi." On June 17, the day following the declaration of war by Spain, Lord George Germain directed General Haldimand to order hostilities to begin immediately with an attack on New Orleans and other Spanish posts on the river." General Campbell was ordered to proceed up the Mississippi to Natchez with an army "General Carleton, as early as October, 1776, was advised by Rocheblave, & the correspondence between the colonists and the Spanish governor at \ew Orleans.

In spite of an adverse decision by his council, Gover- nor Galvez determined, on his own authority, to attack at once the British posts.” He marshaled a force of fourteen hundred and thirty men, made up of regular troops, militia, and volunteers—among the last being Oliver Pollock and nine other Americans. Although poorly equipped for offensive operations, Galvez led his force against Fort Manchac and captured it on Sep- tember 8. Baton Rouge, a strongly fortified post, was the next object of attack. By clever strategy the Spaniards gained an advantage which led to a capitu- lation September 21. Not only did they gain posses- sion of this post with its five hundred defenders and thirteen pieces of heavy artillery but the terms of surrender also included Natchez one hundred and thirty miles up the river.” Galvez, returning to New Orleans, made active preparations for an expedition against Mobile. Because of his successes, no difficulties were encountered in securing a force of two thousand men, with which he set sail early in February, 1780. Mobile was surrendered without the necessity of an assault. During the progress of these events, General Campbell with his fifteen hundred regular troops re- mained at Pensacola, making little effort to carry out the orders of his government. Galvez made every preparation during the remainder of the year to go against this strongly fortified and well garrisoned post- 1Sinclair to Brehm, February 15, 1780, Wis. Hist.

With Pensacola, the province of West Florida also became a Spanish possession. Meantime, the British authorities at Mackinac and Detroit lost no time in carrying out their orders. A war party of Indians was dispatched by Lieutenant- Governor Sinclair of Mackinac to enlist the services of Wabasha, the illustrious chief of the Sioux, who was attached to the British interests and could at the time muster two hundred warriors from his tribe.” Wabasha was to proceed with all dispatch as far down as Natchez, there to join General Campbell, having made as many intermediate attacks as possible.” Sinclair entrusted the command of an expedition against the Spanish and Illinois country—the conquest of which would be an easy task as he believed—to a trader, Emanuel Hesse." On February 15, 1780, Cap- tain Hesse was ordered to assemble for that purpose, at the portage of the Fox and Wisconsin rivers, the Menominee, Sauk, Foxes and Winnebago. Accompanied by these Indians, and with a plentiful stock of provi- Sions, Hesse descended the Wisconsin to the Mississippi, Where he was joined by Matchikuis and his Ottawa ‘Gayarré, Hist. of Louisiana, III., 135 et seq. º: Sioux were selected for they were, as stated by Sinclair, “undebauched Żºłcted. to War, & Jealously attached to His Majesty's Interest.” (Wis.

An expedition dispatched to the lead mines succeeded in capturing seventeen prisoners and large quantities of supplies and prevented the shipment of fifty tons of lead ore." Various motives were adduced to stir up enthusiasm for the expedition. The northern Indians were incited through the opportunity thus offered to fall on their hereditary foes, the Illinois tribes.” Tra- ders who should aid in securing the Spanish posts were to be given the exclusive right to the Missouri trade for the ensuing winter."

The Americans at the beginning of the war were scarcely aware of the existence of such a village. They were ignorant of its location, as is manifest from the following incident. Colonel George Morgan, Indian agent at Pittsburg, in a letter of inquiry to Governor Henry early in the year 1777, says: “The County Lieutenant who is order'd to send 100 Men to meet Cap Lynn with the Powder, is at a loss to know how far to proceed or where St Louis on the Missisippi is— There being one place of that name 160 Miles above the mouth of Ohio–and no settlement or Fort less than 400 Miles below the Ohio The nearest is at the River Arkansa.” In the absence of the governor, John Page, the acting governor answered with splendid offi- cial agreeableness: “We are as much at a loss to know where St. Louis is, as you can be, but suppose it to be where you mention.” St. Louis was really discovered to the Americans by George Rogers Clark."

If these hungry wolves had contented themselves with destroying the crops, if they had killed all the cattle which they could not take with them, this act would have been looked upon as a con- sequence of war, but when the learned world shall know that this desperate band slaked their thirst in the blood of innocent victims, and sacrificed to their fury all whom they found, cruelly destroying them and committing the greatest atrocities upon some poor people who had no other arms than those of the good faith in which they lived, the English nation from now on may add to its glorious conquests in the present war that of having barbarously inflicted by the hands of the base instruments of cruelty the most bitter torments which tyranny has invented.” So the Spanish account ends after reciting that the number of the killed and wounded was twenty-nine, and that twenty-four were made prisoners."

But in addition to these three there was another and it must be believed, more potent cause for the precipi- tate retreat which followed and the total defeat of the ultimate objects hoped for by the British officials. That was the opportune appearance of George Rogers Clark, who was supposed to be beyond striking distance at the Falls of the Ohio.” As indicated, Clark had been engaged since April 18, in constructing a fort at the Iron Banks. Citizens of Cahokia, through Charles Gratiot, hastened to inform him of their alarming situation and urged him to come at once to their relief.

The statement has often been made and as frequently denied that Clark before the attack on Cahokia crossed the river to St. Louis and that it was his influence which caused the retreat of the British. He claimed for himself and his men the honor of having saved St. Louis and the rest of Louisiana for the Spaniards.” It may well be believed that the knowledge that he was in the vicinity caused the Indians to withdraw. The main body of the attacking force retreated rapidly in two divisions—one by the Mississippi, the other directly across the country to Mackinac.” Langlade and his force escaped in two vessels and in canoes, thus preventing an attack on them by a force of two hundred Illinois cavalry which arrived at “Chicago “When Gen. Clark arrived at Coho he was informed that the number of men at St. Louis collected at Kaskaskia and other places was between 300 and 400. He went over to St. Louis to review the troops as well as the works of defence. The Spanish commandant at St. Louis, on the arrival of Clark, offered him the command of both sides; but Clark declined taking the conn- mand until he could ascertain where the assault would be made. He contin- ued only about two hours in St. Louis when he returned to Coho.” (Stipp. Western Miscellany, 54 et seq.)

THE STRUGGLE FOR THE MISSISSIPPI CxxxV five days after his departure.” Clark at once organized aforce of some three hundred and fifty regulars, French volunteers from the Illinois posts and Spaniards of St. Louis, which he sent under Colonel Montgomery against the Sauk and Foxes. Proceeding up the Mississippi and the Illinois in boats as far as Peoria, they marched to the Indian villages on Rock River. But the Indians had fled.” After burning the towns, Montgomery returned to his boats. The retreat of four hundred miles was accomplished after much suffering due to the almost total lack of provisions.” During the winter and spring of 1780, Major de Peyster lavished vast treasure upon the assembled tribes in order to satisfy their ever-growing demands and prepare them to assist in carrying out another part of the comprehensive plan for the conquest of the West. It was hoped to dislodge the Americans at the Falls of the Ohio; and thus, by cutting the communi- cation between Fort Pitt and the West, force the sur- render of the Illinois posts." Besides, immigrants were pouring into Kentucky in such numbers as to excite the apprehensions of the British officials."

So terrible was the havoc wrought by these scouting parties upon the defenseless families scattered through the woods of Kentucky that petitions from various communities were sent to Clark asking that he come to the rescue lest the whole country should become a “mere scene of carnage and Desolation.” “If you could Assist us in that peticular,” they said, and, “Honour our interprize with your Presence and Com- mand you would have the Consolation of redeeming from Destruction a Scattered divided and Defenceless People who have no other Probable source of defence but through your means.” Early in May, Captain Bird, accompanied by one hundred and fifty whites and one thousand Indians well armed, and with two pieces of light artillery, set out from Detroit.” His route was by way of the Mau- mee and the Miami rivers to the Ohio.

In order to deceive the lurking bands of Savages, they disguised themselves as Indians. On approaching the Tennessee River, they were discovered by a party of Indians, and narrowly escaped capture. They crossed the Tennessee and the Kentucky rivers on rafts which they made by binding logs together with grapevines. Harrodsburg was reached a short time before the news that Ruddle's and Martin's stations were captured by the British. Clark began at once the organization of a retaliatory expedition. With characteristic decision, he ordered the land office closed until he should return from the expedition, and proceeded to enlist volunteers from the crowd eagerly awaiting the opportunity to get an assignment of land. This order provoked general discontent on the part of speculators, but the call for volunteers was cheerfully met by the people in general, and one thousand men were soon under arms.” So eager were they to deal a blow to the Shawnee who had been their most persistent enemy that in some cases only the boys, old men and women were left to guard the stations."

Clark himself at the head of the two other divisions forded the river and began a rapid movement towards the lower end of the town. A body of Indians hidden in Some woods began the attack and the action quickly became general with a savage fierceness on both sides. The fighting was continuous over the broken plain of a mile and a half to the town. Driven from one wooded elevation, the savages escaped through the fields of corn to another until they finally took refuge under the protection of the fort and nearby cabins and waited for the assault. Within half an hour Clark renewed the attack, bringing into use for the first time the small cannon which had been brought on the back of a pack- horse. The rifle-shots from the Indians, owing to the distance, were of no effect, whereas their stonghold was shattered by the shot from the cannon. At sun- down, unable longer to resist the attack, the savages left their fort. In escaping, some of them came so close to Clark's lines that the fighting was renewed at close range. At this time, Joseph Rogers, a cousin of Clark's, who for two years had been a prisoner among the Indians, made his escape and running towards the Americans shouted to them not to shoot him for he was a white man.” He was mortally wounded, however, Wilson's account says fifteen hundred warriors.

The presence of Patrick Henry, Richard Henry Lee, George Mason and other Virginia leaders in the House of Delegates promised a more aggressive policy in the West. Governor Jefferson, with full appreciation of the significance of the capture of Detroit, had appealed to Washington to furnish powder for the expedition the burden of which was otherwise to be borne by Virginia. Jefferson was aware that prompt action was necessary for there was unmistakable evidence that a British expedition would be sent against Ken- tucky in the spring. Clark proceeded to Richmond to consult over the means possible for checking this formidable invasion. By December 25, full instructions were drawn up under which Clark was to advance with two thousand men into the hostile territory at the earliest practicable moment after the opening of navigation. The ultimate object of the expedition was to be the reduction of Detroit and the acquisition of Lake Erie.” Such a movement was intended to place the British on the defensive. If no check were given their advance in this way, it was feared that militia would ultimately have to be withdrawn from the South to be sent against them. The effects which were expected to follow the reduc- tion of Detroit were stated by Jefferson in the following: "If that Post be reduced we shall be quiet in future ‘Jefferson to Clark, December 25, 1780.

By March 15, the Kentucky militia were to rendezvous at the Falls of the Ohio, and ammunition and provisions for the entire force were to be collected at the same place by that time.” The promise for success was greater when it was known that Washington was ready to answer the appeal for assistance. “I have ever been of opinion,” he wrote Jefferson, “that the reduction of the post of Detroit would be the only certain means of giving peace and security to the whole western frontier, and I have constantly kept my eye upon that object . . . . .

This was not possible under the established rule which forbade the granting of such a commission to officers in state regiments. On January 22, however, Clark was made brigadier- general “of the forces to be embodied on an expedition westward of the Ohio.” This act completed an effec- tive military organization in the West. The preceding November, on account of the rapid growth of the population in the county of Kentucky, the legislature of Virginia divided it into the three counties of Fayette, *Washington, Writings (Sparks ed.), vii., 341.

John Floyd occupied the same position in Jefferson county, and Benjamin Logan in Lincoln. Clark, as superior officer, was to supervise the work of these three. For some time Clark had been engaged, under the direction of Baron Steuben, in carrying on a defensive movement against Benedict Arnold. The day follow- ing the receipt of Washington's approval for the western expedition, Jefferson directed Clark to secure his re- lease in order that he might set out for the frontier.” But Clark was not well on his way to Fort Pitt before Jefferson was made aware of difficulties which must be overcome if the enterprise were to succeed. The issue of orders for the drafting of the militia of Berkeley County to go immediately to the Falls of the Ohio served to demonstrate that extreme measures would be necessary to induce men to enlist. “We beg leave to represent to your Excellency,” so the recruiting officers wrote, “that we have seventy men on duty from this County, now in the Southern army, which with the 68, we are to raise for the army and the 275 now ordered into service will make near one-half of the militia of this County fit for duty—From these circum- stances and the immense distance from here to the falls of the Ohio, being by the way of Fort Pitt, little less than a thousand miles, we are sorry to inform your "In general, Fayette County extended east from the Kentucky River, corn- prising the northeastern portion of the present state.

By the report of the county-lieutenant not more than twenty guns were available for the two hundred and eighty men to be equipped.” Officers of Greenbrier County, in answer to entreaties from the inhabitants who were fearful of the dangers to which they would be exposed upon the withdrawal of so large a force, requested that their quota for the continental army should not be demand- eduntil the return of the militia about to leave for the West.” Attempts to collect provisions and men in Hampshire County resulted in the actual mutiny of Some seventy men.

Accumulation of supplies for the expedition was so much delayed that the time of setting out from Fort Pitt was extended to June. After three weeks' deliber- ation, Congress agreed to grant the request of the Board of War for supplies. Three weeks longer were necessary for their collection owing to the lack of both men and money.” The kegs in which powder was being for- warded from Philadelphia were so poor that a delay of two weeks was necessary at one point in order to make new Ones.” During this period of waiting Clark learned of the abuses incident to the conduct of public affairs in the West. Instances were cited in which goods belonging to the state were used in carrying on private trade with the Indians. Laborers in public employment were accused of performing only one-tenth as much work as those who were engaged on tasks of their own." Reports of the subordination of public interests to private gain were not, however, confined to any one section. It was a period when sheriffs in Virginia were accused of misappropriating large sums of county money with which to invest in 1and office warrants."

That volunteers joined this expedition in order to avoid accompanying Clark cannot be definitely assert- ed but it is certain his enlistments were materially affected thereby. Colonel Brodhead now sought some argument which would excuse his policy of opposition to Clark. He was desirous of winning laurels for him- self and a number of times had appealed to Washington for permission to organize an expedition against Detroit and Natchez and for assistance in carrying it forward.” Brodhead was convinced that he was well within his instructions in refusing to grant Clark's request for a regiment. His orders read: “You will likewise direct the officers with the company of artillery to be ready to move, when Colonel Clark shall call for them; and, as it is my wish to give the enterprise every aid, which our small force can afford, you will be pleased to form such a detachment as you can safely spare from your own and Gibson's regiments, and put it under the com- mand of Colonel Clarke also.

RENEWAL OF PLANS AGAINST DETROIT cliii Clark's position was likewise tenable, for he had inter- preted Jefferson's dispatch to mean that by the con- sent of Baron Steuben and Washington, he was to be accompanied by Colonel Gibson's regiment and Heath's Company. Both men appealed to Washington. “From your Excellencies letters to Colº Broadhead,” Clark wrote, "I conceived him to be at liberty to furnish what men he pleasd. . . . . If you should aprove of the troops in this department Joining our forces tho they are few the acquisition may be attended with great & good consequences as two Hundred only might turn the Scale in our favour.” The next day he appealed again for assistance, saying, “For in part it has been the Influence of our posts in the Illinoise and Ouabash that have Sayd the frontiers and in a great measure baffled the designs of the Enemy at Detroit If they get posses- sion of them they then Command three times the num- ber of Valuable warriors they do at present and be fully Enabled to carry any point they aim at Except We should have a formidable force to oppose them.” Clark assumed that his request would be granted. Regular officers and soldiers were desirous of going on the expedition which was supposed to be aimed against the Indians.” While awaiting Washington's reply, boats were completed and provisions collected.

A general draft was finally resorted to.” Enforcement of the order in Monongalia County brought on a riot.” Among other problems demanding Clark's attention besides the suppression of this mob," was the difficulty of securing supplies with a currency which steadily depreciated in value." Findings of the general court martial were reviewed by him in which such questions were considered as the legality of drafting, punishment of horse-thieves and embezzlement of public property." Clark's problems were still more complicated because of a dispatch from Washington by which he was in- formed that Colonel John Connolly was about to join forces with Sir John Johnson and come by the way of Lake Ontario against Fort Pitt and other western posts.” *Draper MSS., 51J49, 56. *Ibid., 30J91. *Ibid., 51J58. *See post, 568. “We the subscribers being Accessary to a Riot in Sup- ressing a draught in this county on the 12th Inst Being Sensible of our Error and as a security of our future good conduct do hereby Engage to Serve Ten months in the continental Service in case we should be guilty of the like misdeminor.” *Colonel Gibson to Clark.

RENEWAL OF PLANS AGAINST DETROIT clv In the midst of these preparations, social life at Fort Pitt was not lacking. “We have heard,” wrote Colonel Gibson, “that the Gentlemen and Ladies of tewarts Crossing's intend paying us a visit tomorrow, in Consequence of which a grand Bower is erected in the Orchard, a Barbacue is preparing for tomorrow and a Ball in the Evening at Col Gibson's Room.” The celebration of the “Aniversary of our Glorious Independance” also received due attention.” While the necessary supplies had been collected by the first of June at a cost approaching two million dollars the weeks wore on with Clark still hoping to Secure the requisite number of volunteers.” His appeals to Washington, that Colonel Gibson's regiment might be permitted to accompany him, failed." Drafts were of slight avail, and finally, early in August, despairing of accomplishing his designs in the face of deep-seated Opposition on the part of the officials of the western counties of Pennsylvania, he set out for Louisville, "Gibson to Clark, post, 570. *Draper MSS., 51J65.

Clark hoped his force would be re-enforced in Kentucky and that he might still accomplish his object or at least make some demonstration against the disaffected Indians.” Be- fore setting out, he was forced to draw on his supplies in order to relieve the distressed condition of the gar- rison at Fort Pitt.* Plans were outlined whereby Colonel Gibson was to lead an attack against the Wyandot, September 4, and Clark was to march at the same time from the mouth of the Miami upon the Shawnee villages. Clark's preparations had served as a defense for the frontiers. Efforts were redoubled to put Detroit in condition to withstand an attack." Demands for presents made by the Indians in council at that post increased “amazingly.” By the end of May, the *Cal. Va. State Papers, II., 345. In a letter to Colonel Davies, W. Croghan declared that the reason Clark was able to get so few men at Fort Pitt was “owing to the dispute that subsists here between the Virginians & Pennsyl- vanians respecting the true bounds of the Latter. And the General being a Virginian was opposed by the most noted men here of the Pennsylvania Party. The people here bleam Virginia very much for making them & their lands (which beyond a shadow of a doubt is far out of the true bounds of pensyl- vania) over to pennsylvania.” Draper MSS., 16S54 et seq. The force accompanying Clark was composed of Colonel Crockett's regiment of Virginia state troops and Captain Craig's company of artillery, together with volunteers and militia. Clark was repre- sented by some of the leading men opposed to him as a flour merchant, and again as a trader and land jobber for the state of Virginia. (Draper MSS., 52J18.) James Marshall, county-lieutenant of Washington County and County-Lieutenants Cook and Davis, were named by Clark as his main op- ponents. (Clark to President Reed, August 4, 1781, post, 579.) Marshall advised the people to pay no attention to the drafts ordered for Clark and offered protection to those who refused. He had told Clark that while he could do nothing for the expedition as an official that as a private person he would give every assistance within his power. Pa.

FAILURE clvii fears of the British and their allies were increased by the report that Clark was descending the Ohio with One thousand men and that this number would be increased by a like number from Kentucky. Their confidence was restored through a dispatch from General Haldimand contradicting this rumor and assuring them that Detroit and the Indian country were in no danger. They were ordered to act at once in order to prevent the farther strengthening of the frontier settlements.” Such an order meant war on Combatant and non-combatant alike. XVI. FAILURE While a force of one hundred rangers under Captain Andrew Thompson and three hundred Indians under Captain McKee were advancing to the Ohio to waylay Clark, Captain Joseph Brant at the head of one hundred whites and Indians surprised a body of one hundred and seven Pennsylvania volunteers under Colonel Archibald Lochry which was descending the Ohio to join Clark. This company of picked men from Westmoreland County reached Fort Wheeling a few hours after Clark's departure. On August 16, eight men were sent for- ward with a letter to Clark. Five of them were cap- tured and from the letter Brant learned that Lochry was coming down the river. His plan of attack was completely successful.

Attempting to escape across the river they were surprised by another party, one-third of their number were killed and the remainder made prisoners." A number of the prisoners, including Colonel Lochry, were afterwards murdered. After marching with their prisoners a few miles up the Miami, the victors met the forces led by Thompson and McKee. The Indians were satisfied with what had been accomplished and believed that their villages would now be safe. With great difficulty they were persuaded that security from invasion lay only in attacking Clark. On September 9, they were within twenty-five miles of the falls. Scouts there came in with two prisoners from whom it was learned that Clark could not with his small force undertake an expedition. But the Indians were not disposed to attack him and numerous small bands deserted, some returning to their villages while others scoured the country, burning cabins and stealing horses. The rangers were without food and insisted on retreating towards Detroit.” All the posts anxiously awaited Clark's return. The new fort at the falls had been completed as he had directed. For months, however, the garrison had suffered through a lack of clothing and food. Early the previous winter Captain Slaughter declared: “My men have no shirts, hats, blankets or Breeches, not having drawn Cloath for that purpose, shoes, Stockings, 1 Mich. Pioneer and Hist.

Ammunition and provisions were scarce and the settlers sought the protection of the forts or fled panic-stricken to the stronger settlements. “There is scarce one fort in the county but once a month seems upon the eve of breaking for want of men to defend it,” John Todd wrote in April. “Such residents,” he continued, “as had most property and Horses to remove their effects, have retreated to Lincoln. One half of the remainder are unable to remove. We have no tax Commissioners in the County & almost nothing to tax.” *See post, 584. *Colonel Floyd to Clark, April 26, 1781.

Dissatisfaction with American rule on the part of the inhabitants prevailed. Avarice, prodigality and petty strife among the officers were continuous.” The situation at Vincennes was similar. Oliver Pollock, as already noted, had been unable to meet the bills drawn on the treasury of Virginia. Colonel Le Gras stated the situation as follows: “I beg you if you can to send me in place of this same bill of exchange one of the same amount as those which are sent you from the treasury of Virginia for 1752 dollars in order to procure me some means of ministering to my pressing wants.’’3 Continental money had been accepted by them in good faith following the assurance by American officers that it was equal in value to silver. Refusing to ac- cept it in payment for provisions, they were commanded by public order to receive it or become subject to punishment. ‘See post, 530.

clxii ILLINOIS HISTORICAL COLLECTIONS During February a detachment of regular troops had been sent to Vincennes from Fort Jefferson and their exactions were intolerable to the French. In a memorial to the governor of Virginia, they recited all their grievances since the time Clark left them. “They have perpetrated others,” they relate, “of a more serious character by killing our cattle in the fields and our hogs in our yards, taking our flour from the mills, and the corn in our garners, with arms in their hands threatening all who should resist them, and the destruction of the fort we built at our own cost. . . . . If it be thus you treat your friends, pray what have you in reserve for your enemies?” Exhausted through repetition of these abuses, the French settlers finally retaliated. Captain Bailey, in charge of the garrison, declared: “I must inform you once more that I cannot keep Garrison any longer without some speedy relief from you my Men have been 15 days upon half allowance, there is plenty of provisions here but no credit, I cannot press being the weakest party some of the Gentlemen would help us but their Credit is as bad as ours therefore if you have not provisions send whiskey which will answer as good an end.” What was to be done by Clark in this crisis. His own force had been greatly depleted by desertions and the time of enlistment for the majority of the regular troops at Louisville was about to expire. The loss of Colonel Archibald Lochry and his men was a cruel blow to Clark. Kentucky settlers were waiting *See post, 430 et seq. See Alvord, Kaskaskia Records (I. H.

Of the two routes which seemed open for an expedition, that by the Miami against the Shawnee and Delaware or up the Wabash, Clark preferred the latter.

He saw in this expedition, if successful, the possibility of carrying his operations against Detroit. “I wait as a Spectator,” he said, “to see what a Country is determined to do for itself when reduced to a State of Desperation; I am ready to lead you on to any Action that has the most distant pros- pect of Advantage, however daring it may appear to be. . . . .

In keeping with the recommendation of the assem- bly, they advised the construction of forts at intervals along the Ohio, and especially one at the mouth of the Kentucky, which should be well garrisoned. They objected to maintaining the chief fort at the falls, since by so doing their strength would be needlessly divided, and opposed Clark's statement that it was a post of first importance. “To say that the Falls is the ‘Key *See post, 598.

It is a strong rapid which may in an age of commerce be a considerable obstruction to the navigation, but as we have no Trade we neither need nor have any keys to Trade.” They assumed that the fort which they advocated would be constructed and garrisoned by regular soldiers. But when it was ascertained that these burdens were to be borne by themselves they refused to acquiesce, giving as their reasons, the necessity of securing their crops; the want of money and intrenching tools; and constant fear of attacks by the Indians which necessitated the militia remaining at home.” In a council of the officers of the department held the next day, it was agreed that an expedition which would consist of only seven hundred men, the number of regulars and militia available, was impracticable. While insisting that the garrison at the falls should be maintained, they likewise recommended that a fort should be built at the mouth of the Kentucky and urged the assembling of a strong force for the reduction of Detroit the next spring. British officials were now giving greater attention to border affairs. Savage favor was maintained through the expenditure of larger sums for presents.” A con- tinuous succession of attacks by small parties kept the frontier inhabitants from Illinois to New York in *Cal. of Va.

Even while Clark was in council with his officers, Brant and McKee were, as already related, marching towards Louisville with their victorious savages. Refusing to attack Clark, two hundred Mingo and Huron were with great difficulty kept together and led southward in order to “attack some of the Kentucky forts or infest the roads.” Besides the constant fear from the Shawnee and other tribes north of the Ohio, reports were general that an attack on Kentucky by the Cherokee and Creeks was soon to be expected. The spirit of general despondency was portrayed by Colonel Floyd in the following letter: “The frontier of this County along the Ohio River is 277 miles by computation and the Inhabitants greatly dispersed & cooped up in small forts without any ammunition. The most distressed widows & Orphans perhaps in the world make up a great part of our Inhabitants.” Numerous appeals were made to the Virginia authorities for assistance. A thousand men, in ad- dition to the available militia, would be able, they were informed, not only to Secure Kentucky, but at the same time offer protection to the other back settle- ments.

Clark still advocated an expedition up the Wabash against the Indian nations among whom the English power was most strongly intrenched. He saw in such a movement, if successful, the capture of Detroit, control of the savages and preservation of the Ken- tucky settlements, retention of power over “the Illinois both Spanish and American” and ultimate influence on the terms of peace. It is probable he had in his possession at the time the message from Colonel Arthur Campbell written nearly a month before in which he stated that peace would probably be declared within a few months. “I wish,” he wrote, “we could carry our arms to the banks of Lake Erie, before a cessation would take place. . . . . altho' every true Ameri- can must acknowledge, the advantages that would accrue, could Canada be added to the Union."

Durrett.] - June 17, '98 DEAR SIR Your letter of last month honored by Mr. Thurston, was handed me by that gentleman. The matter contained in it and in the inclosed papers was new to me. I felt hurt that Mr. Jefferson should be attacked with so much virulence on account of an error of which I know he was not the author. Ex- Cept a few mistakes in names of persons, places, etc., the story of Logan, as related by Mr. Jefferson, is substantially true. I was of the first and last of the active officers who bore the weight of *Clark was then returning after his service as a volunteer captain in Dun- more's War. See Introduction, ante, liii. *Whether this is the original letter could not be ascertained. The evidence seems to favor the statement that it is a copy. Colonel Durrett, in answer to my letter of inquiry, wrote as follows: “I have had doubts myself about the letter which I have being the original written by Clark for reasons similar to thºse which you state in your letter of inquiry to me. I received this letter frºm a brother of Leonard Bliss, who was killed by Godfrey Pope in 1842, with some other matters, F. and manuscript, which he had received from his brother's estate after his death. I knew that Leonard Bliss had valuable papers which referred to General Clark and therefore was glad to purchase from his brother a copy of the Louisville News Letter and this manuscript letter of General Clark and some other papers which apparently came straight and were genuine.”

4 ILLINOIS HISTORICAL COLLECTIONS that war; and on perusing some old papers of that date, I find some memoirs. But independent of them, I have a perfect recollection of every transaction relating to Logan's story." The * Logan, whose Indian name was Tah-gah-jute, was a noted Mingo chief. His father was French but, when a boy, was captured by the Indians and be- came an influential chief of the Cayuga. Logan's mother was of this tribe. Logan took no part in the French and Indian War. For a number of years he lived in western Pennsylvania and, about 1772, moved to a Mingo village located on Tetlow Creek. Among the pioneers, he was noted for his sobriety, honesty and friendship for white men. In later life he drank to excess and is said to have become ferocious towards everyone. He met his death, in 1780, at the hand of one of his relatives. The incidents related in the letter by Clark, probably led to the immediate outbreak of Dunmore's War. In his Notes on Virginia, written in 1781 (p. 67), Thomas Jefferson attributed the murder of Logan's family to Michael Cresap. This was the view commonly held by those persons who were sup: posed to know the circumstances. (See Notes on Virginia. Appendix IV.) It was generally believed also that Logan gave the substance of the famous speech, quoted by Mr. Jefferson, when he was invited to the conference after the battle of Point Pleasant, by a special messenger sent by Lord Dunmore. The speech is as follows: “I appeal to any white man to say if ever he entered Logan's cabin hungry, and he gave him not meat; if ever he came cold and naked, and he clothed him not. During the course of the last long and bloody war, Logan remained quiet in his cabin, an advocate for peace. Such was my love for the whites, that my countrymen as they passed, said, “Logan is the friend of white men.' I had even thought to live with you, but for the injuries of one man, Col. Cresap, the last Spring, in cold blood and unprovoked, murdered all the relations of Logan, not sparing even my women and children. There runs not a drop of my blood in the veins of any living creature. This called on me for revenge. I have sought it: I have killed many: I have fully glutted my vengeance. For my country, I rejoice at the beams of peace. But do not harbor a thought that mine is the joy of fear. Logan never felt fear. He will not turn on his heel to save his life. Who is there to mourn for Logan? Not one.” Luther Martin, a son-in-law of Cresap, in a published letter, 1797, pro- nounced the speech not genuine and the statement made about Captain Cresap without foundation. A controversy followed, and Jefferson made a careful investigation of the facts. This was the origin of Clark's letter. It is probable that the letter, or a copy, was in Jefferson's possession, and it is difficult to understand why he did not incorporate it along with others in the new edition of his Notes on Virginia, 1800 (Appendix). Samuel Brown, of Lexington, Kentucky, in a letter to Mr. Jefferson, September 4, 1798, wrote as follows: “I have deferred replying to your friendly letter hitherto from an expectation of collecting from different sources a variety of statements and facts relative to the murder of Logan's family. . . . I am happy in having it in my power to transmit to you an interesting letter from your friend, General Clark, which, indeed, appears to me to render further investi- gation quite unnecessary. The only point for which you contend, viz., that Logan is really the author of the speech ascribed to him in your Notes on Virginia, is now established beyond the possibility of contradiction. The incidents in Gen. Clark's narration follow each other in a manner so simple and so natural as to afford every liberal and candid inquirer the highest internal evidence of their reality.” (Draper MSS., 16S83 et seq.) The account given by Clark in which he asserts that Greathouse and not Cresap was the author of the barbarous act which gave rise to Logan's speech,
Page 5
CLARK TO BROWN, JUNE 17, 1798 5 conduct of Cresap I am perfectly acquainted with." He was not the author of that murder, but a family by the name of Greathouse through some transaction that happened under the command of Capt. Cresap a few days previous to the murder of Logan's family gave him sufficient ground to suppose that it was Cresap that had done the injury. To enable you fully to understand the subject of your inquiries, I shall relate the incidents that gave rise to Lo- gan's suspicion and will enable Mr. Jefferson to do justice to himself and the Cresap family by being made fully acquainted with facts. This country was explored in 1773. A resolution was formed to make a settlement the spring following, and the mouth of the Little Kenaway [sic] was appointed the place of general rendezvous in order to descend the river from thence in a body. Early in the spring the Indians had done some mischief. Reports from their towns were alarming which deterred many. About eighty or ninety men only set out at the appointed rendezvous where we lay Some days. A small party of hunters that lay about ten miles below us, were fired upon by the Indians, whom the hunters beat back and returned to camp.” This and many other circumstances led us to believe that the Indians were determined on war. The whole party was enrolled and determined to execute their project of forming a settlement in Kentucky, as we had every necessary is now accepted as trustworthy. See Thwaites and Kellogg, Dunmore's War, 9 et seq. For Luther Martin's letter and a complete account of the evidence, see Craig, The Olden Time, II., 51 et seq. *Michael Cresap was the son of Thomas Cresap who came to the colonies from Yorkshire, England, on account of oppression under James II. Thomas Cresap became an Indian trader and surveyor in Maryland, and acquired land ºn the upper Potomac. He was a leading man in the Ohio Company, and a friend of Washington. Michael Cresap was born in 1742, and early became an Indian trader. At the outbreak of Dunmore's War, he was commissioned captain and served until the end of the campaign. In July of the following year, having raised a company of one hundred and thirty riflemen in Mary- land, he led them eight hundred miles and joined Washington at Cambridge. He died in New York City, October, 1775. For a good account of the Cresap family, see Ohio Arch. and Hist. Soc., Publications, x., 146 et seq. An appre- siative sketch of Colonel Thomas Cresap is found in Darlington, Christopher Gist's Journals, 202 et seq. *Thwaites and Kellogg, Dunmore's War, 115. The Indians made an at- tack on thirteen people who were planning to locate on the Qhio. Three In- dians were killed by the whites and this is said to have led to the determi- nation of the Shawnee to rob the Pennsylvanians and kill the Virginians wherever they were found. The account gives an excellent description of the widespread interest in western lands and methods of securing them.

6 ILLIN() IS HISTORICAL COLLECTIONS store that could be thought of. An Indian town called Horse- head Bottom on the Sciota and near its mouth, lay nearly in our way. The determination was to cross the country and surprise it. Who was to command was the question. There were but few among us that had experience in Indian warfare and they were such as we did not choose to be commanded by. We knew of Capt. Cresap being on the river about fifteen miles above us with some hands settling a plantation; and that he had concluded to follow us to Kentucky as soon as he had fixed there his people. We also know that he had been experienced in a former war. He was proposed; and it was unanimously agreed to send for him to command the party. Messengers were despatched and in half an hour returned with Cresap. He had heard of our resolution by some of his hunters that had fallen in with ours, and had set out to come to us. We now thought our army, as we called it, com- plete, and the destruction of the Indians sure. A council was called and to our astonishment, our intended commander-in-chief was the person that dissauded us from the enterprise. He said, that appearances were very suspicious, but there was no certainty of a war. That if we made the attempt proposed, he had no doubt of our success but a war would at any rate be the result, and that we should be blamed for it, and perhaps justly. But if we were determined to proceed, he would lay aside all consider- ations, send to his camp for his people and share our fortunes. He was then asked what he would advise. His answer was that we should return to Wheeling, as a convenient post, to hear what was going forward. That a few weeks would determine. As it was early in the spring, if we found the Indians were not disposed for war, we should have full time to return and make our establish- ment in Kentucky. This was adopted, and in two hours the whole were under way. As we ascended the river we met Kill-buck, an Indian chief with a small party. We had a long conference with him, but received but little satisfaction as to the disposition of the Indians. It was observed that Cresap did not come to this con- ference, but kept on the opposite side of the river. He said he was afraid to trust himself with the Indians. That Kill-buck had frequently attempted to way-lay his father to kill him— that if he crossed the river, 1.erhaps, his fortitude might fail him
Page 7
CLARK TO BROWN, JUNE 17, 1798 7 and he might put Kill-buck to death. On our arrival at Wheeling (the country being pretty well settled thereabouts) the whole of the inhabitants appeared to be alarmed. They flocked to our camp from every direction and all we could say would not keep them from under our wings. We offered to cover their neighbor- hood with scouts, until further information, if they would return to their plantations, but nothing would avail. By this time we had got to be a formidable party. All the hunters, men without families, etc., in that quarter had joined our party. Our arrival at Wheeling was soon known at Pittsburg. The whole of that country, at that time, being under the jurisdiction of Virginia, Dr. Connolly had been appointed by Dunmore, Capt. Comman- dant of the district which was called Waugusta [[West Augusta). He, learning of us sent a message addressed to the party let- ting us know that a war was to be apprehended and requesting that we would keep our position for a few days, as messages had been sent to the Indians, and a few days would determine the doubt. The answer he got was that we had no inclination to quit our quar- ters for sometime. That during our stay we should be careful that the enemy should not harass the neighborhood that we lay in. But before this answer could reach Pittsburg, he sent a second express, addressed to Capt. Cresap, as the most influential man among us, informing him that the message had returned from the Indians that war was inevitable, and begging him to use his influ- ence with the party to get them to cover the country by scouts until the inhabitants could fortify themselves. The reception of this letter was the epoch of open hostilities with the Indians. A new post was planted, a council was called and the letter read by Cresap. All the Indian traders being summoned on so important an occasion, action was had and war declared in the most solemn manner; and the same evening two scalps were brought into camp. The next day some canoes of Indians were discovered on the river keeping the advantage of the island to cover themselves from our view. They were chased fifteen miles down the river and driven ashore. A battle ensued, a few were wounded on both sides, one Indian only taken prisoner. On examining their canoes, we found a considerable quantity of ammunition and other warlike stores. On our return to camp, a resolution was adopted to march the
Page 8
8 ILLINOIS HISTORICAL COLLECTIONS next day and attack Logan's camp on the Ohio about thirty miles above us. We did march about five miles and then halted to take some refreshment. Here the impropriety of executing the projec- ted enterprise was argued. The conversation was brought for- ward by Cresap himself. It was generally agreed that those Indians had no hostile intentions as they were hunting, and their party was composed of men, women and children with all their stuff with them. This we knew as I myself and others present had been in the camp about four weeks past on our descending the river from Pittsburg. In short, every person seemed to detest the resolution we had set out with. We returned in the evening, de- camped and took the road to Redstone. It was two days after this that Logan's family were killed and from the manner in which it was done, it was viewed as a horrid murder. From Logan hearing of Cresap being at the head of the party on the river, it is no wonder that he supposed he had a hand in the destruction of his family. Since the reception of your letter, I have procured the “Notes on Virginia.” They are now before me. The act was more barbarous than related by Mr. Jefferson. Those Indians used to visit and return visits with the neighboring whites on the opposite side of the river. They were on a visit to a family by the name of Grcathouse at the time they were murdered by them and their associates. The war now raged in all its savage fury, until the fall, when a treaty of peace was held at Camp Charlotte, within four miles of Chillicothe, the Indian capital on the Ohio. Logan did not appear. I was acquainted with him and wished to know the reason. The answer was “that he was like a mad dog, his bristles were up and were not quite fallen, but the good talk now going forward might allay them.” Logan's speech to Dun- more now came forward, as related by Mr. Jefferson. It was thought to be clever although the army knew it to be wrong as to Cresap. But it only produced a laugh in camp. I saw it dis- pleased Capt. Cresap and told him “that he must be a very great man, that the Indians palmed everything that happened on his shoulders.” He smiled and said that he had an inclination to tomahawk Greathouse for the murder. What I have here related is fact I was intimate with Cresap. Logan I was better acquainted with, at that time, than any other Indian in the Western country.

'Richard Henderson was born in Virginia but, as a boy of ten years, re- moved with his parents to Granville County in western North Carolina. His father was a sheriff; and Richard, when he reached the proper age, was made under-sheriff. His education was meager, but having procured some law books after a few months of study he was permitted to practice. He quickly rose to favor and was known as a man of influence and wealth. In 1768, he was appointed a judge in the North Carolina Superior Court. Trouble arose on account of the regulators, his court-room was invaded by the mob and his house and other property were destroyed. He was ambitious to found a proprietary colony west of the Alleghenies and organized a company con- sisting of men from North Carolina, known as the Transylvania Company. At the treaty of Sycamore Shoals (Watauga) early in 1775, Henderson se- cured the control of lands between the Ohio, Kentucky and Cumberland rivers, and a settlement was made at Boonesborough. . By December 1 of that year five hundred and sixty thousand acres of land were entered. The Transylvania Company exercised control over this land until the close of 1778. The Virginia assembly declared the Cherokee purchase void, but to reimburse Henderson and Company granted them the title to some two hun- dred thousand acres of land on the Ohio and Green rivers.

12 I LLINOIS HISTORICAL COLLECTIONS And in the year following, after the country had been discovered and explored, many more became adventurers, some of whom claimed lands by virtue of warrants, granted by Lord Dunmore, agreeable to the Royal Proclamation in the year 1763, and others by pre-occupancy, agreeably to the entry laws of Virginia. And in the meantime a company of men from North Carolina pur- chased, or pretended to purchase, from the Cherokee Indians, all that tract of land from the southern most waters of Cumberland River to the banks of Louisa or Kentucke river, including also the lands on which inhabitants live in Powell's Valley. By virtue of which purchase they stile themselves the true and absolute proprietors of the New Independent Province (as they call Transyl- vania) they are endeavoring to erect, and in consequence of their usurped authority, officers both civil and military are appointed, writs of election issued, Assemblies convened, a land office opened, conveyances made, lands sold at an exhorbitant price, and a system of policy introduced which does not at all harmonize with that lately adopted by the United Colonies; but on the contrary, for aught yet appears, this fertile country will afford a safe asylum to those whose principles are inimical to American Freedom. But your petitioners have the greatest reason to question the validity of those men's purchase, being well informed that the Cherokees never extended their claims north of Cumberland River, nor would warrant any lands on the other side. Besides, it is now well known. that the Indians of the Six Nations claimed & ceded those very lands to the Crown of Great Britain at a treaty held at Fort Stanwix in November, 1768. We, therefore, are not willing to obey those, or the authority they have assumed, or indeed, to acknowledge any power or prerog- ative which is not derived from the Convention of Virginia, whose subjects we desire to be considered. Virginia, we conceive, can claim this country with the greatest justice and propriety; it is within the limits of their charter; they fought and bled for it, and had it not been for the memorable battle at the Great Kanaway, those vast regions had yet continued inaccessible. Nor can we conceive how it is practicable for those men who stile themselves absolute proprietors to settle this country at so great a distance from all the Colonies, and in the neighborhood of some enemy

But should our infant settlement become the object of your deliberations, and be taken under your protection and direc- tion, unto whom we justly conceive that we belong, every obstacle would be removed, population increase, and of consequence a barrier to the interior parts of Virginia from the Indians. A new source of wealth would then be opened, as trade and navigation under the auspices of Virginia would flourish in this western world. And therefore, willing to acquit our conscience, and not entail slavery upon our posterity by submitting to the pretentions and impositions of the pretended Proprietors, we the inhabitants of the north and the south sides of Kentucke river. having assembled together after preparatory notice on the eighth day of June, 1776, and continued to poll till the 15" of the said instant, in order to elect two gentlemen to serve for us in Convention, and by a major- ity have chosen Captain John Gabriel Jones and Captain George Rogers Clark, and hope your Honorable the Convention will receive them as our delegates from this the western parts of Fincastle county. And as we sincerely concur in the measures established by the Continental Congress & Colony of Virginia; and willing to the utmost of our abilities to support the present laudable cause by raising our quota of men, and bear a proportionable share of the expense that will necessarily accrue in the support of our common liberty. And that good order may be observed, we proceeded to elect a Committee consisting of twenty-one members, as is already done in West Augusta, and which precedent we rely upon to justify our proceedings to the world; for without law or authority, vice here could take its full scope, having no laws to restrain, or power to control. Upon the whole, we cheerfully submit to the authority and jurisdiction of this House, not doubting but you will take us under your protection, and give us such directions by our representatives as you, in your great wisdom, may think best.

Chairman, John Bowman, John Cowen, William Bennet, Joseph Bowman, John Crittenden, Isaac Hite, George Rogers Clark, Silas Harlan, Hugh McGary, Andrew McConnell, James Harrod, William McConnell, and John Maxwell, gent". The inhabitants of this frontier part of Virginia, who are equally desirous of contributing to the utmost of their power to the support of the present laudable cause of American Freedom, and willing to convince and to prove to the world, that tho' they live so remote from the seat of Government, that they feel in the most sensible manner for their suffering brethren, and that they most ardently desire to be looked upon as a part of this Colony, not- withstanding the base proceedings of a detestable, wicked and corrupt Ministry, to prevent any more counties to be laid off, without the inhabitants would be so pusillanimous as to give up their right of appointing proper persons to represent them (in Assembly) or in Convention: And as we further conceive, that as the Proclamation of his Majesty for not settling on the western parts of this Colony, is not founded upon law, it cannot have any force, and if we submit to that Proclamation, and continue not to lay off new counties on the frontiers that they may send represem- tatives to the Convention, it is leaving an opening to the wicked and diabolical designs of the Ministry, as then this immense and fertile country would afford an assylum to those whose principles are inimical to American Liberty. And if new counties are mov laid off, as Fincastle County now reaches and already settled up- wards of three hundred miles from East to west, it is impossible that two delegates can be sufficient to represent such a respectable body of people, or that such a number of inhabitants should be bound to obey without being heard; and as those very people would most cheerfully co-operate in every measure tending to the public peace and American Freedom, they have delegated two gentlemen, who were chosen by the free voice of the people, and which election was held for eight days at Harrodsburg (on the western waters of Fincastle or Kentucke) after the preparatory notice of five weeks

John Gabriel Jones and Captain George Rogers Clark having the majority, were chosen; and not doubting the acceptance of them as our representatives by the Honorable the Convention, to serve in that capacity, as we conceive the precedent established in West Augusta will justify our proceedings. And we cannot but observe how impolitic it would be to suffer such a respectable body of prime riflemen to remain even in a state of neutrality, when at this time a certain set of men from North Carolina, stiling them- selves Proprietors, & claiming an absolute right to these very lands, taking upon themselves the Legislative authority, commis- sioning officers both civil and military, having also opened a Land Office, Surveyors General & deputies appointed and act, convey- ances made, and land sold at an exhorbitant price, with many other unconstitutional practices, tending to disturb the minds of those who are well-disposed to the wholesome Government of Virginia, and creating factions and divisions amongst ourselves, as we have not hitherto been represented in Convention. And as at this time of general danger, we cannot take too much precaution to prevent the inroads of the savages, & prevent the effusion of innocent blood, we, the Committee, after receiving a message from the chiefs of the Delawares who are now settled near the mouth of the Waubash, informing us that a treaty was to be held at O'Post' by the English and Kickapoo Indians, and that they would attend to know the purport of the same, and if their brothers, the Long Knives would send a man they could rely on, they would, on their return, inform him of the same, as they were apprehensive the Kickapoos would strike their brothers, the Long Knives. Therefore, we thought it most prudent, and shall send immediately a certain James Harrod and Garret Pendergrass to converse with them on the same. And as it is the request of the inhabitants that we should point out a number of men capable and most acquainted with the laws of this Colony to act as civil Magistrates, a list of the same we have enclosed; and for other matters relative to this country, we con- ceive that Captain Jones and Captain Clark, our delegates, will ‘O'Post: commonly written Opost, was the “poste du Ouabache” of the French- For the first time, in 1752, it was called Post Vincennes.

[Draper MSS., 48J13.—Copy.] SIR- According to promise I haste to give you a description of the town of Kuskuskies, and my plan for taking of it. It is situated 30 leagues above the mouth of the Ohio, on a river of its own name, five miles from its mouth and two miles east of the Missis- sippi. On the west side of the Mississippi 3 miles from Kuskus- kies is the village of Mozier [Misere = Ste. Genevieve] belonging to the Spaniards. The town of Kuskuskies contains about one hundred families of French and English and carry on an extensive trade with the Indians; and they have a considerable number of negroes that bear arms and are chiefly employed in managing their farms that lay around the town, and send a considerable quantity of flour and other commodities to New Orleans, [which they barter every year and get the return in goods up the Mississippi].” The houses are framed and very good, with a small but elegant stone fort situated [but a little distance from] the centre of the town. The Mississippi is undermining a part of Fort Chartress; the garrison was removed to this place, which greatly added to its wealth; but on the commencement of the present war, the troops [were] called off to re-inforce Detroit, * In a note preceding this letter, Dr. Draper says: “Copy of an old and much decayed letter of Genl. G. R. Clark, written plainly in the summer or fall of 1777, and very likely addressed to Gov. Patrick Henry. It is trans- cribed as full as could be done—as the original has been wet, and is much worn and faded.” Draper has supplied context in brackets. Clark communicated his views to Governor Henry relative to an expedi- tion on December 10. See Diary and Memoir. It is probable, therefore, that the contents of this letter formed the foundation for their discussion. The letter has been published by Turner in the Amer. Hist. Rev., viii., 491 et seq. *Draper marks this as “erased.”

CLARK TO HENRY, 1777 31 which is about three hundred miles from it—leaving the fort and all its stores in care of one Roseblack [sic] as comdº of the place, with instructions to influence as many Indians as possible to invade the Colonies; and to supply Detroit with provisions, a considerable quantity of which goes by the way of the Waubash R., and have but a short land carriage to the waters of ye [Miami] In June last I sent two young men there: They [Rocheblave and the French] seemed to be under no apprehension of danger from the Americans]' The fort, which stands a small distance below the town is built of stockading about ten feet high, with blockhouses at each corner, with several pieces of cannon mounted—[10,000 lbs' powder, ball and all other necessary stores without [any] guard or a single soldier. Roseblock who acted as Governor, by large presents engaged the Waubash Indians to invade the frontiers of Kentucky; was daily treating with other Nations, giving large presents and offering them great rewards for scalps. The principal inhabitants are entirely against the American cause, and look on us as notorious rebels that ought to be subdued at any rate; but I dont doubt but after being acquainted with the cause they would become good friends to it. The remote situation of this town on the back of several of the Western Nations; their being well supplied with goods on the Mississippi, enables them to carry]* to furnish the different Nations [with goods],” and by presents will keep up a strict friendship with the Indians; and un- doubtedly will keep all the Nations that lay under their influence at war with us during the present contest, without they are induced to submission; [that being situated above the mouth of the Ohio]” they will be able to interrupt any communication that we should want to hold up and down the Mississippi, without a strong guard; having plenty of swivels they might, and I dont doubt but would keep armed boats for the purpose of taking our property. On the contrary, if it was in our possession it would distress the garrison at Detroit for provisions, it would fling the command of the two great rivers into our hands, which would * For a discussion of the previous relations between the merchants of the Illinois villages and the settlers in Kentucky, consult Alvord, Kaskaskia Records (I.

ORDER OF COUNCIL, JANUARY 2, 1778 33 ORDER OF Council, January 2, 1778." |Henry, Life, Correspondence and Speeches of Patrick Henry, I., 584.) Friday, Jany 2, 1778. Present, His Excellency, John Page, Dudley Digges, John Blair, Nathaniel Harrison and David Jameson, Esquires. The Governor informed the Council that he had had some con- versation with several Gentlemen who were well acquainted with the Western Frontiers of Virginia, & the situation of the post at Kaskasky held by the British King's Forces, where there are many pieces of cannon, & military stores to a considerable amount; & that he was informed the place was at present held by a very weak garrison, which induced him to believe that an expedition against it might be carried on with success, but that he wished the advice of the Council on the occasion. Whereupon they advised his Excellency to set on foot the ex- pedition against Kaskasky with as little delay & as much Secrecy as possible, & for the purpose to issue his warrant upon the Treasurer for twelve hundred pounds payable to Col. George Rogers Clark, who is willing to undertake the service, he giving bond & security faithfully to account for the same. And the Council further advised the Governor to draw up proper in- structions for Colonel Clark. His Excellency having prepared the instructions accordingly, the same were read, [and] approved of . . . . . ‘This action of the privy council was approved by the general assembly which authorized the governor with the advice of the privy council to organ- tºe an expedition, “to march against and attack any of our said enemies, . . . . and give the necessary orders for the expedition.” Hening, Statutes at Large, Ix., 375.

I wish I had known of his being acquainted with all the places you are going to. He is intimately acquainted in all that Country having been often times through every place there & can give you valuable Intelligence & Advice. I wish you to avail yourself of his Counsel & proceed as you find the Interest of your Country directs when you get to the place you are going to. What I have in View is that your Operations should not be confin'd to the Fort & the Settlement at the place mention'd in your secret Instructions, but that you proceed to the Enemy's Settlements above or across, as you may find it proper. Colo Rogers will be in Danger as he comes up the River Home- wards unless he can fall in with your party & return with them. * Colonel David Rogers, accompanied by twenty-cight men, was sent to New Orleans with special dispatches to the Spanish governor. He was ordered to bring to Fort Pitt goods which it was expected would be assigned to Virginia by Governor Galvez. Two boat-loads of goods were secured. At the Falls of the Ohio, Colonel Rogers received a re-enforcement of men sent by Clark. Upon reaching a #;" a little above the mouth of the Licking they were attacked, October 4, 1779, by a large force of Indians. Thirteen men only, of the seventy in the company, escaped. (See Memoir, post, 302. For a complete account, see Butler, Hist. of Kentucky, 102 et seq.) Colonel Rogers was born in Ireland. He came as a youth to America and settled at Oldtown, Md., where he became a merchant. In 1775, he founded a settlement on the Ohio, five miles above Wheeling. He was a member of the Virginia legisla- ture in 1776, was re-elected the following year, and was appointed county- lieutenant of Ohio County in 1777. -

[Draper MSS., 14S128.—Copy.] WMSBURG, Novr 16th 1778. GENTLEMEN: The Executive power of this State having been impressed with a strong apprehension of incursions on their frontier settlements from the savages situated about the Illinois, and supposing the danger would be greatly obviated by an enterprise against the English posts and possessions in that country, which were well known to inspire the savages with their bloody purposes against us sent a detachment of militia, consisting of one hundred and seventy or eighty men, commanded by Col. George Rogers Clark on that service some time last spring. By despatches which I have just received from Col. Clark it appears that his success has equalled the most sanguine expectations.” He has not only re- duced Fort Chartres and its dependencies, but has struck such a terror into the Indian tribes between that settlement & the Lakes that no less than five of them, viz: the Puans, Sacks, Renards, Powtowautanies, & Miamies, who had received the hatchet from the English emissaries, have submitted to our arms all their English presents, and bound themselves by treaties and promises to be peaceable in future. The Great Blackbird, a Chippewa Chief, has also sent a belt of peace to Col. Clark, influenced, he supposes, by the dread of Detroit's being reduced by the American arms. This latter place * Printed also in English, Conquest of the Northwest, I., 245 et seq. * It has not been possible to locate the originals of these letters but it seems evident that Governor Henry followed the contents in this report to Congress.

I want the Spanish Blood, & the Mares to be large as you can get, & not old.

I should like very much to receive one of the Stallions Time enough to cover next Spring. I beg you to try to accomplish it. Perhaps you may send both by that Time, but if you can't do that, let them be sent by the most carefull people as soon as they are procured. I expect the Mares immediately, because they need not be picked with the Care to be used in finding out the finest Horses.

For detached from the Body of your Country, placed among French Spaniards & Indian Nations strangers to our people, anxiously watching your actions & Behaviour, & ready to receive Impressions favourable, or not so, of our Commonwealth & its Government. which Impressions will be hard to remove & wil produce lasting good or ill Effects to your Country; These Considerations will make you cautious & Circumspect.

INSTRUCTIONS TO CLARK, DECEMBER 12, 1778 81 to the Commonwealth. The Advice & Assistance of good discreet men will be highly necessary. For at the Distance of your County, I can not be consulted. General Discretionary powers therefore are given you to act for the best in all Cases where these Instructions are silent, & the Law has made no provision. I desire Your particular attention to Mrs. Rocheblare and her Children, and that you suffer them to want for nothing. Let Mr. Rocheblare's property which was taken be restored to his Lady so far as it can be done. You have the Sum of Sixty pounds sent for her use, in case you can't find her husbands Effects to restore. Prudence requires that provisions be laid in to subsist the Troops you have & those to be expected to arrive with you. Colonel Bowman has contracted to deliver 35,000 lb Bear Bacon at Kentucky, but Bread must be had at Illinois. You will pro- vide it if possible before the arrival of the Troops, or the necessity to buy it becomes general known, as perhaps Advantages may be taken by raising the price. Lay up also a good Stock of powder & Lead. There is a Cargoe of Goods at a Spanish post near you belong- ing either to the Continent or this State. Rather than let your Troops be naked, you are to take a supply for them out of these Goods. But this is not to be done but in Case of absolute Neces- sity. Let an exact account be kept of what is used & let me receive it. In your Negotiations or Treatys with the Indians, you will be sisted by Mr. Todd. Let the Treatys be confined to the Sub- ject of Amity & peace with our people, and not to touch the Sub- jects of Lands. You may accept of any Services they offer, for Expelling the English from Detroit or elsewhere. In case you find presents to the savages necessary, make them sparingly as possible, letting them know our Stock of Goods is small at present, ºut by means of our Trade with the french & other Nations we expect plenty of Goods before it is long. Lieutenant Colonel Montgomery will convey to you ten thou- ‘and pounds for payment of the Troops & for other Matters

State Archives.—Copy.] Decr. 12, 1778. You are forthwith to put on Foot the recruiting of men to reinforce Colo Clarke at the Ilinois and to push it on with all possible expedition, As soon as the number of one hundred can be collected let them be sent on under the proper Officers & join Colonel Clarke. If you think that number too small to go in safety add to it til you Judge the number large enough to resist the attacks that may be expected from the Indians. You will cause the proper vessels for transporting the Troops down the Cherokee River to be built & ready before they are wanted Let no time be lost in doing that. Mr James Buchanan you must direct to lay in the provision necessary. You will get powder & flint from Colo Flemings and Lead from the Mines sufficient ſº the use of the parties on the march. Blank Commissions for the Officers of five Companies are delivered you to be fill'd up as the numbers of men they recruit shall intitle them as to date and Rank. If any Officer who is intrusted to recruit shall fail to inlist and pro- duce his quota in a reasonable time Such as the exigance & press- ing necessity to releive & secure the Ilinois Country do require in that case the Officer so failing is to give up the men he has inlisted together with his recruiting instructions to you, or to such other person as you may appoint to Succeed him, And if the person you appoint to Succeed him fails in due time to inlist and produce the quota for which he undertakes to recruit, you are to make a new appointment, til every quota is full or so near full as to be fit

INSTRUCTIONS FROM HENRY TO TODD S3 tº march. You are to take especial care to appoint men proper to be Officers and as this matter from the necessity of the Case is intrusted to you an improper appointment will reflect great dis- hºnor upon you. As soon as the state of Affairs in the recruiting business will permit you are to go to the Ilinois Country and join Coº Clarke. I need not tell you how necessary the greatest possible dispatch is to the good of the service in which you are tigaged Our party at Ilinois may be lost together with the present favorable disposition of the French & Indians there unless tºtry moment is improved for their preservation & no future ºppºrtunity if the present is lost can ever be expected so favorable to the interest of the Commonwealth. I therefore urge it on you to exert yourself to the utmost to lose not a moment to forward the great work you have in hand & to conquer every difficulty in your way arising from an inclement season, great distances, Want of many necessaries, opposition from enemies & others I ºnt enumerate, but must confide in your virtue to guard against and surmount.

S4 ILLINOIS HISTORICAL COLLECTIONS Commandant there. And for . . . . of your conduct I refer you to the law. The grand objects which are disclosed to the view of your Coun- trymen will prove beneficial or otherwise according to the Virtue and Abilities of those who are called to direct the Affairs of that remote Country. The present crisis rendered so favourable by the good disposition of the French and Indians may be improved to great purposes: But if unhappily it should be lost, a return of the same attachments to us may never happen. Considering there- fore that early prejudices are so hard to wear out you will take care to cultivate and conciliate the affections of the French and Indians. Although great reliance is placed on your prudence in managing the people you are to reside among; yet considering you as unac- quainted in some degree with their genius usuages and manners as well as the geography of the Country I recommend it to you to consult and advise with the most intelligent and upright persons who may fall in your way. You are to give particular attention to Col Clarke and his corps to whom the State has great obligations. You are to co-operate with him in any military undertaking when necessary and to give the military every aid which the circumstances of the people will admit of. The Inhabitants of Illinois must not expect settled peace and safety while their and our Enemies have footing at Detroit and can interrupt or stop the Trade of the Mississippi. If the English have not the strength or courage to come to War against us themselves, their practice has been and will be to hire the Savages to commit murder and depredations. Illinois must expect to pay in these a large price for her Freedom, unless the English can be expelled from Detroit The means of effecting this will not perhaps be found in your or Col Clarkes power. But the French inhabiting the neighbourhood of that place, it is pre- sumed may be brought to see it done with indifference or per- haps join in the enterprise with pleasure. This is but conjecture. When you are on the spot you and Col Clarke may discover its fallacy or reality. If the former appears, defence only is to be the object. If the latter or a good prospect of it, I hope the French-
Page 85
INSTRUCTIONS FROM HENRY TO TODD S5 men and Indians at your disposal will shew a Zeal for the affair equal to the benefits to be derived from established liberty and permanent peace. One great good expected from holding the Illinois is to over- awe the Indians from warring on our Settlers on this Side Ohio. A close attention to the disposition character and movements of the hostile Tribes is therefore necessary for you. The Forces and Militia at Illinois by being placed on the back of them may inflict timely chastisment on these Enemies whose Towns are an easy prey in the absence of their Warriors. You percieve by these hints that something in the military line may be expected from you. So far as the occasion calls for the assistance of the people composing the Militia it will be necessary to co-operate with the Troops sent from hence. And I know of no better general direction to give than this, that you consider your- Self as at the Head of the Civil department and as such having the Command of the Militia, who are not to be under the Command of the Military until ordered out by the Civil Authority and act in conjunction with them. You are on all occasions to inculcate on the people the value of liberty and the difference between the State of free Citizens of this Commonwealth and that Slavery to which Illinois was destined A free and equal representation may be expected by them in a little time together with all the improvements in Jurisprudence and police which the other parts of the State enjoy. It is necessary for the happiness increase and prosperity of that Country that the grievances which obstruct these blessings be known in order to their removal. Let it therefore be your care to obtain information on that subject that proper plans may be formed for the general Utility. Let it be your constant attention to see that the Inhabitants have Justice administred to them for any Injury received from the Troops. The omission of this may be fatal. Col Clarke has instructions on this head and will I doubt not exert himself to curb all licentious practices of the Soldiery, which if unrestrained will produce the most baneful effects. You will also discountenance and punish every attempt to violate the property of the Indians, particularly in their lands.
Page 86
S6 ILLINOIS HISTORICAL COLLECTIONS Our Enemy's have alarmed them much on that score. But I hope from your prudence and Justice that no ground of complaint will be administred on the subject. You will embrace every opportunity to manifest the high regard and friendly sentiments of this Commonwealth towards all the subjects of his Catholic Majesty, for whose safety prosperity and advantage you will give every possible advantage You will make a tender of the Friendship and services of your people to the Spanish Commandant near Kaskaskias & cultivate the strictest connection with him and his people. I deliver you a letter which you will hand to him in person. The detail of your duty in the civil department I need not give you. Its best direction will be found in your innate love of Jus- tice and Zeal to be extensively useful to your fellowmen. A general direction to act according to the best of your Judgment in Cascs when these instructions are silent and the laws have not otherwise directed is given to you from the necessity of the case, for your great distance from Government will not permit you to wait for orders in many cases of great importance. In your negotiations with the Indians confine the stipulations as much as possible to the single object of obtaining peace from them Touch not the subject of lands or boundaries till particular orders are received. When necessity requires it presents may be made; but be as frugal in that matter as possible & let them know that Goods at present are scarce with us but we expect soon to trade freely with all the World and they shall not want goods when we can get them. The matters given you in charge are singular in their nature & weighty in their consequences to the people immediately concerned and to the whole State. They require the fullest exertion of your abilities and unwearied diligence. From matters of general concern you must turn occasionally to others of less consequence. Mr Rocheblave's Wife and Family must not suffer for want of that property of which they were bereft by our Troops. It is to be restored to them if possible. If this can not be done, the Public must support them.

A Coimandant as described in the Act is a civil Officer, & considering he is to hold his office during pleasure, it has been judged incompatible with any military office.

If I could by proper representations, impress them with a due sense of their error in facilitating the entrance of the rebels into their country, in neglecting their duty to their King, and committing an offense against God, I should in so doing feel a true satisfaction. I shall make it my glory to restore the happi- ness, and regain the confidence of a people who have been seduced from the right way, by evil examples and evil counsels, but who are still capable of discerning good from evil, and again becoming good subjects and good christians. The storm which threatens them on all sides is gathering fast, and will soon burst without distinction on the rebels and those who shall support them. Let them, therefore, imitate the conduct of their relations and friends at the post of St. Vincents, who, having seen their error, have by voluntarily forsaking it, availed themselves of the protection of his Britanic Majesty, ever dis- posed to forgot the faults of those who know to deserve his goodness, by returning to their duty. In order to make the inhabitants of the Illinois sensible of their dangerous situation, it is necessary to unfold to them the means and preparations which will be made use of to expel the rebels, and re- establish that peace and tranquility which have been distributed |disturbed | by those who feel no attachment but to their interest. The Chickasaws, Cherokees, and the other Southern nations, inveterate enemies to the rebels, are ready to invade the Illinois on the first opening of the spring, they will be sustained by a regi- ment of the King's troops now on their way from Pensacola with their officers, the whole under the conduct of the Superintendent of the Southern Department. The nations inhabiting the shores of the Lakes will all be de- voted to whatever service I shall recommend to them. Those of the Wabash who came down this fall have acted in concert with them, and have abandoned the flag of the rebels.

The reinforcement of the troops which I expect this spring will enable me to support the good, and to punish bad subjects.

I have mention'd to Gov. Hamilton that, as times seem [to] be Daily mºre and more precarious in this quarter, that it would not [be] imprudent to make a calculation of the Expences he may be likely to contract between this and next Septem; or later, for which he shºuld send us his Bills on the General, as payments late from that part would be of little service untill the spring following, the amount of those bills can be settled by the Sums the Govt shall draw on us for. This will be of great service to us should any unwished for revolution happen in this quarter, as it would secure to us what we will of course bill in advance for the different ºpartments. I hope Govt Hamilton will not think me too for- Ward for making this proposition.

The signature, however, is in Clark's own hand. The location of the letter was unknown for a number of years. While com- posing his Memoir, Clark strove, without success, to ascertain who pos- sessed it. His correspondence, at that time, was published in the Frankfort Commonwealth towards the close of the year 1826. This called attention to the Mason Letter. Lyman C. Draper, with this clue, took up the search for the missing document, and wrote to Colonel George Mason, who was living at Hollin Hall, the family home. Colonel Mason replied, February 8, 1827: “The narrative, to which you refer, written by Col. George Rogers Clark & sent to my Grand-Father is in my possession. It is not only a highly inter- esting, but very valuable document; and I have long since destined it for the safe keeping of some Public Institution. I cannot therefore, consign it to the hands of any Individual, much less those of an entire Stranger, as you are to me Sir–for individual purposes. It will soon be presented to the Historical Society of Kentucky; and it will then be at their discretion vo give you, or any other Gentleman, access to it.” In a postscript dated Feb- ruary 10, he stated that the manuscript had that day been sent to its desti- nation. (Draper MSS., 59.J 120. See also ibid., 2J8.) When the Kentucks Historical Society was dissolved, the narrative came into possession of the Honorable Henry Pirtle, the president of the society. It was published, in 114

However I excepted” it after being told the Command of this little Army was designed for me—I then got every request granted and fully impowered to raise as many Men as I could not exceeding a Certain Number.” After being engaged, I was then as Determined to prosecute it with Vigour, as I was before indifferent about the Command; I had since the beginning of the War taken pains to make myself acquainted with the true situation of the British posts on the Fronteers; and since find that I was not mis- taken in my judgment—I was ordered to Attact the Illinois in case of Success to carry my Arms to any Quarter I pleased I was certain that with five hundred Men I could take the Illinois, and by my treating the Inhabitants as fellow Citizens, and shew them that I ment to protect rather than treat them as a Conquered People.

I was happy with the thoughts of fair prospect of undeceiveing the Publick respecting their formidable Enemies on our Fronteers; I left Williamsburg January the 18th, made as quick dispatch as possible to the fronteers, and by the end of the month had Recruiting Parties disposed" from Pitsburg to Carolina, had my little Army Recruited in half the time I expected—Elivated with the thoughts of the great service we should do our Country in some measure; puting an end to the Indian War on our fronteers, it may appear to you to be a mear presumption in me, but I was * Originally: “to do so,” but the word “so" is stricken out. *Originally written “expected,” but changed to read “excepted.” This correction and the others noted below appear to have been made by the amanuensis. * Henry to Clark, ante, 36. “Originally: “dispatched,” but changed to “disposed.”

They received the Speeches from the Cap" with another of his own, and after some Consultation they resolved to take the Big Knives by the hand and came to a conclusion of Peace—And said the Americans must be Warriers and no de- ceivers, or they would never have spoke as they did; that they liked such People; and that the English was Liers and they would listen to them no longer; that by what they had heard of the Big knives, the Indians had as great a right to fight the English as they had, that they was convinced that it was the truth—What they alluded to was, part of the Speech that I had sent to them, explaining to them the nature of the War, in the following manner. That a great many years ago, our forefathers lived in England, but the King oppressed them in such a manner that they were obliged to Cross the great Waters to get out of his way; But he not being satisfied to loose so many Subjects sent Governours and Soldiers among them to make them obey his Laws, but told his Governours to treat them well and take but little from them until they grew populus, that then they would be able to pay a great deal; By the good treatment we got, we grew to be a great

I was determined to follow the Principal that I had set out upon, let the conscquence be what it would. I immediately ordered the Chiefs to be put into Irons by the French Militia.

To shew the Indians that I disregarded them. I remained in my Lodging in the Town about one hundred Yards from the Fort seemingly without a guard, but kept about fifty Men conceiled in a Parlour adjoining, and the Garrison under Arms; there was great Counciling among the Savages dureing the Night; But to make them have the greater idea of my Indifferency about them; I assembled a Number of Gentlemen & Ladies, and danced nearly the whole Night—In the morning I summoned the different Nations to a grand Council, and the Chief under Guard released, and invited to Council that I might speak to them in presence of the whole.

By this time the English party at Detroit, finding their influence among the Savages abate- ing, sent out messengers through the different Nations as far as they dare venture, Redoubled their Presents and insinuations to little purpose; as I had a Number of Persons well acquainted with the Indians, Spread through the whole that had treated with me, and Spies continually in and about Detroit for a considerable time.

As I was convinced that it was the mercinary views of their former Governours that Established them, paying no re- gard to the happiness of the People, and those Customs Strictly Observed that was most conducive to good order; I made it a Point to guard the happiness and Tranquility of the inhabitants supposing that their happy change reaching the ears of their Brothers and Countrymen on the Lakes and about Detroit, would be paving my way to that Place; and a good Effect on the Indians. I soon found it had the desired Effect; for the greatest part of the French Gen' and Traders among the Indians declared for us many Letters of Congratulation, sent from Detroit to the Gen' of the Illinois which gave me much Pleasure. I let slip no oppertunity, in Cultivating our growing Interest in every Quarter where there was the least appearance of a future advantage; and had as great Success as I had any right to expect. Great tranquility appeared in every countenance, being appre- hensive that the British Party at Detroit finding it hard to regain their lost Interest among the Savages would probably make a Descent on the Illinois if they found themselves capacitated,' for far of their finding out our Numbers (parties of Men coming & going from Kentucky and other places Recruits &c-) I suffered no Paſſade except the guards for a considerable time, and took every other precaution to keep every Person ignorant of our numbers which was generally thought to be nearly double what we really had.

Mº Hammilton in meantime had sent a party of 40 Savages headed by white Men from St Vincent in order if possible to take me Prisoner, and gave such Instructions for my treatment as did him no dishonour.

This Conduct inspired the Young Men in such a manner that many of them was getting their Horses to Share fate with me. But chusing to loose no time as soon as I could write a few lines on the back of my Letter to Captain Bow- man at Cohos, I set out for Kaskaskias; each Man [took] a Blanket, that in case the Fort was attacted We were to wrap ourselves in them fall in with the Enemies fire at the Fort until we had an op- pertunity of getting so near as to give the proper signals knowing that we should be let in. But on our Arrival we found everything as calm as we could expect. The weather being bad, it was then thought the Attact would not commence until it cleared up But no Person seem'd to doubt of the Enemies being at hand, and from many circumstances I could not but Suppose it was the case, and that they deferd the Attact for some time in order to give us time to Retreat; which I supposed they wou'd rather chuse by their pro- ceedings; But I was determined that they should be disappointed if that was their wishes. There was no time lost during the Night puting every thing in as good order as Possible. The Priest of all Men the most affraid of Mr Hammilton, he was in the greatest consternation, determined' to Act agreeable to my Instruction. I found by his Consternation that he was sure that the Fort would be taken, Except Reinforced by the Garrisson at Cohos which I did not chuse to let him know would be the case although I knew him to be a Zealous Friend.

I would have chose to have had those without families to Reinforce the Garrisson, and the rest to have lain Neuter. I resolved to burn part of the Town that was near the Fort and Guard it, as I knew the greatest service we possibly could do, was to Sell the Fort as Dear as possible; there being no probability of escaping after Attact, or expectation of Reinforcements, as we were too far detached from the Body of our Country. The only probable chance of safety was Cap" Bowmans joining me which I expected the next evening down the Messicippi, to defend our- selves until Mr Hamiltons Indians got tired and returned in four or five Weeks which I expected the greatest Part would do if they had not that Success that they expected. I had no occasion to Consult the Garrison in any Resolution I should fix upon as I knew that they was all as Spirited as I could wish them to be, and took pains to make them as desperate as possible. If You rightly Consider our Situation & Circumstance, You must conceive it to be desperate; in the morning the first thing I did was to assemble all the Inhabitants in order to know their Resolutions; as they had been the night Counciling with each other they expected some orders |sued which I did not chuse to do; at the Assembly I asked them what they thought of doing, whether they would endeavour to de- iênd The Town or not; if they did I would Quit the Fort leaving a Small Guard, and head them with the Troops; and if the Enemy lay until the weather Broke, we might probably in the meantime dis- cover their Camp and get some advantage of them. They appear'd to be in great confusion, and all my fear was, that they would agree to defend themselves, and if the Enemy was as numerous as was expected the whole would be lost. But I need not to have been uneasy about that, for they had too maturely studied their own Interest to think of fighting, which they certainly would have *one if I had only as many Troops as would have given any Probability of suckcess. they displai'd their situation in such a manner as was really moving and with great truth.

I very seldom found but I could govern my temper at pleasure: But this declaration of theirs and some other Circumstances put me in a most violent Rage, and as soon as I could curb my Passion gave a Lecture suitable for a set of Traitors, (although I could not conceive the whole of them to be such). I ordered them out of the Garrisson, and told them that I no longer thought they deserved favor from me, that I consequently must conceive them to be my secret Enemies and should treat them as such; They endeavoured to soothe me into pitty, but to have listned to them would have destroyed my intention. I determined to make my- self appear to them as desperate as Possible that it might have a Greater effect on the Enemy (they asked me to issue an order for all the Provision in the Town to be brought into the Fort im- mediately, by which I was convinced that it was their desire that I should be able to stand the Siege as long as possible, and only wanted an excuse to the Person they expected every moment to be their Master for making the supplies) I told them that I would have all the Provisions and then Burn the Town to the Enemies hand: that they might send the Provision if they chose it, and sent them out of the Fort: and immediately had fire set to Some out Houses; Never was a set of People in more distress; Their Town set on fire by those that they wished to be in friendship with; at the same time Surrounded by the Savages, as they ex- pected: from whom they had but little else but destruction to expect; The Houses being covered with Snow, the fire had no effect only on those it was set to; the Inhabitants looking on without daring to say a word: I told them that I intended to set fire to all those that had much Provision for fear of the Enemie's get- ting it: They were not in so great a Leathergy, but they took the hint and before night they brought in six months Provisions of all sorts; by which they were in hopes to come on better Terms: but a fresh Circumstance Alarmed them; one of the Inhabitants Riding into the Field met a Man that told him he saw a party of

I took his Evidence; sent for the Citizen who could not deny it. I immediately ordered him hanged: The Town took the Alarm hasted about the walls of the Fort, if possible to save their Friend. The Poor fellow given up to the Soldiers who dragged him to the place of Execution, each striving to be foremost in the Execution as if they thirsted after Blood: some was for Tomahawking him, Some for hanging & Others for Burning: they got to Quarreling about it; which at last saved his life; the Inhabitants having time to supplicate in his favour; but nothing would have saved his life but the appearance of his Wife and seven small Children, which sight was too moving not to have granted them the life of their Parent on terms that put it out of his power to do any damage to me—The weather clearing away Cap' Bowman Arrived the fºllowing day with his own and a compº of Volunteers from Cohos; we now began to make a tolerable appearance and seemd to defie the Enemy: and sent out Spies on every Quarter to make discovery of them hoping we might get some Advantage of them, chusing for many important Reasons to attact them two to one in the field rather than suffer them [to] take posses- Sion of the Town, which by the form and manner of Picquiting the Yards and Gardens was very Strong I was convinced that the Inhabitants now wished they had behaved in another manner I took the advantage of the favourable oppertunity to Attach them intirely in my Interest, and instead of Treating them more *Year as they expected on my being Reinforced, I altered my Con- *ct towards them and treated them with the greatest kindness, stanting them every request my Influence among them, in a few hours was greater than ever; they condemning themselves and thought that I had treated them as they deserved; and I believe, *d M.

We were now Sensi- ble that St Vincents was in possession of the English; and conse- quently we might shortly expect an Attact though no danger at present, and had some time to make preparation for what we were certain of I had reason to expect a Reinforcement on the presumption that Government ordered one on the Receipt of my first Letter; still encouraged each other and hoped for the best: But suffered more uneasiness than when I was certain of an immediate Attact, as I had more time to reflect: the Result of which was that the Illinois in a few months would be in the pos- session of the English except the Garrison which I knew would not be disposed to surrender without the greatest distress I sent off the Horsemen to St Vincents to take a Prisoner by which we might get intiligence, but found it impracticable, on account of the high waters; but in the hight of our anxiety on the evening of the 29th of Janux 1779 Mr Vague [Vigo) a Spanish Merchº Arrived from Sº Vincents, and was there the time of its being taken, and gave me every Intiligence that I could wish to have.

I resolved to appear as Darring as possible, that the Enemy might conceive by our behaviour that we were Very numerous and probably discourage them. I immediately wrote to the Inhabitants in general. Informing them where I was and what I determined to do desireing the Friends to the States to keep close in their Houses those in the British Interest to repair to the fort and fight for their King: otherways there should be no mercy shewn them &c.—&c—Sending the Compliments of several Officers that was known to be Expected to reinforce me, to several Gentlemen of the Town: I dispatched the Prisoner off with this ºtter waiting until near sunset, giving him time to get near the Town before we marched. As it was an open Plain from the Wood that covered us; I march'd time enough to be seen from the Town before dark but taking advantage of the Land, disposed the ºnesin such a manner that nothing but the Pavilions could be seen, having as many of them as would be sufficient for a thousand Men, which was observed by the Inhabitants, who had Just Re- *iv'd my letter counted the different Colours and Judged our *mber accordingly But I was careful to give them no opper- "imity of seeing our Troops before dark, which it would be before * could Arrive: The Houses obstructed the Forts observing us and were not Allarmed as I expected by many of the Inhabitants: detached Lieu' Bayley and party to Attact the Fort at a cer- ºn Signal, and took possession of the strongest Posts of the Town

I thanked the Chief for his intended service, told him the Ill consequence of our People being mingled in the dark; that they might lay in their Quarters until light. he Ap- proved of it and sent off his Troops appeared to be much elivated himself and staid with me giving all the Information he could. (I knew him to be a friend) The Artillery from the Fort played briskly but did no execution. The Garrisson was intirely sur- rounded within eighty and a hundred Yards behind Houses Palings and Ditches &c-&c.—Never was a heavier fireing kept up on both sides for eighteen Hours with so little damage done. In a few hours I found my Prize sure, Certain of taking every Man that I could have wished for, being the whole of those that incited the Indians to War: all my past sufferings vanished: never was a Man more happy. It wanted no encouragement from any Officer to inflame our Troops with a Martial Spirit. The Knowl- edge of the Person they attacted and the thoughts of their masse- cred friends was Sufficient. I Knew that I could not afford to loose Men, and took the greatest care of them that I possibly could: at the same time encouraged thcm to be daring, but prudent. every place near the fort that could cover them was crowded, and a very heavy firing during the Night. having flung up a consider- able Intrenchment before the gate where I intended to plant my Artillery when Arrived. I had learnt that one Masonvillehadarived that evening with two prisoners taken on the Ohio discovering some sign of us, supposed to be spies from Kentucky, immediately on his arival Cap" Lemote was sent out to intercept them; being out on our Arival could not get in the Fort; in attempting several of his men was made Prisoners, himself and party hovering round the Town; I was convinced that they wou'd make off to

The firing again com- menced, A number of the Inhabitants Joining the Troops & Be- haved exceeding well in General; knowing of the Prisoners lately taken and by the discription I had of them I was sure of their being the Express from Williamsburg (but was mistaken) to save the papers and Letters; about Eight o'clock in the morning I ordered the fireing to cease and sent a flag into the Garrisson with a hard Bill Recommended Mr Hamilton to surrender his Garrisson & severe threats if he should destroy any Letters &c. He return'd an Ans" to this purpose; that the Garrisson was not disposed to be awed into any thing unbecomeing British Soldiers: the Attact was Renewed with greater Vigour than ever and con- tinued for about two hours; I was determined to listen to no Terms whatever until I was in Possession of the Fort; and only ment to keep them in Acttion with part of my Troops, while I was making necessary preparations with the other (neglected calling on any of the Inhabitants for Assistants although they wished for it) A flag appeard from the Fort with a Proposition from M’ Hamilton for three days Cessation—A desire of a Conference with me immediately, that if I should make any difficulty of comeing into the Fort, he would meet me at the Gate: I at first had no notion of listening to any thing he had to say as I could only consider himself & Officers as Murderers, And intended to treat them as such: but after Some deliberation I sent M: Hamilton my Compliments, and beged leave to in- form him that I should agree to no other terms than his sur- rendering himself and Garrisson Prisoners at discretion; but if he was desirous of a Conference with me I would meet him at the Church. We accordingly met, he Offered to surrender but we could not agree upon terms. He received such treat- ment on this Conference as a Man of his known Barbarity de- serv'd. I would not come upon terms with him, recommend" to him to defend himself with spirit and Bravery, that it was the

Page 144
144 ILLINOIS HISTORICAL COLLECTIONS 2 only thing that would induce me to treat him and his Garrison with Lenity in case I stormed it which he might expect. He asked me what more I could Require than the offers he had already made I told him (which was really the truth) that I wanted a sufficient excuse to put all the Indians & partisans to death, as the greatest part of those Villians was then with him: all his proposi- tions was refus'd: he asked me if nothing would do but fighting I knew of nothing else: he then begged me to stay until he should return to the Garrisson and consult his Officers: being indiferent about him and wanted a few moments for my Troops to refresh themselves I told him that the firing should not commence until such an hour, that during that time he was at Liberty to pas with safety. Some time before a Party of Warriers sent by M. Hamilton against Kentucky, had taken two Prisoners, was dis. coverd by the Kickebues who gave information of them. A Party was immediately Detached to meet them which hapned in the Commons: they conceived our Troops to be a Party sent by M. Hamilton to conduct them in; an hon commonly paid them. I was highly pleased to see each Party hooping, hollowing and Strik ing each others Breasts as they approached in the open fields each seemed to try to out do the other in the greatest signs of Joy: the Poor Devils never discovered their mistake until it was too late for many of them to escape; Six of them was made Prisoners, two of them Scalped and the rest so wounded as we afterwards learnt, but one Lived. I had now a fair oppertunity of making an impression on the Indians that I could have wished for; that of convincing them that Governour Hamilton could not give them that protection that he had made them to believe he could in some measure to insence the Indians against him for not Ex- erting himself to save their Friends: Ordered the Prisoners to be Tomahawked in the face of the Garrisson: It had the effect that I expected: insted of making their friends inviterate against us, they upbraided the English Parties in not trying to save their friends and gave them to understand that they believed them to be liers and no Warriers—A remarkable Circumstance happed that I think worthy our notice: An old French Gent of the name of Sº Croix Licut of Cap" M*Carty's Volunteers from Cohos had but one Son who headed these Indians and was made Prisoner.
Page 145
CLARK TO MASON, NOVEMBER 19, 1779 145 The Question was put whether the White Man Should be saved. I ordered them to put him to Death, through Indignation which did not extend to the Savages. for fear he would make his escape, his father drew his Sword and stood by him in order to Run him through in case he should stir; being painted could not know him. The Wretch on seeing the Executioners Tomahawk raised to give the fatal Stroke, raised his eyes as if making his last Addresses to heaven; Cried out O Save me. The father knew his Son's voice you may easily guess of the adgetation and behaviour of these two Persons comeing to the knowledg of each other at so critical a moment. I had so little mercy for such Murderers, and so valu- able an oppertunity for an Example; knowing there would be the greatest selicitations made to save him, that I immediately ab- sconded myself: but by the warmest Selicitations from his father who had behaved so exceedingly well in our Service; and some of the Officers, I granted his Life on certain conditions Mº Hamilton and myself again met: he produced certain Articles which was refused; but towards the close of the Evening I sent him the following Articles— 1* That Lieu" Governour Hamilton engages to deliver up to Col”Clark, Fort Sackville as it is at present with all the Stores &c.— 2" The Garrisson are to deliver themselves up Prisoners of War and March out with their Arms and Acoutriments &c. &c.— 3* The Garrison to [be] Delivered up tomorrow at ten Oclock— 4* Three days time be allowed the Garrison to settle their Accompts with the Traders and Inhabitants of this Place— 5* The Officers of the Garrisson to be allowed their neces- sary Baggage &c.—&c— Which was agreed to and fulfilled the next day knowing that Governour Hamilton had sent a Party of Men up the Ouabach to Ome for Stores that he had left there which must be on the return; I waited about twelve hours for the Arival of the Galley to Intercept them; but fearing their getting Intiligence, dispatchd Cap" Helms with a Party in Armed Boats who Supprised and made Prisoners of forty, among which was Dejeane, Grand Judge of Detroit with a large Packet from Detroit, and seven Boats load of Provisions, Indian Goods &c.—Never was a Person more morti- fied than I was at this time to see so fair an opportunity to push a i i *

I was better able to fix my future Plans of operation against Du Troit. By his Excellencies Letter I might expect to have a Compleat Batallian in a few months, the Militia of the Illinois I knew would turn out, did not doubt of getting two or three hundred Men from Kentucky Consequently put the matter out of doubt. I contented myself on that Presumption having almost as many Prisoners as I had Men—Seeing the necessity of geting rid of many of the Prisoners, not being able to guard them; not doubting but my good treatment of the Volunteers Inhabitants of Detroit would Promote my Interest there I discharged the greatest Part of them that had been with Indian Parties, on their taking the Oath of Neutrality. They went off huzzaing for the Congress and de- clared though they could not fight against the Americans they would for them. (As I after this had Spies constant to and from Detroit I learnt they answered every purpose that I could have wished for, by prejudiceing their friends in favour of America. So certain was the Inhabitants of that Post, of my Marching immediately against it, that they made Provision for me in defiance of the Garrison Many of them has paid dear for it since. I dispatched off Capt Williams and Compy with Governour Hamilton, his principal Officers and a few Soldiers to the Falls of Ohio, to be sent to Williamsburg, and in a few days sent my letters to the Govour. Having matters a little setled, the Indian De- partment became the next Object. I knew that Mr Hamilton had endeavoured to make them believe that we intinded at last to take all their Lands from them and that in case of Success we should shew no greater Mercy for those that did not Join him than those that did. I indeavoured to make my- self acquainted [with] the Arguments he used: And calling to: gether the Neighbouring Nations, Peankeshaws, Kickepoes, & others that would not listen to him Indeavoured to undeceive them; I made a very long Speach to them in the Indian manner. Extol'd them to the Skies for their Manly behaviour and fedility;
Page 147
CLARK TO MASON, NOVEMBER 19, 1779 147 told them that we were so far from having any design on their Lands, that I looked upon it that we were on their Land where the Fort stood, that we claimed no Land in their Country; that the first Man that offered to take their Lands by Violence must strike the tomhk in my head; that it was only necessary that I should be in their Country during the War and keep a Fort in it to drive off the English, who had a design against all People; after that I might go to some place whore I could get Land to support Me: The Treaty was concluded to the satisfaction of both parties; they were much plcased at what they hear'd and begged me to favour them the next day with my Comp3 at a Council of theirs I accordingly Attended: greatest part of the time spent in Ceremony; They at last told me they had been meditating on what I had said the day before: that all the Nations would be rejoiced to have me always in their Country as their great Father and Protector: And as I had said I would claim no Land in their Country, they were determin'd that they would not loose me on that Account: and Resolved to give me a piece, but larger than they had given to all the French at that Village, and laying down what they would wish me to do &c.—I was well pleased at their offer as I had then an opportunity to deny the oxceptance, & farther convince them that we did not want their Land; they appear'd dejected at my Refusial; I waved the discourse upon other Subjects: Recommended a frolick to them that night as the Sky was clearer than ever; gave them a qunty of Taffy" and Provisions to make merry on and left them. In a few days some Chipoways and others who had been with Mr Hamilton, came in and begged me to excuse their blindness and take them into favour; after the warmest Silicitations for Mercy, I told them that the Big Knives was merciful which Proved them to be Warriers; that I should send Belts and a Speech to all the Nations: that they after hearing of it might do as they pleased but must blame themselves for future misfortunes and dispatched them. Nothing destroys Your Interest among the Savages so soon as wavering sentiments or specches that shew the least fear. I consequently had observed one steady line of conduct among them: Mr Hamil- 'Tafa was a cheap rum which was in general use throughout the West.

148 ILLINOIS HISTORICAL COLLECTIONS ton, who was almost Deified among them being captured by me, it was a sufficient confirmation to the Indians of every thing I had formerly said to them and gave the greatest weight to the Speeches I intended to send them: expecting that I should shortly be able to fulfill my threats with a Body of Troops sufficient to penetrate into any part of their Country: and by Reducing Detroit bring them to my feet—I sent the following Speech to the different Tribes near the Lakes that was at war with us. to wit— To the Warriers of the different Nations— Men and Warriers; it is a long time since the Big Knives sent 3elts of peace among You Siliciting of you not to listen to the bad talks and deceit of the English as it would at some future day tend to the Destruction of your Nations. You would not listen, but Joined the English against the Big Knives and spilt much Blood of Women & Children. The Big Knives then resolved to shew no mercy to any People that hereafter would refuse the Belt of Peace which should be offered, at the same time One of War; You remember last summer a great many People took me by the hand, but a few kept back their Hearts. I also sent Belts of Peace and War among the Nations to take their choice. some took the Peace Belt; others still listned to their great father (as they call him) at Detroit, and Joined him to come to War against me. The Big Knives are Warriers and look on the English as old Women and all those that Join him, and are ashamed when they fight them because they are no Men. I now send two Belts to all the Nations, one for Peace and the other for War. The one that is for War has your great English fathers Scalp tied to it, and made red with his Blood; all you that call yourselves his Children, make your Hatchets sharp & come out and Revenge his Blood on the Big knives fight like Men that the Big Knives may not be ashamed when they fight you; that the old Women may not tell us that we only fought Squaws. If any of you is for taking the Belt of Peace send the Bloody Belt back to me that I may know who to take by the hand as Brothers, for you may be Assured that no peace for the future will be granted to those that do not lay down their Arms immediately. Its as you will I dont care whether you are for Peace or War; as I Glory in

And You may expect in four Moons to see Your Women & Children given to the Dogs to eat, while those Nations that have kept their words with me will Flourish and grow like the Willow Trees on the River Banks under the care and nourishment of their father the Big Knives. In a few weeks great Numbers came into St Vincents and treated for Peace being laughed at by those that had strictly adhear'd to their former Treaty with me. After fixeing every Department so as to promise future advantage sending Letters to County Lieu' of Kentucky siliciting him to make some prepari- tory strokes towards Joining me when calld on with all the force he could Raise, leaving a sufficient Garrison on the 20th of march I set out for Kaskaskias by Water with a Guard of eighty Men, spending much time in making some observation at different places; consequently Arrived too late to have hindred a War that commenced between the few Delawares residing in this part of the World and the Inhabitants; a few of them that had joined the British Party knowing what had hapned went to Kaskaskias, as was supposed to compromise matters; but getting drunk with some loose young fellows gave some thereats [sic] on each side; one of the Indians snaping a Gun at a Womans Breast two of them was im- mediately Killed the rest pursu'd by the Townsmen some distance down the River one Killed and some others wounded. The War was carried on Pretty cqual on both sides for several Months: but they at last thought proper to Silicit a peace. During my absence Capº Robert George Commands the Compy formerly Cap' Willings; had Arrived from Orleans taking charge of the Garrison which was a considerable Reinforcement to our little Party. Every thing having the Appearance of Tranquility, I resolv'd to spend a few weeks in Divertions which I had not done since my Arrival in the Illinois, but found it impossible when I had any matter of importance in view, the Reduction of Detroit was al- ways uppermost in my mind, not from a motive of Applause; but from the desire I had of Establishing a Profound Peace on the

The Civil Departm". In the Illinois had heretofore rob'd me of too much of my time that ought to be spent in Military re- flections I was now likely to be Relieved by Colº Jnº. Todd appointed by Government for that Purpose; I was anctious for his Arrival & happy in his appointment as the greatest intimacy and friendship subsisted between us; and on the [blank] of may had the Pleasure of seeing him safely Landed at Kaskaskias to the Joy of every Person: I now saw myself happily rid of a piece of trouble that I had no delight in—in a few days, Colº Montgomery arrived to my Mortification, found that he had not half the Men that I expected; immediately receiveing a letter from Colº Bow- man with fresh Assurances of a considerable Reinforcement. The Officers in Gen' being anctious for the Expedition, Resolved to rendevoux according to appointment; and if not deceived by the Kentuckyans I should still be able to compleat my design, as I only wanted men sufficient to make me appear Respectable in Pass- ing through the Savages by which means I could on the March Command those friendly at my ease, and defy my Enemies. Three hundred Men being at this time sufficient to Reduce the Garrisson of Detroit, as the new Works was not Compleat, nor could be ac- cord" to Plan before my Arrival. The Gentlemen of Detroit not

This effectually stopt their operation; knowing that the Expedition depended intirely on the Kentuckians turning out, I began to be suspicious of a disappoint- ment on hearing of their Marching against the Shownee Towns which proved too true for on my arrival at St Vincents the first of July, instead of two or three hundred Men that I was promised; I found only about thirty Volunteers, meeting with a Repulse from the Shawnees got discouraged Consequently not in the power of the Com" to March them as Militia, being for some time, (as I hinted before) suspitious of a disappointment, I had conducted matters so as to make no Ill impression on the minds of the Savages in case I should not proceed as the whole had suspected that my design was against Detroit. Several Nations silicited me to go and suffer them to Join me. Various was the conjectures respect- ing the Propriety of the Attempt with the Troops we had (about three hund" & fifty) at a Council of War held for the purpose there was only two casting voices against it and I pretend it was on account of Gen.' Sullivants Marching against Niagary, which we had Just heard that stopt us that there was no doubt of his success Detroit would fall of course; and consequently was not worth our while Marching against it: although I knew at [the] same time that Detroit would not fall with Niagary, as they had an easy communication with Montreal through another Channel by way of the Grand River. A number of Indians visited me at this time renewing the Chain of friendship &c. To all of whom I gave Gen.' satisfaction, except that of my refutial of a Tract of Land that their Chief had formerly offered me; I inquired of several Gentle- men acquainted with them, why they were Silicitus about it; their oppinions was that the Indians being exceedingly Jealous of their
Page 152
152 ILLINOIS HISTORICAL COLLECTIONS º Lands being taken without their Consent, being told by the Eng- lish that I had a design on their Country, by my exceping a Tract from them as a preasant, would prove sufficiently to them that what they had been told was false, being satisfyed in this they also had a desire of my Remaining In their Country as their Chief and Guardian and that my refusial had given them suspicion; in order to Remove it I made a suitable Speech to them which gave Gen. satisfaction and in a few days they with a great deal of Ceremony presented me the following Deed of gift— By the Tobacos Son Grand Chief of all the Peankeshaw Na- tions & of all the Tribes. Grand Dore to the Ouabache as ordered by the master of Life, holding the Tomahawk in one hand and peace in the other.

Whereas for many years past, this once peaceable Land hath Seen put in confusion by the English encouraging all People to Raise the Tommahawk Against the Big Knives, saying that they were a bad people, Rebellious, and ought to be put from under Sun and their names to be no more. But as the Sky at our Councils was always Misty and never Clear we was still at a loss to know what to do, hoping that the Master of Life would one Day or other make the Sky Clear and put us in the right Road. He taking Pitty on us sent a father among us (Colº George Rogers Clark) that has cleared our eyes and made our Paths straight defending our Lands &c.—So that we now enjoy Peace from the Rising to the Seting of Sun; and the Nations even to the heads of the great River (meaning the Messi- cippi) are happy and will no more listen to Bad Birds; but abide by the Councils of their great father, A Chief of the Big Knives that is now among us— And whereas it is our desire that he should long remain among us, that we may take his Council and be happy; it also being our desire to give him Lands to reside on in our Country that we may at all times speak to him.

At last about two o'clock we came insight of this long sought town and enemy, all quiet, the spirits of my men seemed to revive we marched up under cover of a wood called the Warriours Island where we lay concealed untill sunset, Several of the inhabitants were out a shooting by which was assur'd they had no intelligence of us yet. I sent out two men to bring in one who came and I sent him to town to inform the inhabitants I was near them ordering all those attached to the King of England to enter the Fort and defend it, those who desired to be friends to keep in their houses. I order'd the march in the first division Capt. Williams, Capt. Worthington's Company and the Cascaskia Volunteers, in the 2nd commanded by Capt. Bow- man his own Company and the Cohos Volunteers. At sun down I put the divisions in motion to march in the greatest order and regularity and observe the orders of their officers—above all to be silent—the 5 men we took in the canoes were our guides; we entered the town on the upper part having detached Lt. Bayley and 15 riflemen to attack the Fort and keep up a fire to harrass them until we took possession of the town and they were to remain on that duty untill relieved by another party, the two divisions marched into the town and took possession of the main street, put guards &c without the least molestation I continued all night sending parties out to annoy the enemy and caused a trench to be thrown up across the main street about 200 yds from the Fort Gate— we had intelligence that Capt. Lamotte and 30 men were sent out about 3 hours before our arrival to reconnoitre, as it seems they had some suspicion of a party being near them. One Maisonville and a party of Indians coming up the Ouabache with 2 prisoners made on the Ohio had discover'd our fires and they arrived here a few hours before us. I order'd out a party immediately to intercept them and took sº Maisonville and one man—they gave us no intelligence worth mentioning. 24th As soon as daylight appeared the enemy perceived our works and began a very smart fire of small arms at it, but could not bring their cannon to bear on them, about 8 o'clock I sent a flag of truce with a letter desiring Lt. Gov. Hamilton in order to save the impending storm that hung over his head immediately

H. begs leave to acquaint Col. C. that he and his Garrison were not disposed to be awed into any action unworthy of British subjects—I then ordered out parties to attack the Fort and the firing began very smartly on both sides one of my men thro' a bravery known but to Amer- icans walking carlesly up the main street was slightly wounded over the left eye but no ways dangerous—About 12 o'clock the firing from the Fort suspended a Flag coming out I order'd my people to stop firing till further orders. I soon perceived it was Capt. Helm who after salutations inform'd me that the purport of his commission was, that Lt. Gov. Hamilton was willing to surrender up the Fort and Garrison provided Col. Clarke would grant him honourable terms and that he beg'd Col. Clarke to come into the Fort to confer with him, first I desired Capt. Helm not to give any inteligence of G. H.’s strength &" he being on his Parole, second my answer to Gov. H was that I should not agree to any other terms than that Lt. Gov. H should immediately surrender at discretion and allowed him half an hour to consider thereof— as to entering the Fort my off" and men would not allow of it, for it was with difficulty I restrained them from storming the Garrison.

Clark would let him do it with Honour—I answered him I have been informed that he had 800 men—I have not that number but I came to fight that number. G. H. then replied who could give you this false information I am Sir (replied I) well acquainted with your strength and force and am able to take your Fort, therefore I will give no other terms but to submit yourself and Garrison to my discretion and mercy—he reply'd Sir my men are brave and willing to stand by me to the last, if I can't surrender upon Honºle terms I'll fight it out to the last—Answered, Sir this will give my men infinite satisfaction and pleasure for it is their desire, he left me and went a few pays aloof, I told Capt Helm Sir you are a prisoner on your parole, I desire you to reconduct G. H. into the Fort and there remain till I retake you. Lt Gov. Hamil- ton then returned saying, Col. Clarke why will you force me to dis- honour myself when you cannot acquire more honor by it—I told him could I look on you Sir as a Gentlemen I would do to the t1tmost of my power, but on you Sir who have embrued your hands in the blood of our women and children, Honor, my country, everything calls on me alloud for Vengeance.

DEARSIR- A few days ago, I received certain intelligence of William Morris[Myers].” my express to you, being killed near the falls of Ohio, news truly disagreeable to me, as I fear many of my letters will fall into the hands of the enemy, at Detroit, although some ºf them, as I learn, were found in the woods torn in pieces.” I donot doubt but before the receipt of his, you will have heard of my late success against Governor Hamilton, at post St. Vincennes. That gentleman, with a body of men, possessed himself of that Pºst on the 15th of December last, repaired the fortifications for a *pository, and in the spring, meant to attack this place, which he made no doubt of carrying; where he was to be joined by two hundred Indians from Michilimackinac, and five hundred Chero- * Chickasaws, and other nations. With this body, he was to Penetrate up the Ohio to Fort Pitt, sweeping Kentucky on his "4% having light brass cannon for the purpose, joined on his match by all the Indians that could be got to him. He made no ºbt, that he could force all West Augusta. This expedition *s ordered by the commander-in-chief of Canada.

170 ILLINOIS HISTORICAL COLLECTIONS as my number of men was too small to stand a siege, and my situa- tion too remote to call for assistance. I made all the preparations I possibly could for the attack, and was necessitated to set fire to some of the houses in town, to clear them out of the way. But in the height of the hurry, a Spanish merchant," who had been at St. Vincennes, arrived, and gave the following intelligence: that Mr. Hamilton had weakened himself, by sending his Indians against the frontiers, and to block up the Ohio; that he had not more than eighty men in garrison, three pieces of cannon, and some swivels mounted; and that he intended to attack this place, as soon as the winter opened, and made no doubt of clearing the western waters by the fall. My situa- tion and circumstances induced me to fall on the resolution of attacking him, before he could collect his Indians again. I was sensible the resolution was as desperate as my situa- tion, but I saw no other probability of securing the country. I immediately despatched a small galley, which I had fitted up, mounting two four pounders and four swivels, with a company of men and necessary stores on board, with orders to force her way, if possible, and station herself a few miles below the enemy, suffer nothing to pass her, and wait for further orders. In the mean- time, I marched across the country with one hundred and thirty men,” being all I could raise, after leaving this place garrisoned by the militia. The inhabitants of the country behaved exceedingly well, numbers of young men turned out on the expedition, and every other one embodied to guard the different towns. I marched the 7th of February. Although so small a body, it took me six- teen days on the route. The inclemency of the season, high waters, &c., seemed to threaten the loss of the expedition. When within three leagues of the enemy, in a direct line, it took us five days to cross the drowned lands of the Wabash river, having to wade often, upwards of two leagues, to our breast in water. Had not the weather been warm, we must have perished. But on the evening of the 23d, we got on dry land, in sight of the enemy; and at seven o'clock, made the attack, before they knew anything of us.

CLARK TO HENRY, APRIL 29, 1779 171 in the seige. There was a continual fire on both sides, for eighteen hours. I had no expectation of gaining the fort until the arrival of my artillery. The moon setting about one o'clock, I had an entrenchment thrown up within rifle shot of their strongest battery, and poured such showers of well-directed balls into their ports, that we silenced two pieces of cannon in fifteen minutes, without getting a man hurt. Governor Hamilton and myself had, on the following day, several conferences, but did not agree until the evening, when he agreed to surrender the garrison (seventy-nine in number) prisoners of war, with considerable stores. I got only one man wounded; not being able to lose many, I made them secure themselves well. Seven were badly wounded in the fort, through the ports. In the height of this action, an Indian party that had been to war, and taken two prisoners, came in, not knowing of us. Hearing of them, I despatched a party to give them battle in the commons, and got nine of them, with the two prisoners, who proved to be Frenchmen. Hearing of a convoy of goods from Detroit, I sent a a party of sixty men, in armed boats well mounted with swivels, to meet them, before they could receive any intelligence. They met the convoy forty leagues up the river, and made a prize of the whole, taking forty prisoners and about ten thousand pounds worth of goods and provisions; also, the mail from Canada to Governor Hamilton, containing, however, no news of importance. But what crowned the general joy, was the arrival of William Mor- ris, my express to you, with your letters, which gave general satisfaction. The soldiery, being made sensible of the gratitude of their country for their services, were so much elated, that they would have attempted the reduction of Detroit, had I ordered them. Having more prisoners than I knew what to do with, I was obliged to discharge a greater part of them, on parole. Mr. Hamilton, his principal officers and a few soldiers, I have sent to Kentucky, under a convoy of Captain Williams, in order to be conducted to you. After despatching Morris with letters to you, treating with the neighboring Indians, &c., I returned to this Place, leaving a sufficient garrison at St. Vincennes. During my absence, Captain Robert George, who now commands the Company formerly commanded by Captain Willing, had
Page 172
172 ILLINOIS HISTORICAL COLLECTIONS returned from New Orleans, which greatly added to our strength. It gave great satisfaction to the inhabitants, when acquainted with the protection which was given them, the alliance with France, &c. I am impatient for the arrival of Colonel Mont- gomery, but have heard nothing of him lately. By your instruc- tions to me, I find you put no confidence in General M'Intosh's taking Detroit, as you encourage me to attempt it, if possible. It had been twice in my power. Had I been able to raise only five hundred men when I first arrived in the country, or when I was at St. Vincennes, could I have secured my prisoners, and only have had three hundred good men, I should have attempted it, and since learn there could have been no doubt of success, as by some gentlemen lately from that post, we are informed that the town and country kept three days in feasting and diversions, on hearing of my success against Mr. Hamilton, and were so certain of my embracing the fair opportunity of possessing myself of that post, that the merchants and others provided many necessaries for us on our arrival; the garrison, consisting of only eighty men, not daring to stop their diversions. They are now completing a new fort, and I fear too strong for any force I shall ever be able to raise in this country. We are proud to hear Congress intends putting their forces on the frontiers, under your direction. A small army from Pittsburg, conducted with spirit, may easily take Detroit, and put an end to the Indian war. Those Indians who are active against us, are the six nations, part of the Shawnese, the Meamonies [Miami), and about half the Chesaweys (Chippewa, Ottawas, Jowaas (Iowa?], and Pottawatimas nations, bordering on the lakes. Those nations who have treated with me, have be- haved since very well; to wit, the Peankishaws, Kiccapoos, Or- caottenans of the Wabash river, the Kaskias, Perrians [Peorial, Mechigamies, Foxes, Socks, Opays [Peorias?], Illinois and Poues [Potawatomij, nations of the Mississippi and Illinois rivers. Part of the Chessaweys have also treated, and are peaceable. I con- tinually keep agents among them, to watch their motions and keep them peaceably inclined. Many of the Cherokees, Chicka- saws, and their confederates, are, I fear, ill disposed. It would be well if Colonel Montgomery should give them a dressing, as he comes down the Tennessee. There can be no peace expected from
Page 173
CLARK TO HENRY, APRIL 29, 1779 173 many nations, while the English are at Detroit. I strongly sus- pect they will turn their arms against the Illinois, as they will be encouraged. I shall always be on my guard, watching every opportunity to take the advantage of the enemy, and, if I am ever able to muster six or seven hundred men, I shall give them a shorter distance to come and fight me, than at this place. There is one circumstance very distressing, that of our moneys being discredited, to all intents and purposes, by the great number of traders who come here in my absence, each outbidding the Other, giving prices unknown in this country by five hundred per cent, by which the people conceived it to be of no value, and both French and Spaniards refused to take a farthing of it. Provision is three times the price it was two months past, and to be got by no Other means than my own bonds, goods, or force. Several merchants are now advancing considerable sums of their own prop- erty, rather than the service should suffer, by which I am sensible they must lose greatly, unless some method is taken to raise the credit of our coin, or a fund be sent to Orleans, for the payment of the expenses of this place, which would at once reduce the price of every species of provision; money being of little service to them, unless it would pass at the ports they trade at. I mentioned to you, my drawing some bills on Mr. Pollock in New Orleans, as I had no money with me. He would accept the bills, but had not money to pay them off, though the sums were trifling; so that we have little credit to expect from that quarter. I shall take every step I possibly can, for laying up a sufficient quantity of pro- visions, and hope you will immediately send me an express with your instructions. Public expenses in this country, have hitherto been very low, and may still continue so, if a correspondence is fixed at New Orleans for payment of expenses in this country, or gold and silver sent. I am glad to hear of Colonel Todd's ap- Pointment. I think government has taken the only step they °ould have done, to make this country flourish, and be of service * them. No other regulation would have suited the people. The last account I had of Colonel Rogers, was his being in New Orleans, "ith six of his men. The rest he left at the Spanish Ozack, above the Natches. I shall immediately send him some provisions, as I *n he is in great want. I doubt, he will not be able to get his
Page 174
174 ILLINOIS HISTORICAL COLLECTIONS J goods up the river except in Spanish bottoms. One regiment would be able to clear the Mississippi, and do great damage to the British interests in Florida, and, by properly conducting them- selves, might perhaps gain the affection of the people, so as to raise a sufficient force to give a shock to Pensacola. Our alliance with France has entirely devoted this people to our interest. I have sent several copies of the articles to Detroit, and do not doubt but they will produce the desired effect. Your instructions I shall pay implicit regard to, and hope to conduct myself in such a manner as to do honor to my country. I am, with the greatest respect, your humble servant, G. R. CLARKE. P. S. I understand there is a considerable quantity of cannon ball at Pittsburg. We are much in want of four and six pound ball. I hope you will immediately order some down. REPORT BY LIEUTENANT-GoverNor HENRY HAMILTON ON HIS PROCEEDINGS FROM November, 1776 to JUNE, 1781. {Report of the British Hist. MSS. Commission, 1910.]" SIR,-The last letter I had the honor of addressing to your Excellency was dated May the seventh, 1781, and was accom- panied with returns of the Prisoners, a general account of dis- bursements, and of Cash received at different times, duplicates of all which shall be sent by the first opportunity. The Packett which brought Major Hay and myself sailed from Sandy Hook on the 27th May, and arrived at Falmouth on the 21st June. Yesterday being the 5th of July I had the honor of paying my respects to Lord George Germaine. His Lordship was pleased to *The copy of this report which was made by the commission, was taken from the manuscripts in the possession of Mrs. Stopford, Sackville. It has been corrected by collating with the original in the British Museum, 21783, f. 48, from which it differs in the addition of seven paragraphs at the close of the report. A copy of the report from the copy in the Canadian Archives, B., 123, p. 53, was published in the Mich. Pioneer and Hist. Coll., IX., 489 et seq. Except in a few instances this follows the original in the British Museum, the difference being in the paragraphing and in a few words which were mis- read.

HAMILTON'S REPORT 175 attend to the account I gave of our ill-success, and the treatment We experienced from the Rebels, from the day of our being made prisoners of War the 25 Feby 1779 to the 4th March 1781, when We were totally out of their power by a final exchange. Having mentioned to His Lordship that I had preserved a diary ºf transactions he directed me to commit to paper a brief account, and transmit the same to your Excellency. In obedience to His Lordship's orders I shall endeavor to avoid detail and supply as well as may be the want of such papers as were seized by Order of the Rebel Governor Mr. Jefferson, on our being thrown into the Dungeon at Williamsburg; some things previous to the arrival of your Excellency at Quebec, it may be proper slightly to mention. On the 9th day of November I arrived at Detroit, and almost immediately applications were made by the Indians for my assent to their making inroads upon the Frontiers of Pennsylvania and Virginia, this I declined giving not having received positive orders on the subject, and the rebels being in possession of Montreal, all intercourse with Sir Guy Carleton was cut off. In the month of June 1777 Lieutenant Governor Cramahé wrote me a Letter containing the copy of Lord George Germaine's orders and instructions, by which I was Authorized to appoint proper Cicers and Interpreters and to send them with the Indians against the Rebels, with the strictest injunctions to discourage and restrain them from their usual barbarities. A most strict adherence to these injunctions has been observed on my part, and as whatever I advance can be well supported, I shall mention some of the measures taken with the Indians, to invalidate the odious falsaties propagated by the Rebels in different Parts of America, and to shew that the Savages have yielded to *straint, and foregone their habits of cruelty." When any party Indians were desirous of going on a discovery, they were brought to me by the Interpreters, every dissuasive *gainst cruelty was used their pretensions to the title of Warriors *in a just light, presents promised them for prisoners brought in *ive, which the liberality of Government enabled me to make them, and the stability of future peace urged if after the conclusion ‘See Introduction, ante, xxxvii.

Some or all these arguments had their weight with the very first party sent out, which returnd with seven prisoners alive, who testifyed to the gentle treatment shewn by the Savages. The presents given on this occasion were incentive to other parties to act in like manner, and when we went against St. Vincennes we left 129 prisoners of different Ages and Sexes, who seemed heartily grateful for their humane treatment, being clothed and fed at the expence of the Crown, and allowed all liberty within the settlement. On the 6th of August 1778 intelligence was brought me by Mr. Francis Maisonville of the attack of the Illinois by Colonel Clarke, the shamefull treatment of Monsieur de Rocheblave, who was laid in Irons and put into a place where hogs had been kept, ankle deep in filth, the indignities offered Madame de Rocheblave, the destruction of his property &c. Expresses were dispatched with all possible speed to inform the Commander-in-Chief at Quebec, Lieutenant Colonel Bolton, commandant at Niagara, and Captain De Peyster, commandant at Michilimakinac. No time was lost in making preparations for executing the Orders of the Commander-in-Chief, should he approve of an attempt to dislodge the Rebels. Monsieur de Celoron was sent off directly for Ouiattanon, with Belts and Speeches for the Miamis Indians, and those of the River Ouabache, his Orders which were given him in writing, as was the case with all partizan Officers, directed that he should as soon as possible give me information of the dispositions of the Indians, the Numbers and if possible the views of the Rebels, and that he should not fail to have the few small Cannon at Fort Sackville spiked, and the Trunnions knocked off, a detail of his treacherous conduct I had the honor of laying before your Excellency in a letter from Ouiattanon. September 15th I had the honor of a letter from your Excellency, and in consequence wrote to Major de Peyster at Michilimakinac

HAMILTON'S REPORT 177 informing him of my design of attempting to dislodge the Rebels from the Ilinois. Having reviewed the Companies of Militia I found there would be as many of them turn out Volunteers as with the regulars La Mothe's Company, and the Indians, would employ what little Craft we had. Captn Lernoult who at that time commanded the detachment of the King's (8th) Regiment, assisted me greatly in forwarding everything necessary to be provided, and gave permission to Lieutenant Showrd, two Serjeants and thirty Rank & File who were all Volunteers to accompany me. Orders having been given in time for putting the carrying place at the Miamis in order, repairing the Carriages &c, proper artificers engaged, craft overhauled, and the weight of the provisions amuni- tion, stores, Indian Goods &c., calculated. The Indians being found well-disposed, and Messengers sent to the different Nations resorting to Detroit, apprizing them of my design, and exhorting them to send out frequent parties upon the Frontiers, the day was fix'd for our departure. Pere Potier the Jesuit missionary a man of a respectable charac- let and venerable figure, came to the head of our little encampment ºn the Common of Detroit, and having attended to the reading the Articles of War, and the renewal of the Oath of allegiance to His Britannick Majesty, he gave the blessing to the Catholics present, ºnditionally, upon their strictly adhering to their oath, being the more engaged thereto as the indulgence and favour of their prince, merited their best services and had exceeded their most sanguine ºpectations The subsequent behavior of these people has *casioned my recalling this circumstance. Our numbers (by recollection, as the Rebels got possession of the returns with other papers) were as follows—Of Regulars, one Lieutenant firworker two Matrosses—One Lieutenant 2 Serjeants, *Rank and file of the King's (8th) Regiment. Of Irregulars One Captain one Lieutenant 2 Serjeants 4 Rank & file—being Volun- *ts who had been disciplined in the best manner we could com- Pass for about one Year, about seventy Volunteers selected from The word is not quite clear.

On the 7th of October the various necessaries for a winter move- ment of 600 Miles being provided, by the activity and goodwill of Captains Lernoult and Grant the latter of whom had attended to everything afloat, and by the assistance of Major Hay and Mr. Fleming the Commissary, we struck our Tents and embarked with one Field peece which was all could be spared from the Garrison. One single person, he an Indian, was affected with liquor. We proceeded a little way down the River and encamp'd-I shall observe once for all, that camp duty was as strictly attended to, as the slender knowledge I possessed would admit, and that the Guards Picketts and advanced Centries, were regularly visited from the setting the watch, which was usually at sunset till broad daylight, that the boats were loaded, manned, and arranged in such a way as to be perfectly secured within our centries every night—That the Indians encamped and decamped, as regularly as could be wish'd, and that among them not a single Instance of drunkenness or quarrelling occurrd for 72 days, nor the least repining at the fatigues of the Journey, or the hardships of the season—Their customs in War, their ceremonies on the way, and what pass'd in the meetings with various tribes, with the Speeches, are enterd upon my diary, and may be of service to persons who wish to be acquainted with their forms without an attention to which, no hearty assistance is to be expected from them. On the 9th a snowstorm having subsided, it was debated whether or not we should hazard the passage of the Lake, from the Mouth of Detroit river, to that of the Miamis, but considering the ad- vanced Season, and that contrary winds or the freezing of the Lake would frustrate our design, I determined to make the Push. The traverse is of 36 miles and it was noon before the swell on the Lake was fallen sufficiently. The night proved extremely dark, the head boats with guides carryed lights for the direction of those astern, about 11 o'clock the wind shifted, it began to rain, a heavy swell roll'd in, we were on a lee shore and all was at stake, what I sufferd on this occasion may more readily be conceiv'd than express'd, after rowing some time we lay on our Oars with our sterns to the swell till we judged
Page 179
HAMILTON'S REPORT 179 the most distant boats could discern our lights, and then rowed in shore, when happily we made an ouzy beach within a mile of the entrance of the Miamis river—It blew so hard all night we could neither pitch a tent or make a fire, and yet were happy in our es- cape, for if providentially we had not passed an extent of rocky coast before the storm arose, we had all inevitably perish’d. This day Monsieur de Celeron met us on his return, he made his report aloud, that the rebels were already arrived at the Miamis, I affected indifference, tho' astonished at his imprudence, and said I had already heard of it. I orderd him to proceed to Detroit– it soon appeard that his design in giving that false intelligence was deliberately treacherous, as he had been industrious in passing the Indian settlements on the way to spread the alarm. I apprized the Commandant at Detroit by letter of this manége. On the 11th we arrived at the foot of the Rapids, where we found Captain Grant, who in the sloop Archangel had brought 14 tonns of provision to expedite our journey—The next day we lost Lieu- tenant Showrd' by the accident of his piece going off which shattered his leg, we sent the Surgeon with him in a light boat to Detroit, where he sufferd the amputation but a mortification ensuing he lost his life. - On the 24th we arrived at the Miamis town after the usual fatigues attending such a Navigation, the water being remarkably low. Here we met several tribes of the Indians previously sum- moned to meet here, and held several conferences, made them presents, and dispatched Messengers to the Shawanese, as well as the Nations on our route, inviting them to join us, or at least watch the motions of the Rebels upon the frontiers; for which purpose I sent them amunition. Having pass'd the portage of nine miles, we arrived at one of the sources of the Ouabache call'd the petite Riviere, the waters were so uncommonly low that we should not have been able to have pass'd, but that at the distance of 4 miles from the landing place the Beavers had made a dam which kept up the water, this we cut through to give a passage to our boats, and having taken in our lading at the landing pass'd all the boats. The Beavers are never molested at this place by the traders or Indians, and soon repair * May be “Shewrd.”
Page 180
180 ILLINOIS HISTORICAL COLLECTIONS their dam, which is a most serviceable work upon this difficult communication. With great labor we next pass'd a Swamp called les Volets, beyond which the little Riviere à Boéte joins the one we had made our way thro. The shallowness of the water obliged us to make a dam across both Rivers to back the water into the Swamp, and when we judged the Water to be sufficiently raised cut our Dyke and pass'd with all our craft. The same obstacle occurred at Riviere à l’Anglais, and the same work was to be raised. In our progress down the Ouabache difficulties encreased, the setting in of the frost lowerd the river, the floating ice cut the men as they worked in the water to haul the boats over shoals and rocks, our Batteau were damaged, and to be repeatedly unloaded, calked, and payd, 97,000 lbs. of provisions and stores to be carryed by the men, in which the Indians assisted chearfully, when the boats were to be lighten'd. It was sometimes a day's work to get the distance of half a league. It was necessary to stop frequently at the Indian Villages, to have conferences with them, furnish them with necessarys, and engage a few to accompany us. At length we got into a good depth of Water a fall of rain having raised the River, this advantage was succeeded by fresh difficultys the frost becom- ing so intense as to freeze the River quite across, however by hard labour we made our way, and now approaching within a few days' journey of St. Vincennes, our reconnoitring party brought in a Lieutenant and three Men, sent from Fort Sackville to gain intelli- gence. The Officer had in his pocket two commissions, one from Lieutenant Governor Abbott, the other from Colonel Clarke, and was in the pay of Congress—I gave their Arms to the Indians, but would not proceed rigorously with them, wishing to gain these people by lenity, and apprehensive, that an instance of severity might rouze the ferocity of the Indians which I wished of all things to avoid. Learning from the prisoners the state of things at St. Vincennes, I sent off parties to lay upon the roads from thence to the Ilinois, and to the falls on the Ohio, where the Rebels had a Fort, and a number of families lately come to settle, their Orders were to intercept any messengers, secure them and their letters, but not to suffer any violence to be offer'd to their persons, They executed their Orders and took prisoners, two men sent off by the Officer |-

HAMILTON'S REPORT 181 commanding for the Rebels at Fort Sackville with letters to Colonel Clarke acquainting him of our arrival. Major Hay was detach'd with orders to fall down the river, and Send to the principal Inhabitants of St. Vincennes, acquainting them that unless they quitted the Rebels and laid down their Arms, there was no mercy for them, some chiefs accompanied him to Conciliate the Peankashaa Indians residing at St. Vincennes, and to show the French what they might expect if they pretended to resist. Major Hay secured the Arms, ammunition, and spiritous liquors, as soon as the inhabitants laid down their Arms, and the Officer who commanded in the Fort (Captain Helm) being deserted by the Officers and Men who to the Number of 70 had form'd his Garrison, and were in pay of the Congress surrender'd his wretched forton the very day of our arrival being the 17th of December 1778. Thus we employ'd 71 days in coming only Six hundred Miles, which is to be attributed to the extraordinary difficulties of the way owing to an uncommon drought; the severity of the season, and the inevitable delays at the Indian Villages, particularly at Ouiattanon, where the Chiefs who had receiv'd the Rebel colors came in to us from their hunting, acknowledged their error gave up the flags and accused Monsieur de Celoron of having deserted them, besides that he never distributed to them the goods entrusted to him for the Indians. In the fort we found two iron three pounders, mounted on truck carriages, two swivels not mounted, a very small quantity of amunition, and thirty two stout Horses which had been purchased for Congress, and which I gave to the Indians. As to the state of the fort we found it a miserable stockade, without a Well, barrack, platform for small arms, or even a lock to the gate. Such was the moderation and good order observed by the Indians, that not a single person had the slenderest cause of complaint, not a shot was fired nor any inhabitant injured in person or property. It is remarkable that tho on our arrival at this place our number was encreased to 500 Men, there was not one sick, nor had there been a single instance of drunkenness among the Indians or soldiery from the day we left Detroit, tho’

Page 182
1S2 ILLINOIS HISTORICAL COLLECTIONS rum was deliver'd out on every occasion when the fatigues or bad weather made it necessary. As soon as proper precautions were taken for securing our boats, landing our provisions &c", it became a point of consideration whether we should proceed directly to attack the Rebels at the Ilinois, or content ourselves with establish- ing ourselves in this post where we had these several advantages; the command of the River Ohio by which the Spaniards had supplyed the Rebel forts with Powder &c., the cutting off the communication between the Ilinois, and the falls of Ohio across the country—The being situated so as to check the River Indians, and encourage the Delawares and Ottawas on white River, further to divide our small force (since we must leave a Garrison in Fort Sackville) appear'd not eligible, and we could not expect the Indians to remain much longer with us. The state of our provi- sions, the length of the journey (240 miles) and the want of Carriages, added to the nature of the country, subject to innun- dations all combined to direct our determination to fortify ourselves here, and wait for reinforcements in the Spring. On taking an account of the Inhabitants at this place of all ages and sexes we found their number to amount to 621, of this 217 fit to bear arms, on the spot, several being absent hunting Buffaloe for their winter provision. Having summon'd the Inhabitants to assemble in the Church. I went to meet them, reproach'd them with their treachery and ingratitude, but told them since they had laid down their arms and sued for protection, that on renewing their Oath of Allegiance they should be secured in their persons and property. Lenity I thought might induce the French inhabitants at Kaskaskias to follow their example, tho' the conduct of the Canadians at large was but poor encouragement. I read twice to them the Oath prepared for them to take, explain'd the nature of it, and cautioned them against that levity they had so recently given proof of. The oath being administer'd, they severally kiss'd a silver crucifix at the foot of the Altar, after which they sign'd their names to a paper containing the same Oath in writing. It was conceived in the following terms.

184 ILLINOIS HISTORICAL COLLECTIONS 2 I am persuaded, have acted to our wish. Messengers were sent to Mr. Stewart' the agent for Indian affairs to the Southward, with Letters proposing a meeting in the Spring at St. Vincennes, or the Cherokee River, the object of which was to reconcile the Southern Indians with the Shawanese and other Northern Nations, and to concert a general invasion of the frontier. A Letter was also sent for Captain Blomer at the Natchez by a person who I expected would betray his trust, and shew it to Don Bernardo de Galvez at New Orleans. A party of 30 Men with an Officer was sent to the Mouth of the Ouabache to intercept any boats that might be sent up the Ohio- as soon as Indian Parties return'd, others supplied their Places, and so well did they execute what was recommended to them, that they did at different times bring in prisoners and prevent intelligence being carried from St. Vincennes to the Ilinois, till the desertion of a Corporal and six men of La Mothe's company in the latter end of January, who gave the first intelligence to Colonel Clarke of our arrival. As the Corporal and some of the Men had hitherto behaved well, it was apprehended that they were moved to desert by ill- intentioned people among the French at St. Vincennes. One of the deserters was brother to Gibault the priest, who had been an active Agent for the Rebels, and who's vicious and immoral conduct was sufficient to do infinite mischief in a Country where ignorance and bigotry give full scope to the depravity of a licentious ecclesias- tic. This wretch it was who absolved the French inhabitants from their Allegiance to the King of Great Britain. To enumerate the Vices of the Inhabitants would be to give a long catalogue, but assert that they are not in possession of a single virtue, is no more than truth, and justice require, still the most eminently vicious and scandalous was the reverend Monsieur Gibault. The several Nations of Indians inhabiting the banks of the Ouabache came in at different times; made great professions, and declared their distrust of the Virginians, but there was but one Chief with his party who really acted with zeal and spirit, tho’ the lake Indians shewed them a very good example. An Ottawa chief in particular soon after our arrival at St. Vincennes offer'd "The word is blotted. The final letter is either “t" over “4” or vice versa.

The Major, Le gras, and one of the Captains, Bosseron, with several of the Private Men being reported absent, I suspected treachery, the two Officers however made their appearance at sunset. About 5 minutes after candles had been lighted we were alarmed by hearing a Musquet discharged; presently aftersomemore, I concluded that some party of Indians was return'd or that there was some riotous frolic in the Village, going upon the Parade to enquire I heard the Balls whistle, order'd the Men to the Blockhouses, forbidding them to fire till they perceived the shot to be directed against the Fort. We were shortly out of suspence, one of the serjeants receiving a shot in the breast. The fire was now return'd, but the enemy had a great advantage from their Rifles, and the cover of the Church, Houses, Barns, &c. Mr. McBeath the surgeon having been in the Village when the firing began, push'd to get to the Gate, and narrowly escaped being kill'd, he reported that as soon as the first shots were fired, the Woman of the house where he was told him that Colonel Clarke was arrived with 500 Men from the Ilinois. This very house had lately been scarched in the night on suspicion of a stranger being conceald, but the serjeant and party could not discover any such person—Tho' the night was dark we had a Serjeant Matross and five Men wounded. The weather was still so cold we were obliged to bring the Wounded into our own quar- ters. The Officers who had continued in tents all the winter were exposed to the fire of the enemy's riflemen as the picketting of the Fort was so poorly set up that one might pass the hand clench'd, between the Stockades. We dislodged the enemy from the Church, and nearest houses by a few cannon shot from the Blockhouses, but when day appeared and we saw that the Inhabitants of the Village had joined the Rebels, we despaired of Captain La Mothe's party regaining the fort, but to our great surprize and joy about half-an-hour before sunrise they appear'd and got into the Fort over the Stockades which were upright, and 11 feet out of the ground, with their Arms in their hands. Two Canadians of his

The firing was but slack after sunrise, and about 8 o'clock a flag of truce from the Rebels appear'd, carried by Nicolas Cardinal a Captain of the Militia of St. Vincennes, who deliver'd me a Letter from Coll Clarke requiring me to surrender at discretion, adding With an Oath that if I destroy'd any Stores or Papers I should be **ted as a murtherer.

Lieutenant-Governor Hamilton engages to deliver up to Colonel Clarke, Fort Sackville as it is at present with all the Stores, ammu- nition and provision, reserving only thirty-six rounds of powder & ball per man, and as many weeks' provision, as shall be sufficient to subsist those of the garrison who shall go by land or by Water to their destination which is to be agreed on hereafter. The garrison are to deliver themselves up prisoners of War, and to march out with their Arms, accoutrements and Knapsacks. A Guide or Guides to be given, with a safeguard to escort the Garrison to their destination, as also horses for the transport of provision, provided the Garrison marches by land.

HAMILTON Before anything was concluded the following scene was exhibi- ted, of which I give your Excellency a relation, as it serves to contrast the behaviour of His Majesty's Subjects with that of the Rebels, so often celebrated for humanity, generosity, and indeed everything virtuous, elevated, and noble.

Page 189
HAMILTON'S REPORT 189 2. About 2 o'clock afternoon a party of Indians with some whites return'd from a Scout, with two Canadians whom they had taken prisoners near the falls of Ohio, probably with information for the Rebels at the Fort. Colonel Clarke sent off a detachment of 70 Men against them. The Indian party was 15 or 16 Men, who Seeing the English Flag flying at the Fort, discharged their pieces, an usual compliment with those people, they were immediately fired upon by the Rebels and Canadians, two killed on the spot, One shot in the belly, who however escaped, the rest were surround- "d and taken bound to the Village, where being set in the Street Wººsite the Fort Gate they were put to death, notwithstanding attuce at that moment existed. The manner (as related to me by iſerent people, and among others by the man at whose door this ºrable feat was perpetrated) was as follows— One of them was tomahawk'd immediately. The rest sitting ºn the ground in a ring bound—seeing by the fate of their comrade *at they had to expect, the next on his left sung his death song, *d was in turn tomahawk'd, the rest underwent the same fate, * Only was saved at the intercession of a Rebel Officer, who ºaded for him telling Coll Clarke that the Savages' father had ºrmerly spared his life. The Chief of this party after having had the hatchet stuck in his *d, took it out himself and deliver'd it to the inhuman monster who struck him first, who repeated his stroke a second and a third * after which the miserable spectacle was dragged by the rope *this neck to the River, thrown in, and suffer'd to spend still six moments of life in fruitless struglings—Two serjeants who had been Volunteers with the Indians escaped death by the inter- ºn of a father and a Sister who were on the spot. Mr. Francis Maisonville whom I formerly mentioned was set in a Chair, and º Col. Clarke's order a Man came with a scalping knife, who eaſing to proceed to this excess of barbarity on a defenceless º Colonel Clarke with imprecations told him to proceed, º a. piece of the scalp had been raised the man stopp'd his c. ** again order'd to proceed, and as the executor of Coll Mhº: Was 111 the act of raising the Skin, a brother of Mr. ºn Coll c. who had. joined the Rebels, step'd up and prevailed rke to desist. The poor man who survived this cruel
Page 190
190 ILLINOIS HISTORICAL COLLECTIONS treatment, and shew'd an unshaken firmness in the minute of impending death, was not afterwards proof to the long confine- ment he underwent at Williamsburg, the gloominess of his situation affected his spirits first, the apprehension of suffering an ignomin- ious death lower'd them still more, till his reason began to be impair’d—The surgeon, a Man of great humanity, tho' attached to the cause of Rebellion, wrote to the Governor and Council of Virginia to solicit a little enlargement for this poor man, as the only means likely to save him, what the answer was I know not, but the unfortunate creature put an end to his miseries and his life, in spight of two persons who watched him and were aware of his situation. Colonel Clarke yet reeking with the blood of these unhappy Victims' came to the Esplanade before the Fort Gate, where I had agreed to meet him and treat of the surrender of the Garrison— He spoke with rapture of his late achievement, while he washed off the blood from his hands stained in this inhuman sacrifice. He told me it was in vain to think of persisting in the defence of the Fort, that his cannon would be up in a few hours, that he knew to a Man who might be depended on with every other cir- cumstance of my situation, that if from a spirit of obstinacy I persisted when there was no probability of relief and should stand an Assault, not a single Soul should be spared. I replyed that tho' my numbers were small I could depend on them, He said he knew I had but 35 or 36 staunch men, that 'twas but folly to think of a defence with so small numbers so overmatch'd; that if I would surrender at discretion and trust to his generosity, I should have better treatment than if I artcled [sic] for terms—my answer was, that I would then abide the consequence, and never take so disgracefull a step while I had ammunition and provision. You will be answerable (said he) for the lives lost by your obstinacy. I said my Men had declared they would die with Arms in their hands rather than surrender at discretion, that still I would accept such terms as might consist with my honor and duty, that knowing what I could pretend to, little time was neces- sary for drawing up Articles—He said he would think upon it and return in half-an-hour, he returned accordingly accompanied by * See Introduction, ante, lxxxiv.

HAMILTON'S REPORT 191 One of his Captains—I went to meet them with Major Hay, the Soldiers in the meantime apprehensive of some ill design, mannd the East Blockhouse ready to fire at an instant. . The conversation was resumed, and Colonel Clarke appeared as determined as before, I then said further discourse was vain, that I would return to the Fort and to prevent mistakes, the firing should not take place ioſ an hour after our parting took my leave & was proceeding to the fort, when Major Hay & Captain Bowman call'd me back, the Subject was renewed, and Coll Clarke agreed to my sending terms ior his consideration—They were sent that same evening, Colonel Clarke made his alterations and I agreed to them, having first called the Officers together, and exposed to them the necessity of the step. The Men were then assembled, and were convinced that no advantage to His Majesty's service could result from our holding out in the present circumstances. - Among reasons not mentioned on the face of the capitulation Were the treachery of one-half our little garrison, the certainty ºf the Inhabitants of the Village having joyned the Rebels—The North-East Angle of the fort projecting over a sandbank already considerably undermined, the miserable state of the wounded Men, the impossibility of effecting an escape by water, while the half of our number had shewed their poltronnerie and treason, and ºur wounded must be left at the mercy of a mercyless set of Banditti. Having given the necessary orders, I pass'd the night in sorting º and in preparing for the disagreable ceremony of the next ay. Mortification, disappointment, and indignation had their turns.

102 ILLINOIS HISTORICAL COLLECTIONS Clarke a written account of Cruelties exercised by us while at St. Vincennes, which our own American prisoners confuted in their Accounts to Coll Clarke. Thus by the baseness and ingratitude of people who owed their lives and properties to us, we were betrayed into the hands of our enemies. Permit me Sir to make a slight digression, and attempt to show that a Correspondence with the french inhabit- ants, and not to our supineness and neglect, The Rebels owed the information necessary for accomplishing their design. On our arrival at St. Vincennes a strict search was made for Gunpowder, all that was to be found in the place was put into the Magazine, and a heavy fine was laid on those who should be found to conceal any, nevertheless Colonel Clarke was supplyed by the Inhabitants, his own to the last ounce being damaged on his March. He himself told me that he should never have attempted to attack us but that he was minutely informed of our situation in every respect. The Indians who after a march in winter of seventy-one days had acted with great zeal and fidelity, and furnish'd as many parties as I wish'd, had almost all return'd to their homes—Two Com- panies of Volunteers from Detroit had testy fied so much uneasiness, and unwillingness to remain that I chose to send them away rather than keep them against their inclination—Several persons who had been on pay as partisans with the Indians I believe fomented this discontent, which I attributed to their surmizing that France would join the Americans—Those people I discharged and sent away—The conduct of the canadians in general has shewn that no ties that have force upon enlightened and generous minds, can bind them, and that they prefer any subjection, to the freedom of Englishmen. The artfull manége of the inhabitants of the Ilinois is not to be forgot—When news was carried to that place of the Indians coming against them under my orders, the young men offer'd their service to Coll Clarke to bear arms against the English, but their Fathers & uncles told him they had sworn allegiance to the King of great Britain, therefore could not act the same part, but that they would not fight against the Americans.

Our Soldiers told us that some of the Rebels had sworn solemnly to destroy Major Hay and myself the first oppertunity. As We could not guard against any attempt in the situation we then found ourselves, we thought it best to appear unacquainted with any such resolution, but we were twice in the night obliged to fly for security to Coll Clarke's quarters in the fort, two men that were intoxicated and who's names had been given us, attempt- ing to shoot us in our tent—The attempt was proved but no punishment ensued. We were kept in the dark as to the day of our departure, tho’ I had repeatedly ask'd it, that we might have bread baked and prepare what was necessary. - On the 5th of March, Monsieur Dejean was brought in prisoner, along with Monsieur Adhemar, the latter had been sent up with ten pirogues and thirty men to the Miamis, to bring down provi- sions and stores which had been forwarded from Detroit, Mr. Dejean had obtained leave of the Commandant there to pass to St. Vincennes, and had taken Charge of letters from Detroit for me—The day before Captain Helm (an American Officer Who commanded the party sent to take the convoy) arrived at Ouiat- tanon Mr. Dejean heard that we had fallen into the hands of \\\e Rebels, but he had not sufficient presence of mind to destroy the papers which with everything else were seized by the Rebels.

Our Surgeon was robbed of his medicines and instruments Coli Clarke being arbiter of that article of the Capitulation by which the Officers were to take their necessary baggage. At length on the 8th day of March, we were put into a heavy Oak boat, being 27 in Number, with our provision of Flour and pork at common ration, and 14 Gallons of Spirits for us and our guard which consisted of 23 persons including two officers—We had before us 360 Miles of water carriage and 840 to march to the place of our destination Williamsburgh in Virginia—The 10th in the afternoon we reach'd the Ohio, whose Waters were out in an uncommon and astonishing degree—The depth above the banks (8 feet with such a swift current as made it very fatiguing to row which we all did in turn while our guard were distributed in four fight boats—At night we were obliged to lye in our boat making it fast to a tree, for the flood extended as far in the wood as the Eye *ld reach, we made a miserable shift with our mast and oars to throw a (not legible] over head to keep out the rain, and lay like *ine close jammed together having not room to extend ourselves.

Our guard however behaved very well, protected us and hunted for us else we must have starved for our rations were long since expended and our allowance of bears flesh and Indian meal was frequently very scanty–The people at the forts are in a wretched state, obliged to enclose their cattle every night within the fort, and carry their rifle to field when they go to plow or cut wood. On our long march we had frequently hunger and thirst to en- counter as well as fatigue, at length we gained the settled Country and at Lynches ferry on James River, were put into canoes and continued our progress by Water. On the 20th of May being on shore to get refreshment we were agreeably surprized to find ourselves at Brigadier Hamiltons quarters, who endeavored by his kindness and hospitality to make us forget our hardships—The same evening halting at the house of a Rebel Colonel Lewis, we had the good fortune to See two Officers of the convention Army, Captain Freeman aid de camp to General Reidesel was so obliging as to be the bearer of a Letter from me to General Philips, as also one for your Excellency containing the Capitulation and some returns—On the 26th A Rebel Captain with a Guard marched us from Beaver dam to Richmond, from thence to Chesterfield, where we remain'd till the 15th June, on which day an Officer having a written order under the hand of the Governor of the Province Thomas Jefferson for taking me in Irons to Williamsburgh.

Your Excellency will I hope pardon me for giving a copy of the paper which I gave to the Goaler the day before, and which he return'd to me with the greatest insolence of contempt, telling me that dignified Characters in that Country were not to be treated with so little ceremony—It was worded as follows— MR. PELHAM— “Having understood from you yesterday that the Governor was “gone to the Country to stay for a month, I request of you to “wait on the Lieutenant Governor, present my respects to him, ac- “quainting him, that by a written order sign'd by the Governor, “I with Mr. Dejean and Captain La Mothe have been ironed & “thrown into a dungeon where we have now lain upwards of 40 “days—That we have not been inform'd of the cause of this treat- “ment—we do not hear of our being to be confronted with our “accusers, we hear no mention of any public enquiery, we suffer “without any trial: We understand that these proceedings are “not agreeable to the Laws of this Province, or to any known “rule of equity, that it is inconsistent with the tenor of the Gov- “ernors Oath, and breathes the genuine spirit of lettres de căchet “in the most arbitrary government—The Governor's departure, “without bestowing a thought on men in our situation, shews, that “we may suffer in reputation, health and loss of time, with as “little prospect of redress, as if we were in the cells of the inquisi- “tion—Mr. Pelham please to inform the Lieutenant Governor, “that I do not think common justice to be less the birthright of “every man, than the enjoyments of light & liberty, but that

Having been by order of the Governor (with the advice of his Council) prohibited the use of pen Ink and paper, or the con- verse of any one but our Jailor we had no employment but in our reflections, at length the prisoners in the next cell contrived to thrust the Newspapers thro a hole and in them we found the formal charge drawn up against us entirely unsupported by truth or evidence—I have the honor to enclose to your Excellency copies of their publications—The day after our confinement the jailor came to ask me for my Keys, which having deliver'd my box was search'd, and such papers as would have disproved their assertions, taken out, however as I had had many proofs of the disingenious part these people were capable of acting, I had hid my journal, with copies of usefull papers, which I have found means to pre- serve, tho our place and mode of confinement were so often changed. August 31st—Major Hay with the other Prisoners from Ches- terfield arrived at Williamsburgh, the Soldiers were confined in the debtors room, the officers 5 in Number were put into the Dungeon with us which made the heat intolerable At eleven at night we were obliged to alarm the prisoners in the next cell who pass'd the word to the Guard for the Jailor, our Surgeon being on the point of suffocating an asthma to which he was Subject having seized him at this time with that violence, that he lost his pulse for ten minutes, we had tried by wafting a Blanket to draw some air thro' the grate but this was insufficient and if he had not had presence cnough of mind to open a vein, he would probably have expired, for the state of the air was such that a Candle with which we had lately been indulged, would barely live if held at the top of the Cell.

The door of our Cell continuing shut for several days, the poor prisoners Young and old, Men and Women, offered to be lock'd up and debarr'd the use of the court, if we might be allow'd that liberty, which at length we had The Humanity and attention of these poor people is not to be forgot, they offer'd themselves to do a hundred kind offices, cleand and wash'd our Cell, shew'd us how to manage our Irons, Wrapped them round with rags, offer'd to saw them off whenever means of escape offer'd, but what struck me most was, that when We were indulged with the use of the court and sat to eat, these people always withdrew—Gratitude calls on me to mention the difference of Characters we experienced from the leaders in this Country, and those subjected to their controul. Being attack'd with a fit of the Gout a Surgeon was sent for who treated me with the greatest tenderness—by his means my fetters were taken off, and handcuffs put on, but these were little restraint, for as I had fallen away considerably, I could slip my hands thro them with ease. Other persons persuaded of the falsehood and infamy of the charges laid against us found means to convey to us intelligence, and what was still more acceptable, sometimes a loaf of bread, meat, vegetables fruit &c. and this at their great peril–On our first arrival a person came who proposed to furnish us provision at four pounds per man of their paper Money per day. General Philips knowing our situation had sent us an unlimited credit, and his letter having passed to us thro' the hands of the Governor and Council we for a time lived plentifully and had the means of helping out the miserable ration of the prisoners, but after a while the executive power order'd our purveyor to limit our allowance, and at length after we had rejected the parole he was forbid to furnish us any longer, so that in the depth of a Winter the severest ever known in this country, we had water alone for drink, and our provision was bread of Indian meal and very poor salted Becſ. October 1st-A Parole was tenderd to us which having read and duly considered we all rejected, as some people thought a

I do promise on my parole of honor, that I will not depart out of the limits which shall from time to time be prescribed to me by the Governor of the Commonwealth of Virginia, or any other person having Authority from him to prescribe or alter such limits —That I will not say or do anything directly or indirectly to the prejudice of the united States of America or any of them. That I will hold no conference with any prisoners of War, other than those fix’d at the same quarters with me, but in the presence of such person as the Governor or some one acting by authority from him shall appoint, nor send nor receive any letter or message, nor communicate any intelligence to or from any person but with the privity and permission of the Governor, or other person authorized by him for that purpose, to whom all letters or other papers coming to my hands shall be deliverd before their Seals shall be broken, or they shall be otherwise opened: and this promise which I make on the faith of a Gentle. man shall be binding on me untill I shall be enlarged from my captivity by exchange or otherwise with the consent of the Governor of Virginia.

HAMILTON'S REPORT 203 had experienced the inhumanity of the executive power, It plainly appeard that this parole was offer'd from no other motive than to lay us open to the malice of the first informer, when we should probably have been imprisoned as before, with the additional Stigma of having broken a parole, which it was next to impossible to observe in all its parts. October the 9th The Soldiers were sent from the Jail to the Barrack, where being allowed to cut wood a part was sent to the Jail for us, and even the American soldiers on guard, tho’ miserably bare of clothing themselves, used to spare a part of their own fuel for the dressing our victuals. On Christmas Day the Soldiers were march'd away to King William County—The weather at this time became so intensely cold, that we could not rise from the floor but continued day and might in our blankets, The scurvy began to make it's appearance, and our legs to swell—The Jailor then concluding we could not survive the severity of the cold in our present situation, took us to an upper room in the Jail, where prisoners had formerly been kept, this tho it had no window but an open grate was more tolerable than the Dungeon, we could light fire in the Chimney and by sacrificing part of our blankets to stop the grated window and stuff the cracks in the cieling we made a shift to endure in the daytime, at night were remanded to our Dungeon. April 18th. 1780 Lieutenant Schieffelin made his escape, in Company with Monsieur De Rochblave and after great risques and difficulties got to New York. June 1st—Mr. Maisonville destroyd himself. August 1st–We were march'd from Williamsburgh—Major Hay and I sent to the Jail at Chesterfield—the Surgeon and Mr. Bellefeuille to King William Court-House—Captn La Mothe and Mr. Dejean some time in last October accepted the parole formerly rejected, the former went to Hanover, the latter went to Coll Clarke but what is become of him, I have not since learn'd. Some time in September a second parole was offer'd for our consideration which varied so little from the first that we chose to remain prisoners rather than accept it—While at Chesterfield our confinement was rendered very tolerable, and several of the

He had had hopes of procuring an Exchange, and got permis- sion to come to virginia to effect it if practicable—He brought me letters from my friends at York which gave me to understand, that unless I accepted a Parole, there was little probability of my procuring an exchange—Having therefore Written to Brigadier Hamilton to request the continuance of his kindness to the prison- ers now removed to Frederic Town–I with Major Hay accepted the parole following– I Henry Hamilton Lieutenant Governor and Superintendant of Detroit hereby acknowledge myself a prisoner of War to the Commonwealth of Virginia, and having permission from His Excellency Thomas Jefferson, Governor of the said Common- wealth to go to New York, do pledge my faith and most sacred promise upon my parole of honor, that I will not do, say, write, or cause to be done said or written, directly or indirectly, in any respect whatsoever anything to the prejudice of the united States of America, or any of them, untill I shall be enlarged from my Captivity by exchange or otherwise with the consent of the said Governor of Virginia or his successors, & that I will return when required by the said Governor or his successors, to such place within the said Commonwealth, as he shall point out, and deliver myself up again to him or the person acting for or under him. In testimony whereof, I have hereunto set my hand and Scal at Chesterfield this 10th day of October 1780 HENRY HAMILTON (L. S.) The within mentioned Henry Hamilton, having sign'd a Parole of which this is a copy, has permission to go to Now York, and

Given under my hand and Seal of the Commonwealth of Virginia at Richmond, date within written. (L.S.) TH. JEFFERSON Having accepted this Parole we hasten'd to Williamsburg in our way to Hampton, and there were stopped by the Lt. Gover- nor, who as General Leslie had just arrived thought it not ad- viseable to let us pass, and gave orders for our being escorted back to Richmond—This treatment I resented telling them they might march me back prisoner, but that this was a step they might judge imprudent in the present Juncture. They seemd to think so, for we had liberty to proceed—As soon as I had given certificates, recommending to General Leslie such of the inhabitants as had shewn an attachment to Government, or had been kind to us in our distress, we proceeded to York, where some turbulent people were minded to set a guard over us and stop our progress, at length we got to Hampton—This short journey cost us one thousand pounds, such was the depreciated State of the paper Money at that time. - At Hampton people were civil to us furnish’d us with a cannoe, which to our inexpressible satisfaction put us on board His Ma- jesty's Sloop Delight, Captain Inglis, who by his kind reception of us presently recruited our lower'd spirits—We next went to wait on Captain Gayton Commander of the squadron—The cartel Vessel which was to have conveyed us from Hampton to New York, had been taken and the masters certificate not ap- pearing genuine, he with the Vessel were detain'd. Having paid our Respects to General Leslie who received us with the greatest politeness, we returned to the Romulus, Cap- tain Gayton's ship—The Cartel Master was suffer'd to go to Hampton to prepare for his Voyage. The Stores which General Leslie and Captain Gayton had most liberally supplied us were plunder'd by the Americans on shore for we did not choose to
Page 206
206 ILLINOIS HISTORICAL COLLECTIONS J risque ourselves out of a King's Ship—At length we set of from the Romulus in our Cartel, a little miserable sloop of 36 feet keel, for a passage in which we were obliged to pay four hundred hard dollars—A Violent gale of wind obliged us to Anchor of Smith's Islands, where we were very near perishing, our crew was three hours at work to get the Anchor out of the ground, at last we got it home leaving one flook behind, and to our no small mortification were obliged to put back to Hampton—Here we were on the point of being detain’d by Order of General Nelson, who had assembled some Militia, but our Skipper being desirous to get away, and having got another Anchor, we once more set sail for New York. A very severe Gale of wind took us near the Capes of Dela- ware when our skipper not having a log line on board laid the vessel to, and we had reason in the morning to admire our good fortune, for the wind was right on Shore, and it was 12 at night when he lay to, judging by the run—that we were opposite Dela- ware Bay, as it proved for we had driven seven leagues up the Bay from the time of laying to. We arrived at New York very squalid Spectacles, not having had any sleep for 3 days and nights, our Cloths ragged, Shoes broken and so alter'd in face and figure that our acquaintance could scarcely recollect us—His Excellency Sir Henry Clinton, Major General Philips, Lord Rawdon were so good as to take several steps towards procuring our Exchange, which finally took place on the 4th day of March 1781, we took our passage for England the 10th, but the packet not sailing till the 27th of May our arrival in this Country was so late as the 21st June. Thus Sir I have attempted to give your Excellency some ac- count of my unfortunate failure, with the causes of it which while I lament I must attribute chiefly, if not entirely, to the treachery of persons, whom I had reason to expect, Lenity and moderation would have gained, and whose interest it was to be faithfull. Among those to be raised for this service, there was but little choice, the Arts of some rebel emisaries, and the [in]trigues of per- sons still attach'd to the Interest of France got the better of the good intentions the Canadians might have set out with. 1 May possibly be “Nilson."

I plainly saw that they would work there own Ruin as the greatest Security they had for the Cuntrey would be that of making it the Interest of the people to support their claim and that by their Conduct they would shortly exasperate the people and that would be the Moment to overset them.

At Louisville the sun must have been four-fifths or even nine-tenths covered about nine o'clock in the morning.

308 ILLINOIS HISTORICAL COLLECTIONS Mr Hay's last letters; when one Isadore Chaine (an Interpreter) and two Hurons arrived from Post Vincennes with the unfortunate news of that place having been retaken by Colonel Clarke, the Governor and whole party made prisoners, except himself, who made his escape with difficulty. This most unlucky stroke, with the arrival of a large body of Virginians advancing towards St. Dustrie' has greatly damped the spirits of the Indians. The chiefs from St. Dustrie are come in here with John Montour' to claim Governor Hamilton's promises to assist them; they declare, if a large detachment with cannon are not sent without delay from below, they must go out of the way, being not able to fight the enemy alone. As the loss of this Post opens a new road for the Virginians to this place by the Miamis River, I hope a strong re- inforcement will be sent here from Niagara by return of the vessels —at least what they can convey—as the new work is not yet defensible requiring many hands. The Canadians, exceedingly assuming on our bad success and weakness, not one of them will lend a hand. Spades, shovels, &c. are much wanted—also amunition as prenclosed returns: above 30,000 lbs of Flour of last years allowance not as yet sent here, with other species in proportion, and the enormous quantity consumed in the last unfortunate expedition, has reduced us greatly. Pray forward it. The Indians insist on having provisions sent to them, or they must be starved. The loss of Governor Hamilton is a most feeling one to me: I find the burthen heavy without assistance. It requires, I conies, superior abilities, and a better constitution. I will do my best, however. I beg leave to repeat to you the necessity of a reinforcement being sent, as the consequences may be fatal. I send the Felicity with this pacquet, which, with the Angelica, already down, will convey part of the Troops, as some of the Indian Chiefs wait the ‘Name commonly used for Sandusky. It was a noted trade center in the Wyandot country. * John Montour was the son of Andrew Montour, the noted half-breed interpreter who accompanied Washington on his western expedition, 1754. John was educated in Philadelphia at the expense of the state. He was re- garded as a friend to the American cause and in 1782, was granted a captain's commission. This letter, however, seems to indicate that confidence in him was misplaced. See Darlington, Christopher Gist's Journals, 167 et seq.

Tell them in my name that I am as good a father as warrior and that if they exhaust my patience, they shall hear from me, if there are still some who wish to be mad, I warn them to arm themselves strongly for they will be unfortunate if they fail to do so. I have soldiers who are not afraid and who are also mad. I could not perhaps stop them myself, for they want only war and ask only to fight. Thus I repeat again that the savages be quiet. I do not wish them to fight either for or against me. If they have closed ears let them be pierced; have them told or tell them

State Archives.—Copy.] KASKASKAs June 12 1779 DEAR SIR Yesterday I received your Letter by Mr Mantonis dated 26 February. I am under many obligations to you for the advice from Pensicola and many other favors, a strong reinforcement to Florida is what has been for some time expected by us, from their Maneuvers about the Center of the American Shore. I shall Immediately send Copys of your Letters to me with my Oppinion thereon to the seat of Government. what measures they may take I do not know an Expidition was Intended against the Floridays on the Mississippi but I am now convinced that it is out of the Question without a greater force but I do not think (Although I suppose for the sake of a Breathing spell they have Crouded themselves in the most remote Corner of the Continant for that purpose) that they will be suffered to Enjoy their Peace long, for the Warr on our side has changed from a Defensive to an Offensive one. I have little or no news to Inform you of Mº Lindsay the Bearer of this Letter is a Gentleman of variaty and lately from the Settlements will give you the whole. You mentioned your writing to me the 15 February. I can heare nothing of the Letter nor by whom sent I have never received the scrape of a Pen from you before Except by Lieu'. Harrison. I am sorry to learn you have not been supplyed with funds as Expected your protesting my late Bills has not surprized me.' as I Expected it being Sur- rounded by Enemies M. Hamilton & his Savages being obligated for my own safety to lay in Considerable Stores. I was oblidged to take every step I possibly could to procure them unwilling to use force &c. I believe In order to get Bills on you they Refused to receive a Coppers worth of Continental money so that I expect by this time they are sorry that they Attempted to deceive me. * Clark's drafts on Pollock were accepted by the latter but, since he had nº funds, many were not paid. There is preserved the protest by a St. Louis merchant, Joseph Perrault, concerning such notes, amounting to 2277 piastres, made in Kaskaskia on June 24, 1779. It may be that Clark refers to these notes, and others like them, for the knowledge of Pollock's failure to pay must have reached Kaskaskia some days before such a formal step, as a legal protest was made. See Alvord, Kaskaškia Records (I. H. C., v.), 98.

The Board proceeded to the consideration of the letters of Colonel Clarke, and other papers relating to Henry Hamilton, Esq. who has acted some years past as Lieutenant Governour of the settlement at and about Detroit, and commandant of the British garrison there, under Sir Guy Carleton as Governour in Chief; Philip Dejean, Justice of the Peace for Detroit, and William Lamothe, Captain of volunteers, prisoners of war, taken in the County of Illinois. They find that Governour Hamilton has executed the task of "citing the Indians to perpetrate their accustomed cruelties on he citizens of these states, without distinction of age, sex, or °ndition, with an eagerness and activity which evince that the *neral nature of his charge harmonized with his particular dis- Pºsition; they should have been satisfied from the other testi- mony adduced that these enormities were committed by savages acting under his commission, but the number of proclamations which at different times were left in houses, the inhabitants of *hich were killed or carried away by the Indians, one of which * *.statement on Lieutenant-Governor Hamilton, see Introduction, ante, "ii.

338 ILLINOIS HISTORICAL COLLECTIONS proclamations, under the hand and seal of Governour Hamilton, is in possession of the Board, puts this fact beyond doubt. At the time of his captivity it appears, that he had sent considerable detachments of Indians against the frontier settlements of the states, and had actually appointed a great council of Indians to meet him at the mouth of the Tanissee, to concert the operations of this present campaign. They find that his treatment of our citizens and soldiers, captivated and carried within the limits of his command, has been cruel and inhumane; that in the case of John Dodge," a citizen of these states, which has been particularly stated to this Board, he loaded him with irons, threw him into a dungeon, without bedding, without straw, without fire, in the dead of winter and severe climate of Detroit; that in that state he harrassed and wasted him, with incessant expectations of death; that when the rigours of his situation had brought him so low that death seemed likely to withdraw him from their power, he was taken out and attended to till somewhat mended, and then again, before he had recovered abilities to walk, was returned to his dungeon, in which a hole was cut seven inches square only, for the admission of air, and the same load of irons again put on him; that appearing again to be in imminent danger of being lost to them, he was a second time taken from his dungeon, in which he had lain from January to June, with the intermission before mentioned of a few weeks only; that Governour Hamilton gave standing rewards for scalps, but offered none for prisoners, which induced the Indians, after making their captives carry their baggage into the neighbourhood of the fort, there to put them to death, and carry in their scalps to the Governour, who welcomed 1 John Dodge printed a pamphlet entitled: An Entertaining Narratite ºf the cruel and barbarous Treatment and extreme Sufferings of Mr. John Dodge during his captivity etc. (Danvers, 1780). This has been recently reprinted by C. M. Burton of Detroit. For the history of John Dodge consult the indexes of Alvord, Cahokia Records and Kaskaskia Records. From the facts known about Dodge, little credit can be given to his testimony, yet the present paper, so far as it charges Hamilton with acts of cruelty performed at Detrºit... largely based on his statements. Dodge wrote to a friend in July, 1779:." am going to Williamsburg in a few days to prosecute Hamiltºn and that Rascal Dejean Lamotte, likewise Hominay Hay. They will all be hanged without redemption, and the Lord have mercy on their Souls." Later in September he wrote that he had had the pleasure of seeing these same men in irons in a dungeon and he adds, “they were put there for the usage, they gave me at Detroit.” Alvord, Kaskaskia Records (I. H. C., v.), 104. 122.

INDICTMENT OF HAMILTON, JUNE 16, 1779 339 their return and successes by a discharge of cannon; that when a prisoner brought alive, and destined to death by the Indians, the fire already kindled, and himself bound to the stake, was dextor- ously withdrawn and secreted from them by the humanity of a fellow prisoner; a large reward was offered for the discovery of the victim, which having tempted a servant to betray his con- cealment, the present prisoner Dejean being sent with a party of soldiers, surrounded the house, took and threw into jail the unhappy victim, and his deliverer, where the former soon expired under the perpetual assurances of Dejean, that he was again to be restored into the hands of the savages, and the latter when en- larged was bitterly and illiberally reprimanded and threatened by Governour Hamilton. It appears to them that the prisoner Dejean, was on all occasions the willing and cordial instrument of Governour Hamilton, acting both as judge and keeper of the jail, and instigating and urging him by malicious insinuations and untruths, to increase rather than relax his severities, heightening the cruelty of his orders by the manner of executing them; offering at one time a reward to One prisoner to be the hangman of another, threatening his life On refusal, and taking from his prisoners the little property their Opportunities enabled them to acquire. It appears that the prisoner Lamothe, was a Captain of the volunteer scalping parties of Indians and whites, who went out, from time to time, under general orders, to spare neither men, Women, nor children. From this detail of circumstances which arose in a few cases only, coming accidentally to the knowledge of the Board, they think themselves authorized to presume by fair deduction what would be the horrid history of the sufferings of the many who have expired under their miseries (which therefore will remain for ever untold) or who have escaped from them, are yet too remote and too much dispersed to bring together their well grounded accusations against these prisoners. They have seen that the conduct of the British officers, civil and military, has in its general tenor, through the whole course of this War, been savage and unprecedented among civilized nations; that our officers and soldiers taken by them have been loaded with
Page 340
340 ILLINOIS HISTORICAL COLLECTIONS irons, consigned to loathsome and crouded jails, dungeons, and prison ships; supplied often with no food, generally with too little for the sustenance of nature, and that little sometimes unsound and unwholesome, whereby so many of them have perished that captivity and miserable death have with them been almost synoni. mous; that they have been transported beyond seas where their fate is out of the reach of our enquiry, have been compelled to take arms against their country, and by a new refinement in cruelty to become the murtherers of their own brethren. Their prisoners with us have, on the other hand, been treated with moderation and humanity; they have been fed on all occa- sions with wholesome and plentiful food, lodged comfortably, suffered to go at large within extensive tracts of country, treated with liberal hospitality, permitted to live in the families of our citizens, to labour for themselves, to acquire and to enjoy property, and finally to participate of the principal benefits of society while privileged from all its burthens. Reviewing this contrast which cannot be denied by our enemies themselves in a single point, which has now been kept up during four years of unremitted war, a term long enough to produce well founded despair that our moderation may ever lead them into the practice of humanity, called on by that justice which we owe to those who are fighting the battles of their country, to deal out at length miseries to their enemies, measure for measure, and to distress the feelings of mankind by exhibiting to them spectacles of severe retaliation, where we had long and vainly endeavoured to introduce an emulation in kindness; happily possessed by the fortune of war of some of those very individuals, who having distinguished themselves personally in this line of cruel conduct, are fit subjects to begin on with the work of retaliation, this Board has resolved to advise the Governour that the said Henry Hamil- ton, Philip Dejean, and William Lamothe, prisoners of war, be put into irons, confined in the dungeon of the public jail, debarred the use of pen, ink, and paper, and excluded all converse except with their keeper. And the Governour orders accordingly. (A Copy) Attest ARCHIBALD BLAIR, C. C. Williamsburg: Printed by John Dixon and Thomas Nicolson.

G. R. CLARK. THOMAS JEFFERSON to GoverNOR GUY CARLETON, July 22, 1779. [Clark MSS., Va. State Archives.—A. L. S.] SIR, Your Letter, on the Subject of Lieutenant Governor Hamil- tons confinement, came safely to hand. I shall with great chear- ſuſness explain to you, the Reasons on which the advice of Council was founded, since, after the satisfaction of doing what is right, the greatest is that of having what we do approved by those opinion deserve esteem. We think ourselves justified in Governor Hamilton strict confinement, on the general principle of national retaliation. To state to you the particular facts of British Cruelty to american prisoners, would be to give a melancholy history from the capture of Col” Ethan Allen, at the beginning of the war, to the present day; a history which I will avoid, as equally disagreeable, to you, & to me. I with pleasure do you the justice to say that I believe .* Published in Thomas Jefferson, Writings (Ford ed.), 11., 248 ct seq. and in Cal. of Va. State Papers, i., 321.

What has bºſ done in England, & what in New York, and Philadelphia, you at probably uninformed; as it would hardly be made the subject'ſ epistolary correspondence. I will only observe to you, Sir, thā. the confinement, and treatment, of our officers, soldiers, & Seamºſ, have been so rigorous, and cruel, as that a very great proportion of the whole of those captured in the course of this war, & carrie! to Philadelphia, while in possession of the British army, and to New York, have perished miserably, from that cause only, and tº the fact is as well established, with us, as any historical fact which has happened in the course of the War. A Gentleman of this Commonwealth, in public office, and of known & established Character, who was taken on sea, carried to New York, and tº changed, has given us lately a particular information of the treak ment of our prisoners there. Officers taken by Land, it seems, are permitted to go on parole within certain limits on Long Island till suggestions shall be made to their prejudice by some Toº refugee or other equally worthless person, when they are hurried to the Prevot in New York, without enquiring whether they be founded upon positive facts, be matter of hearsay, or taken ſº the reports of interested men. The example of enquiring into the truth of charges of this nature, according to legal principles of evidence has surely not been set us by our Enemics. We enqº, what these Prevots were and were told they were the commº" miserable jails, built for the confinement of Malefactors. officer and men taken by sea are kept in prison ships, in [MS ‘’” from five to ten a day.

JEFFERSON TO CARLETON, JULY 22, 1779 349 instance which has occurred in my own country, and if there has been another in any of the United States, it is unknown to me, these instances must have been extremely rare; if they have ever existed at all, or they could not have been altogether unheard of by me, when a uniform exercise of kindness to prisoners on our part has been returned by us as uniform severity on the part of Our enemies, you must excuse me for saying it is high time, by other lessons, to teach respect to the dictates of humanity in such a case, retaliation becomes an act of benevolence. But suppose, Sir, we were willing, still longer, to decline the drudgery of general retaliation; yet Governor Hamilton's conduct has been such as to call for exemplary punishment on him person- ally. In saying this I have not so much in view his particular cruelties to our to our Citizens, prisoners with him, (which, tho they have been great, were of necessity confined to a small scale) as the general nature of the service he undertook, at Detroit, and the extensive exercise of cruelties which that involved. Those who act together in war are answerable for each other. No distinction can be made between principal and ally by those agnst whom the War is waged. He who employs another to do a deed, makes the Deed his own. If he calls in the hand of the assassin, or murderer, himself becomes the assassin or murderer. The known rule of warfare with the Indian Savages is an indiscriminate butchery of men Women & children. These Savages, under this well- known Character, are employed by the British nation as allies in the war against the Americans. Governor Hamilton undertakes to be the conductor of the war. In the execution of that under- taking, he associates small parties of the whites under his imme- diate command with large parties of the Savages, & sends them to act, Sometimes jointly, sometimes separately, not agst our forts, or armies in the field but the farming settlements on our frontiers. Governor Hamilton then is himself the butcher of men women & children. I will not say to what length the fair rules of war would extend the right of punishment against him; but I am sure that confinement, under its strictest circumstances, as a retaliation for Indian devastation & massacre, must be deemed Lenity. I appre- hend you had not sufficiently adverted to the expression in the advice of the Council, when you suppose the proclamation there

350 ILLINOIS HISTORICAL COLLECTIONS D alluded to, to be the one addressed to the Inhabitants of the Illi- nois afterwards printed in the public papers, & to be affirmed [MS. torn] Proclamation, there alluded to, contained nothing more than an invitation to our officers and Soldiers to join the British Arms against those whom he is pleased to call Rebels and Traitors—In order to introduce these among our people, they were put into the hands of the Indians; and in every house, where they murdered or carried away the family, they left one of these proclamations. Some of them were found sticking on the breasts of the persons murdered, one under the hand and Seal of Governor Hamilton came to our hands. The Indians being the Bearers of proclamations, under the hand and Seal of Governor Hamilton (no matter what was the Subject of them) there can be no doubt they were acting under his direction; and, as, including this proof, the fact was cited in the advice of the Council. But if you will be so good as to recur to the address of the Illinois, which you refer to, you will find that, tho' it does not in express terms threaten vengeance, blood & Massacre, yet it proves that the Governor had made for us the most ample provision of all these Calamities. He there gives in detail the horrid Catalogue of savage nations, extending from South to North, whom he had leag'd with himself to wage combined war on our frontiers: and it is well known that that war would of course be made up of blood, and general Massacres of mem Women & Children. Other papers of Governor Hamiltons have come to our hands, containing instructions to officers going out with Scalping parties of Indians and Whites, & proving that that kind of war was waged under his express orders further proofs in abundance might be adduced, but I suppose [MS. torn the fact too notorious to need them. Your letter seems to admit an inference that, whatever may have been the general conduct of our Enemies towards the prison- ers, or whatever the personal conduct of Governor Hamilton, yet. as a prisoner by capitulation, you consider him as privileged from strict confinement. I do not pretend to an intimate knowledge of this Subject. my Idea is that the term ‘prisoners of war' is a generic one, the specification of which is 1* Prisoners at discre- tion: & 2" prisoners on convention, or Capitulation. Thus, in the - *-

The treatment of the first class ought to be such as is approved by the usage of polished nations; gentle & humane, unless a contrary conduct in an Enemy, Or individual, renders a stricter treatment necessary. The prisoners of the 2" Class have nothing to exempt them from a like treatment with those of the 1* except so far as they shall have been able to make better terms by Articles of Capitulation So far then as these shall have provided for an exemption from strict treatment to prisoners on [capitulation have] a right to be distinguished [MS. torn] certain causes antecedent thereto, tho' such instances might be produced, from English history too, and in one case where the King himself commanded in person. Marshal Boufflers after the taking of the Castle of Namur, was arrested and detained prisoner of War by King William tho by an article in the Capitulation it was stipulated that the Officers * Soldiers of the Garrison in general, and Marshal Boufflers by name, shold be at liberty. However we waive reasoning on this head, because no article in the Capitulation of Governor Hamil- ºn is violated by his confinement. perhaps not having seen the Capitulation, you were led to suppose it a thing of course, that, being able to obtain terms of surrender, they would first provide *their own treatment. I inclose you a Copy of the Capitulation, by which you will see that the 2d article declares them prisoners * War, and nothing is said as to the treatment they were to be titled to. When Governor Hamilton signs indeed, he adds a flourish, containing the motives inducing him to capitulate, one **ich was confidence in a generous Enemy. He should have ºflected that generosity on a large scale would take side against However these were only his private motives, & did not º *to the contract of Colº Clarke. Being prisoners of War viº * only such privileges as their Capitulation has pro- seat. that having provided nothing on the Subject of their *nt, they are liable to be treated as other prisoners. We
Page 352
352 ILLINOIS HISTORICAL COLLECTIONS have not extended our order, as we might justifiably have done, to the whole of this Corps. Governor Hamilton, & Capt" La- mothe alone, as leading officers, are in confinement. The other officers & men are treated as if they had been taken in justifiable War; the officers being at large on their parole, and the men also having their liberty to a certain extent. (Dejean was not in- cluded in the Capitulation being taken 8 Days after, on the Wabache 150 Miles from St Vincennes) I hope Sir, that, being made more fully acquainted with the facts on which the advice of Council was grounded, and exercising your own good sense in cool & candid deliberation on these facts, & the consequences deducible from them, according to the usage & Sentiments of civilized nations, you will see the transaction in a very different light from that in which it appeared at the time of writing your Letter, and ascribe the advice of the Council, not to want of attention to the sacred nature of public Conventions, of which I hope we shall never, in any circumstances, lose sight but to a desire of stopping the effusion of ye unoffending blood of women & Children, and the unjustifiable severities exercised on our captive officers & soldiers in general, by proper severities on our part.

Slaughter dated early in July, I gave YourExcellency a full account of the situations of this Country, since which nothing important has happened here. Col. Clark I suppose is by this time at the Falls of Ohio and as the expedition against Detroit is declined he will probably wait upon you in Person. Col. Rogers has arrived from Orleans and will be the Bearer hereof or send it by the Earliest opportunity. I am uneasy in knowing that the accounts he will render concerning the quantity as well as the bad condition of the goods cannot be satisfactory—Who is to blame in it? The Batteau Masters who brought it up—the person in whose care it was left at St. Louis—or the Conductor of our Stores or all of them. I cannot determine—The taking and disposing of them was (perhaps necessarily) planned, and in part executed, before my arrival. The Conductors powers and Instructions were in no part derived from me, now was he answerable to me for any malfeazance in office—Col. Clark will, I doubt not, satisfy you in this matter. I wish the opportunity by Col. Rogers were safer. I have 15 or 20 thousand Dollars to send down on public account. I have required that all the money of the called-in emissions be sealed up, & stopped from Circulating of which I expect we have in the Country 20 to 30 thousand Dollars more. I have recommended that the People wait some future opportunity more safe for sending it down. The Resolns of Congress bears hard upon Illinois where the risque is so great. If Congress have not yet made provision for the Redpton of the Money, I hope your Excellency will apply to Congress—I shall be cautious that none of the called-in emis- sions be brought into the Country or [not legible] which may come * This has been published in Mich.

The uniting the different Districts of my charge has so engaged me that I have not had time to prepare Answers to the Queries delivered me by some gentle" of your Honb. Board. As to Indian grants it may be necessary immediately to inform you, that they are almost numberless, only four of them are very considerable, the smallest of which will be near a 1,000,000 acres, and the whole between 7 & 8 millions of Acres. The grantees all reside in Philadelphia, London, Pennsylvania, & Virginia and are between 40 & 50, Merchants chiefly. How far it may be proper to make such contracts binding upon the Indians I cannot say. I submit it to your Excellency, whether it is not necessary to prevent Indian grants by other methods than making void the purchase; I mean by fines, and at the same time to prevent underfines, &c. the making of any settlements within the charter Bounds of the State, except under certain Permission & Reservations. This I apprehend to be necessary immediately as some Land jobbers from the South side of Ohio have been making improvements (as they call them) upon the unpurchased Land on this side of the River, and are beyond the reach of punishment from me—with the arrival of new adventurers this Summer the same spirit of Land jobbing begins to breathe here. - I expected to have been prepared to present to your excellency Some amendments upon the Form of government for Illinois, but the present will be attended with no great inconveniences till the Spring Session, when I beg your Permission to attend and get a Discharge from an Office, which an unwholesome air, & Distance from my Connexions, & Language not familiar to me, and an Impossibility of procuring many of the conveniences of life suitable: all tend to render uncomfortable. As to military affairs Col. Clark will offer your Excellency Observations on that Head, which I wish to defer being more his province. - Perhaps an additional Agent for supplying the Indians with foods may be neccssary.

If an expedition should be ordered against the Natchez, There cannot be any great dependence placed on the Illinois furnishing more than 100,000 lbs of Flour, & supporting the Troops now here and Scarcely any Beef.

If those troops are to draw their subsistence from the Illinois, what would it require annually? “4th. If by tobacco lodged in French or Spanish posts, what quantity would be sufficient? “5th.

376 ILLINOIS HISTORICAL COLLECTIONS “In answer to the 1st proposition, ‘what number of troops would enable us to reduce Detroit or the Floridians on the Mis- sissippi?" the council, considering the present state of Detroit and the well-affected dispositions of the adjacent inhabitants, do conceive that that post might be reduced by a few well- disciplined troops, but as these troops have a long, tedious and fatiguing march all the way through a hostile country, exposed to frequent interruptions and attacks from the savages, our nat- ural enemy, as well as many unforeseen accidents, consequently attendant on long marches, they are unanimously of opinion that not less than one thousand troops would be requisite for effecting that purpose—which number they conceive would be amply suffi- cient, as well as for holding the same. . . . . The reductions of the Floridians on the Mississippi the council conceived to be by no means either of so difficult or dangerous a nature as that of Detroit. When they consider that there are few or no savages to encounter with, the descent speedy and rapid, without fatiguing the troops, the inhabitants being finally well affected towards us, the great probability of the enemy being much weakened for want of the necessary supplies and re-enforcements. Add to all, the certainty of war being declared between Spain and Great Britain, and of the enemy being blocked up or narrowly watched at Mobile and Pensacola, from whence all the supplies and re-enforcements, if on the Mississippi, must come. These considerations induce them to be unanimously of opinion that the Floridians would become a safe and easily conquest with five hundred troops, well disciplined, who would also be sufficient to protect a country, etc. “In answer to the second proposition, ‘how are those troops to be supported in provisions?' the council are of opinion that supplies of bread kind can be furnished from the Illinois country; but as to the meat species, it must come from some part of the Ohio or waters east thereof. “The council are unable to ascertain the sum it would require annually in case the troops should draw their subsistence from the Illinois as mentioned in the third proposition, because they do not think the Illinois can furnish a sufficiency of the meat species, besides the price of provisions, as well as all other necessaries in that country, is so variable, fluctuating and uncertain.
Page 377
COUNCIL OF WAR, NOVEMBER 16, 1779 377 "The fourth proposition, “if by tobacco lodged in French or Spanish ports, what quantity would be sufficient?’ has been answered by the foregoing, as the council know of no standard price for either tobacco or provisions to make just calculations. "To the fifth proposition, ‘what fortifications for the Illinois and where, their strength, etc.?' the council (say) that 'tis their Opinion three fortifications are sufficient, viz.: one at Kahokia, One at Post St. Vincent, one at Auabache, and one at or near the mouth of the Ohio, in the most convenient place on the banks of the Mississippi, each fortification to be one hundred feet square in the clear within the walls, to be built of earth dug out of an entrenchment ten feet deep, with earth thrown upon the inside of said entrenchment, must form a wall of ten feet high and eight feet thick, which with the entrenchment, which will form a wall of twenty feet perpendicular, on the top of which they conceive it necessary there should be a wooden wall of sawed or hewn timber ten feet high, twelve inches thick, with bastions at each corner so proportioned that one shall clear another. The garrison at Ka- hokia to consist of one hundred and fifty troops, and the garrison at Post St. Vincent of one hundred and fifty troops, and the garrison at or near the mouth of Ohio, two hundred troops. "The sixth proposition inquires, ‘what provisions might be turnished by the inhabitants of the Illinois?’ to which the council *"swer as their unanimous opinion that the Illinois inhabitants might supply five hundred troops in provisions of the bread kind *rly, but as to the meat species they can not conceive that any dependence can be placed on them for that article.” John BALEY Cap' RP HARRISON Cap' EDw” WoRTHINGTON Cap' THo° QUIRK Cap' ROBT.

I hope to see our paper money rise in its value quickley, for Congress have lately effected a loan of two million of dollars (and may have eight more) in Urope, wheh with the asstanse [assistance] of the Taxes which have been increased by the last assembly, I think cannot fail restoring its value in a great degree. I expect that Goverment are cutting out more business for you by what I learnt from the Governor, oh! that peace would wonce more vissit our Country & “let every one sit under his Wine and under his Fig Tree and no one to make him afraid;" happy would it be for this part of the State but more so for that where you are, the Interest of which I assure you I have much at heart- and only want oppertunity to manifest my attachment thereto, and when I was with you I thought my acquaintance M' Randolph was likewise attached to the Interest of the Kentuckey settlements but I am sorry to inform you that I have reason to believe the contrary for on looking over the books in the Land office I found a Certain Mr Bealls had taken out warrants to the amount of 140,000 Acres of Land at least, part of which was enterdassigned to M' N. Randolph now is this consonant with the doctrine he held when I was with you, and is it consistant with the Interest of that Country to assist a man (and a speculator too) in locating such a body of Land (& I suppose to of the Richest sort) when he will never see the Country or if he did, the portion is to large—no man can hesitate a moment to pronounce that it is not the Interest of the back Country. The evil tendancy will so fully appear to you that I will quit the subject & say nothing more about it. I shall move out some of my people with my stocks next fall & the summer after I shall bring my family with eight or ten more families to settle at or near the falls, and I could wish it was in my power to come out sooner, tho am preparing as fast as I can.

[Draper MSS., 46.J57.—L.

We wish you therefore to treat with them for as much as will do for this purpose and for a few settlements round it for the support of y" post. indeed if they should show a disposition to part with it you may treat for all their lands between the Mississippi, Ohio, Tanissee & Carolina boundary the whole being of but small extent. I think not exceeding 20 miles square if reduced to that form. If they do not discover a willingness to part with the whole, get ground for a fort & as 1much as you can round about it to make corn, furnish wood &c Obtain them on as good terms as possible to be paid for in goods, which we will have provided for them the whole when sold at our Land Office price will not bring in more than three thousand pounds Sterling.

Your letters of October 26th & 28th and Novºr 6th came safely to hand & lastly that of August 24th. I am glad the proposition of establishing a post at or near the Mouth of Ohio is likely to answer as well in practice as to us to us who judged on theory only, it seemed likely to do. I have therefore written to Messrs Walker & Smith as you will see by the enclosed copy of my letter to them, to take observations of the Latitudes thereabouts that we may proceed on the surest grounds. You will please to furnish assistants, Guards, & all necessaries. I expect the description of the cliffs &c will be so minute as that when you see them you will know them in the plat & of course know their Latitude, the choice of the ground for your Fort must be left to yourself. It should be as near the Mouth of Ohio as can be found fit for fortification & within our own lines. Some attention would be proper also to the circumjacent grounds as it will probably become a town of importance. The nature of the defensive works & their extent you will accomodate to your Force. I would recommend your attention to the wood of which you make your stockades, that it be of the most lasting kind. from the best information I have * Printed also in Alvord, Kaskaskia Records (I. H.

JEFFERSON TO CLARK, JANUARY 29, 1780 387 had I take for granted that our line will pass below the Mouth of Ohio. Our purchases of the Cherokees hitherto have not ex- tended Southward or westward of the Tennessee. Of course the little Tract of country between the Mississippi Ohio Tennessee & Carolina line (in which your Fort will be) is still to be purchased from them before you can begin your works. To effect this I have written to Maj. Martin our Cherokee Agent of which letter I en- close you a copy If the new Fort should fall within this teritory & it can be purchased we may grant lands to Settlers who will fix round about the fort provided the Assembly should approve of it, as from its reasonableness I think they will. The manner in which the Lots of Land are laid off about the French Villages I have thought very wise & worthy of imitation perhaps besides guarding your promises of Lands to Settlers with the conditions above men- tioned it would be well to add also the mode of laying them off. I send you recruiting instructions for having your Battalion filled up with men to be enlisted for the War as I wish to avoid receiving any on any other terms Your instructions for recruiting which were communicated to us by some of your officers in the fall we took in and gave them such as are now sent you, instead of County money I send you three Hundred Land Warrants, for Five Hun- dred & Sixty acres of Land each which at Forty pounds the Hundred being the Treasury price amounts to the Bounty allowed by Law. these we think more likely to induce men to enlist than the money itself. I also send you twenty four blank Commissions which will be necessary to Officer eight companies the present plan of the Continental army having that number in a Battalion and a Captain Lieutenant & Ensign only to each company. The officers of your Battalion when commissioned will stand on a footing with the Officers of the other State Batt" The State of the Public Finances obliged the late Assembly to reduce very much their Military Establishment from what they had proposed at their session in May. they discontinued raising both the additional Eastern Batt" & one of the Western. So there will be one Battalion only to send to you to which is to be annexed Major Slaughters Hundred men who have already marched as I expect for the falls of the Ohio. I wish that one Battalion may be --

3.SS ILLINOIS HISTORICAL COLLECTIONS raised in time to join you in the Spring, very few returns having been made to me I cannot say what number is raised probably not more than half. However, whatsoever number may be raised by that time shall march as soon as the season will admit. By them we will send such stores as to us occur to be necessary, such as Powder, Lead, Flints, Hoes, Axes, Saws, Gimblets, Nails, Hammers, Augurs, drawing Knives, Froes & camp Kettles. It there be any other articles necessary I must get you to write to me on the Subject also to settle the best route of sending those articles hereafter there being no Guards to be had but Militia for conveying them from the Frontiers & no dependence on co- lecting Militia. Cannot you point out to us some place on the Frontiers where they may be safely lodged from time to time & from whence you can send for them with a proper escort? I would wish you also to inform me to what post I shall order the Battalion which is to join you. We received letters from Mr Pollock in the fall informing us of our debts at New Orleans & his distresses. We had just taken measures by shipping Tobacco to France to procure necessaries for our army having no other means of releiving Mº Pollock we were obliged to give him draughts on France which took the whole of that Fund & has distressed us exceedingly. The demands of Col Legras & Capt Lintot coming on us now & it being impossible to raise hard money to discharge them we are utterly at a loss what to do with them, indeed we shall not be able to determine them absolutely as to the sum we shall pay them till we know from you what propº tion of the Dollars for which they have draughts were expended at the depreciated prices or in other words til we know from you what sum in hard money would reimburse their advances for which your draughts on us were made which we should be glad you would inform us by the first opportunity and send a duplicate by some sccond conveyance the difficulty of answering demandº of hard money renders it necessary for us to contract no debts where our paper is not current it throws on us the tedious & perplexing operations of investing paper money in Tobacco, finding transportation for the Tobacco to France repeating this as often as the dangers of capture renders it necessary to insure

JEFFERSON TO CLARK, JANUARY 29, 1780 380 the safe arrival of some part & negotiating Bills besides the ex- pensive Train of Agents to do all this & the delay it occasions to the creditor. We must therefore recommend to you to purchase nothing beyond the Ohio which you can do without or which may be obtained from the East side where our paper is current. I am exceedingly glad you are making such timely provision of your next years subsistence. A Commissary for the Western Deptmt: was appointed in the fall with orders to purchase provisions on the Frontier for one Battalion his instructions shall be enlarged & a notification sent him to comply with your requisitions besides this we leave to yourself to Commission Mº Shannon to act as Commisary of purchases Issues Stores, Quarter Master or what- ever else you may find him useful in. I suppose you will cmploy him principally about the Posts while the one acting in the Fron- tiers will be providing thereabouts. We shall use all our endeav- ours to furnish your men with necessary clothing but long experience renders it proper to warn you that our Supplies will be precarious You cannot therefore be too attentive to the provid- ing them in your own Quarter as far as Skins will enable you to do it in short I must confide in you to take such care of the men under you as an economical householder would of his own family doing everything within himself as far as he can & calling for as few supplies as possible, the less you depend for supplics from this Quarter the less will you be disappointed by those impediments distance & a precarious foreign Commerce throw in the way for these reasons it will be eligible to withdraw as many of your men as you can from the West side of the Ohio leaving only so many as may be necessary for keeping the Illinois Settlements in Spirits & for their real defence. We must faithfully attend to their protection but we must accomodate our measures for doing this to our means perhaps this idea may render doubtful the ex- pediency of employing your men in building a fort at Kaskaskia such Fort might perhaps be necessary for the Settlers to withdraw into in time of danger but might it not also render a surprise the more dangerous by giving the enemy a means of holding a Settle- ment which otherwise they could only distress by a sudden visit & be obliged to abandon Of this you must be ultimately the judge We approve very much of a mild conduct towards the

Amuni- tion should be furnished gratis to those Warriors who go actually on expeditions against the Hostile Tribes As to the English notwithstanding their base example we wish not to expose them to the inhumanities of a savage enemy. Let this reproach remain on them, but for ourselves we would not have our national charac- ter tarnished with such a practice. If indeed they strike the Indians these will have a natural right to punish the aggreSSOrs and we none to hinder them it will then be no act of ours but to invite them to a participation of the [war] is what we would avoid by all possible means If the English would admit them to trade & by that means get those wants supplied which we cannot supply I should think it right provided they require from them no terms of departing from their neutrality, if they will not permit this I think the Indians might be urged to break off all corre- spondence with them to forbid their emissaries from coming among them & to send them to you if they disregarded the pro- hibitions, it would be well to communicate honestly to them our present want of those articles necessary for them & our inability to get them to encourage them to struggle with the difficulties as we do til peace when they may be confidently assured we will spare nothing to put their Trade on a comfortable and just footing in the mean time we must endeavour to furnish them with amuni- tion to provide Skins to clothe themselves, with a disposition to do

In a letter to you of the 1st inst: I supposed you would in the ensuing Summer engage either in the Shawanee war or against Detroit leaving the choice of these & all other objects to yourself I must also refer to you whether it will be best to build the Fort at the Mouth of Ohio before you begin your campaign or after you shall have ended it, perhaps indecd the delays of obtaining leave from the Cherokees or of making a purchase from they may oblige you to postpone it till the fall I have recº letters from Captains Shelby & Wortherington the former acquainting me he had recº your instructions to raise a Troop of Horse the latter that he had raised one from the date of your letter to Shelby I knew you could not have been apprised that the Assembly had authorised us to raise a Troop for you & that we had given a commission to Rogers by whom you sent us information of the capture of St. Vincennes, Rogers accordingly raised his men got all accoutrements & marched to join you in the fall. As to Capt Wotherington who sais he has raised hisn men you must state to us the necessity for your raising two Troops, that we may lay it before the Assembly who alone have a power of giving sanction to the measure the distress of the Public Treasury will be a great obstacle so that it will be well for you to take measures for reserving to yourself the benefit of Capt Wotherington's men in some other capacity if they should be disapproved of as Horsemen I am Sir Your very humble Servº (Signed) TH JEFFERSON [Endorsed:] Letter of Instructions from Thos Jefferson to Genl George Rogers Clark (1780) copy Wm P C

L.] W*BURG Jany 29th 1780 SIR- As we propose this spring to take possession of and fortify some post as near the mouth of Ohio as the ground will admit, it becomes very important for us to know the exact latitude thereabouts. I take it for granted that your present Line will be stopped before you get there by unpurchased Lands. We there. fore wish extremely that one of you would take a trip to the mouth of the Ohio with your instruments immediately upon finishing your present work. I Suppose it will be best for you to go to the falls of the Ohio where Col” Clarke has orders to furnish you with Assistants, an escort and all necessaries. You will first find the point at which our Line strikes the Missisippi or Ohio, and fix it by some lasting immovable natural mark if there happen to be any on the spot, or if not, then by its course or distance from Some such natural mark, noting such course as corrected from the errors of variation, and the distance reduced to horizontal measure. the reason of requiring this accuracy in fixing the point where Our . Line strikes is, that in future, with common instruments it will be easy to find it which may perhaps be of importance. When you have found this point if it be on the Missisippi run from thence along up the river to the mouth of Ohio, and by protraction fix the point of the forks, or if it be on the Ohio, run up that river to where good Clifts for fortification shall make in and as you go along note the high grounds points or Clifts on the river which appear to you capable of Works of defence and at the same time to command a view of the river. This done I would ask the favor of you to return one plat of your work to Colº Clarke and another to me. Col” Clarke has in his eye a particular Cliff on the Mississippi which he expects is the nearest good ground for fortification. This he will describe to you, and you will please to note it particularly. I am in hopes that it will suit one of you to undertake this business. We think to have the fort begun, which cannot be till we are assured that the ground we should pitch

They on Wednesday Last killied and scalped Col" Calaway and Lº Pemberment Rollins, and Either killed or took two negro's.

In short, Sir, we think that there will be no Living in this Country without Carrying on an Expedition immediately against them; and to that

GESS TO CLARK, MARCH 10, 1780 397 End have unanimously come to a Resolution of falling on some method for that Purpose—we think that nothing will so well answer the purpose as to Obtain the Concurrance of Col” George Rogers Clark. If he can be prevailed on to take the command, and Assist us with his guns there is no Doubt of Success, and if he shou'd be otherwise engaged or Can't be prevailed on to go in person, We think of Col" Linn as the next in place who wou'd answer the purpose. Upon the Whole, Sir, we think the necessity so great that no time ought to be Lost. Therefore have Come to a Resolution among ourselves to furnish as many fighting men from this place as posible and in order to Effect it have agreed to give Every able Bodied man who will turn out on this occasion fifteen Bushels of Corn which we think sufficient To broad them the Next scason. This bounty with the prospect of plunder and their anxious Desire of Revenging past injuries and preventing future will we Dont Doubt Cause as many of our young men to turn out as can be spared or by any means ought to go. We further propose in this necessary Enterprize that Every man shou'd find his own provision and be under the Command of Col" George Rogers Clarke or some other gentleman to be Choosen by them- selves Bound by the solemnity of an oath to observe the Com- mands of their superior officers and submit to any punishment which may be inflicted by a Court Martial in case of Disobedience. This, Sir, is our plann which we hope you will Divulge to the inhabitants] of your Station and the other Neighboring Stations Round you Whose concurrence we hope, at least we expect, They will join in an Expedition: And as to the smaller matters Relating to the Business we surely Cant Diſſer We beg you will Lose no time in communicating this matter on our part nothing shall be wanting with Respect to the settlements on this Side the River as Low as Harrods b'gh and have no Doubt as to Raising the mon. A Boat of Colº Henderson's is setting off To morrow or next Day for the falls by which we sha'] send an address to Col” Clarke To superintend this matter and Obtain his answer as soon as possible Mr Henderson's Boat will be at Lees town on Tucsółay next and will be Convenient for you to send by ; and it will be needful that Col" Clarke should Receive something Like an address from every principal Station.

We are sure that we cannot Live in any tolerable degree of satisfaction, unless we Endeavour to carry on an Expedition against them. our Countrymen of every Station will give all the Assistance in their power, we believe; and we shall not be Back- ward to assist in so necessary an Enterprise. The more to facili- tate the undertaking, we find ourselves Constrained to present this our address to you, Reposing special Trust in your patriotism, Courage and good Conduct. Beg you will head our men, and assist us with your great guns, with which we think we shall be able (under God) to Expel them from our Country. We need not Exagerate on the Cruelty and Devastation with which their foot steps are marked, as you are perfectly acquainted with their savage nature, and Every day almost produces to us fresh instances of their Rapine, and our unhappy Countrymen by them slain, are Irrefrageable proofs of their malicious intentions. Therefore we Entreat you by all the ties of humanity to give us a helping hand, To take the Command of our men and your great guns, and march to the Towns of the Enemy, and Destroy them from the face of the Earth, if possible.

I trust they have no grievance but what we all feel in common, as being forced on us by those to Whom they would now join themselves. had any such grievances existed complaint & refusal of redress should have preceded vio- lence, the measures they are now taking expose them to the pains of the law, to which it is our business to deliver them. we must therefore avoid any irregularity which might give them legal means of withdrawing themselves from punishment. I approve much of your most active endeavours to apprehend the guilty & put them into a course of trial. the carrying them out of the county before an examining court is had on them, if their safe custody requires it must be yeilded to; but if they can be kept safely Without it, I should rather approve it. I suppose this may be done by strong guards of militia, which must be summoned, & subsisted & paid at the public expence. you seem to expect that Writings may be found about them which will convict them of treason. should your evidence however not be such as the law *quires in cases of treason where the punishment is capital, per- haps it may be sufficient to convict them of a misprison of treason which is punishable by fine & imprisonment at the pleasure of the ºurt. I suggest this to you that you may not suppose them abso- ºtely cleared if the evidence will not support the charge of treason.

S.] RichMoxo April 19, 1780 SIR, Your Letter from Louisville of February 22’d—80 came safely to Hand. In answer to your Observations on the Spot proper to take Post on at the Mouth of Ohio we can only give our cordial Sentiments leaving the ultimate Determination to your Prudence on view of the Ground, as we can neither make the particular spot we would elect to be what we should wish nor recommend to you to take Post on it if Nature has rendered it unfit. The Point of Land at the Mouth of the Ohio on the south side is the precise spot which would have been preferred had nature formed it capable of Fortification but this we were apprised was subject to inundation. How deep the Waters, may occasionally be there, we are quite uninformed and therefore are unable to decide on your Proposition for banking them out as at New Orleans. In general, undertakings of that nature are expensive, and not without great Danger that Floods of unexpected Magnitude may overwhelm the Works and Garrison, or that an enterprising Enemy may find Mcans to let in the water. Yet if those Lands lie so high as to be very little under Water, those objections become small in proportion, and may perhaps be less than that of taking the Post
Page 415
JEFFERSON TO CLARK, APRIL 10, 1780 415 at a situation less favorable for vigilance over the Trade of the two rivers. Of this you will judge when you see the Lands and know the height of Inundation they are subject to. If this Place should be rejected, and we were to decide between two Posts one of which should be on the Ohio, the other on the Mississipi below the Mouth of Ohio equally near the Mouth, and equally proper in every other respect, we should prefer the one on the Missisipi because it would command a greater Part of the Trade than the other; for I take for granted more trade will go down the two Rivers to Orleans than down one river to the Mouth and up the other. If the question is between two Situations on the north and South side of the Ohio, equal in other respects, the one on the South side would be greatly preferred. Indeed this circumstance would weigh against a good Degree of other superiority for Reasons which cannot be trusted to a Letter: Yet it would not so far weigh as to prefer a Post which cannot be made tenable to one which can. You describe a high Ground on the north side of the Ohio three or four miles above its mouth, yet the Missisipi, so near in that Part as that a Town might reach from the one to the other and a small river mouthing at the same place and forming a commodious Har- bor for Vessels. This indeed is tempting, as in such a case the navigation of both rivers would be under your Eye as effectually as at the Mouth of Ohio, and holds out such advantages as may get the better of the objections to its being on the north side. However you must finally decide on view of the whole. As to the kind of Fortification I imagine you proposed in the first Place to build a Stockade for temporary Purpose. The Post is so impor- tant really as to merit Works of the best kind, but on this it would necessary to consult the Legislature who would be to provide for the Expence. In the mean Time I imagine you will think it well first to plan & lay off the good works you would propose, and then build your temporary Fort so as to encourage them and protect those who should be working on them, or, if this would be too large to be manned by your Force, the temporary Work might be built within the Lines laid off for the good. When you shall have determined on your spot we should be glad to receive a minute

Incertain whether you were near enough at Hand to afford relief, and indeed rather expecting from your last Letter received that you are now at the mouth of the Ohio, satisfied at the same time that any Plan of enterprize determined and minutely directed here would prove abortive from want of Information and unforeseen Difficulties and Events, I have directed the Lieutenants of the Counties of Washington, Montgomery, Botetourt, Rockbridge and Green-Briar to assemble and concert, and immediately with a Portion of their Militia carry an Expedition into the Indian Country. To communicate their determinations to the Lieuten” of the Counties Northward of them between the Blue-ridge and Allegany who are also to assemble, concert, and execute similar offensive Measures with their Militia either by concurring in the same, or undertaking a separate Expedition; and those again to call for aids from the Counties West of the Allegany. They are to give Notice of their Plans to yourself, and should the combination of the Enemy appear still formidable for their Force I have desired them to ask such Assistance as you can give them, and in such way as you shall Think most effectual.

SIR, In a Letter, which I had the Honor of addressing you on the meeting of the present General Assembly, I informed you of the necessities which had led the Executive to withdraw our west- ern troops to the Ohio. since the date of that Letter I have re- ceived the inclosed of the second instant from Colo Todd com- municating the measures he had adopted in Conjunction with colo Clarke to procure such a Settlement contiguous to the post which shall be taken as may not only strengthen the garrison occasionally, but be able to raise provisions for them. as the con- firmation of these measures is beyond the powers of the executive, it is my duty to refer them to the General Assembly, it may be proper to observe that the grant of Lands by colo Todd was made on a supposition that the post woud be taken on the north side of the Ohio whereas I think it more probable it will be on the south side in the Lands lying between the Tanissee Ohio Missisippi and Carolina boundery. These Lands bclong to the Chickasaw indians, who from intelligence which we think may be relied on, have cntered into war with us. The expenditures of the Ilinois, have becn decmed from some expressions in the act establishing that county not subject to the examination of the board of Auditors As the auditing these ac- counts is very foreign to the ordinary office of the Council of State, would employ much of that time and attention which at at present [blank in MS.] called to objects [blank in MS.] general importance and as their powers would not enable them to take into consideration the justice and expediency of indemnifying Colo Todd for his Losses and services as desired in the inclosed 'Printed in Cal. of Va.

I have the honor to be with great respect & esteem Sir Your most obedient & most humble sert TH: JEFFERSON PROPOSED GRANT OF LAND to CLARK, June 30, 1780. [Journal of Virginia House of Delegates, Friday, June 30, 1780.] Mr. Strother reported, from the committee of Propositions and Grievances, that the committee had, according to order, had under their consideration, the petition of Col. George Rogers Clarke, together with an Indian deed to him, for a certain tract of land therein mentioned, to them referred, and had agreed upon a report and come to several resolutions thereupon, which he read in his place, and afterwards delivered in at the clerk's table, where the same were again read, and are as followeth: It appears to this committee, that the said Col. George Rogers Clarke, hath rendered great services to this Commonwealth, no: only in reducing the British posts at the Kaskaskies and St. Vin- cent's, and engaging the inhabitants there to become citizens of this Commonwealth; but also in defeating the machinations of our enemies, by attaching to our interest, many heretofore hostile tribes of Indians, and thereby saving the inhabitants of the western frontiers of this and the neighboring States, from a cruci and destructive Indian war, meditated by the British officers against them. It also appears to this committee, that the said Indian tribes inhabiting the country upon the Obache, and the adjacent waters of the Ohio, as a testimony of their great regard for the said Col. Clarke, and their friendship to Virginia, and the other United States of America, made him a deed of conveyance, bearing date the sixteenth day of June, one thousand seven hundred and seventy nine, for a certain tract of land at the falls on the northwest side of the Ohio river, of seven miles and a half square, containing about thirty six thousand acres, which is registered in the records of the court of St. Vincent's; that, although this Commonwealth hath the undoubted right of pre-emption from the Indians, of a
Page 429
PROPOSED GRANT OF LAND TO CLARK 429 lands within its own territory, and the said deed not being valid in law, Col. Clarke disclaims any title under it unless the same shall be confirmed to him by the legislature. Yet this committee, upon considering the allegations in the said petition, are of opinion, that the said tract of land ought to be granted to the said Col. Clarke, for the consideration money of twenty pounds for every hundred acres, reserving for the public use one thousand acres thereof, in the most convenient part, for a fort and town. Whereupon, your committee came to the following resolutions: RESOLVED, That the said petition is reasonable; and that the register of the land office, ought to be empowered to grant unto the said Col. George Rogers Clarke, upon the auditor's certificate of the payment of the sum of seven thousand pounds current money, into the treasury; a special warrant directed to the sur- veyor of Kentucky county, authorising and requiring him, to lay off and survey, for the said Col. Clarke, the said tract of land, to contain thirty-six thousand acres, according to the following bounds, viz: beginning on the northwest side of the Ohio river, opposite to the middle of the first Island below the falls, and ex- tending thence, up the said river, according to the several courses and meanders thereof, so far as upon reducing the same to a straight line, will measure seven miles and a half; thence into the woods by a course at right angles, with the said reduced lines, so far as by running a line parallel with the said reduced line, seven miles and a half; and from thence to the beginning, will include be- tween the back line and the meanders of the river, the aforesaid quantity of thirty six thousand acres; and upon the return of the plat and certificate, of the said survey, into the land office, and payment of the legal fees, that the Governor be empowered and required to make a grant for the same, unto the said Col. George Rogers Clarke, his heirs and assigns, with a clause or clauses there- in, expressly excepting and reserving, for the public use and bene- fit, the quantity of one thousand acres of land, bounded as follows: beginning on the river side, one hundred and sixty poles below the lower part of the falls, or greatest fall of water; and running thence up the river, according to its several meanders, one hundred and sixty poles above the hammock of drift trees, at the upper end of the said falls; and from thence into the woods by a course at right

RESOLVED, AS THE OPINION OF YOUR COMMITTEE, That the said tract of land ought to be exempted from the pay- ment of taxes, until the adjacent lands on the same side of the Ohio river shall be settled, which is at present prohibited, and taxes imposed on them.

When they left the town they carried off the artillery, powder and balls, thereby depriving us of the only means of defending ourselves against the fury of the savages whom they have excited against us.

434 ILLINOIS HISTORICAL COLLECTIONS THOMAs JEFFERSON to ColoSEL WILLIAM PRESTON, July 3, 1780, [Draper MSS., 5003S.–L. S.] RICHMOND July 3' 1780 SIR The measures you have taken for the preservation of the Lead mines by calling in the militia of Montgomery Washington and Botetourt are as wise as could have been advised, and as effectual as in the present State of things can be administered. The dis- tress of the Western Frontier is much too general to confine Crocketts battalion to a single part. It is indispensably necessary that he proceed to aid in taking posts to cover the Western Coun- try & occasionally to join Col” Clarke. as little are we able to send any assistance from below the blue ridge as from that Coun- try 5000 Militia are marched and to be marched to Carolina. It is in our power therefore only to approve of your calling on the militia of the Counties before mentioned; and in order to enforce your calls I write to the Lieutenants of Washington & Botetourt. Col” William Campbell is lately gone up to undertake an expedi- tion of another kind. As it now appears more necessary to turn his arms against our internal enemies, I write to him to do so. former experience having proved him very equal to such a duty. In this as in other cases generally active offensive enterprises are to be preferred. It will probably be better to seek the insurgents & suppress them in their own settlements than to await their coming, as time and Space to move in will perhaps increase their numbers. however at this distance we cannot pretend to give precise orders, but leave the direction of proper measures to the discretion of those who will be in command. Should exigencies require it you will extend your call of Militia to such other Counties as may be necessary.

SIR I think it my indispensable duty to lay before you a true state of our situation in this Country since my arrival, which probably may throw some lights on the various reports, which may reach
Page 436
436 ILLINOIS HISTORICAL COLLECTIONS you through channels not so well acquainted with its real wants as I am. On my arrival at the Falls of the Ohio, Colo John Todd gave me instructions to proceed to Kaskaskies, in order to take charge of the goods when arrived, which were purchased by Mº Lindsay for this department, with farther orders to divide them into two parcels, one of which for the troops, and the other to be disposed of to our friendly indian allies: considering it better to sell them on reasonable [terms] than dispose of them in gifts–Horses and ammunition, being articles much wanted for the Troops, I con- tracted for and received a quantity of lead and some horses, before the arrival of the goods, and having discretionary powers, Was constrained to accept of orders drawn on me for provisions which could not otherwise be obtained. Since the goods came into my hands, the troops and Inhabitants at this place not having re- ceived the expected supplies from Government, and being well assured that without some timely relief, the post and settlement must be evacuated, I was also constrained at divers times to issue quantities of the goods intended to be disposed of to our indian allies, in order to furnish them with the means of subsistence. The few troops that are now here are too inconsiderable to guard themselves: nor are the inhabitants much better, not- withstanding they remain in great spirits in expection of relief from Government, and have with great bravery defeated a very large party of Savages who made a regular attack on the village, at day break on the morning of the 17th ult”. Col” Clark has divided his few men in the best manner possi- ble so as to preserve the Country. the apprehension of a large body of the encmy in motion from detroit towards the falls of Ohio, has called him there with what men he could well spare from this Country, before he had well breathed after the fatigues of an expedition up the Missisippi—and Colo Crockett not arriv- ing with either men or provisions, as was expected, has really involved both the troops and settlers in much distress, and greatly damped the spirits of industry in the latter, which till lately was so conspicuous—I see no other alternative, from the present appearance of our affairs, but that the few goods I have left, after supplying the troops, must all go for the purchase of provisions
Page 437
DODGE TO JEFFERSON, AUGUST 1, 1780 437 to keep this settlement from breaking up: and how I shall ever Support my credit, or acquit myself of the obligations I have bound myself under, to those of whom I have made purchases for the troops before the arrival of the Goods, I know not—Our Credit is become so weak among the French inhabitants, our own, and the spaniards on the opposite side of the Mississippi, that one dollars' worth of provision or other supplies cannot be had from them without prompt payment, were it to save the whole Country -by which you will perceive, that without a constant and full Supply of Goods in this quarter to answer the exigencies of Govern- ment, nothing can ever be well affected but in a very contracted Iſlanner. I observe that the distance the settlers, who come in general, to this Country, have to travel, impoverishes them in a great degree. They come at the expence of their all, in full hopes and expectations of being assisted by Government. Were these hopes cherished and supplies of necessaries of all kinds furnished them in the manner of the neighboring Spaniards, to be paid in produce such as might answer for the troops or for exportation, many good Consequences would be attendant. emigrants, on such encourage- ment, would flock to us in numbers instead of submitting to the Spanish Yoke—the principal part of their new settlements would join us. all those from the Natchez in particular, only wait the encouraging invitation to remove themselves and their properties to our settlement, preferring the mildness of our laws to the rigours of the Spanish, which they detest, notwithstanding their great offers. Such encouragement would be a spur to industry which would never die. The troops would in a little time, be solely furnished in provisions by our settlers, and in process of time, a valuable trade might be opened with the overplus. These hints I beg leave to offer to your own better judgement conscious, that if they are worthy of notice you will direct their proper uses. I have got a party of the friendly savages of the Kaskaskie tribe to hunt and scout for us—they are of singular service, as the provisions in store, are totally exhausted, and indeed their hunting \\", \ way afford an useful, yet it is a very precarious supply. As to the general disposition of these indians in alliance with us,
Page 438
4.38 ILLINOIS HISTORICAL COLLECTIONS it appears at present to be very peaceable; but as poverty is always subject to temptation, I fear their good intentions may be seduced by those who have it more in their power to supply their wants, being well convinced of the necessity of having proper supplys for them, which will not only keep them in our interest, but even afford us a very beneficial traffic. The bearer of this travels to the falls of Ohio, thro' the wood. I am uncertain what the fate of my letter will be, as I know he has a dangerous and tedious journey before him—however, by the next opportunity I shall do myself the honor of writing to your Excellency a few more of my observations, begging leave once more, to remark the necessity of keeping at all times, full supplies of goods in this remote quarter, in order to forward the service of Government encourage the settlement of the frontiers, supply our troops with necessaries, provisions &c, and finally open a very profitable and extensive trade in little time. Forgive the freedom of my remarks, which you will please to do me the honor to correct. I have the honor to be Your Excellencys' most obedient and most humble servant &c. &c.

Que rien ne peut etre plus conforme à Leur inclination, aux voeux qu'ils font pour Elle ct pour Leur Liberté; enfin qu'ils font serment par tout ce qu'il y a de plus sacré pour les hommes, de vivre et de mourir dans ces principes. Il est important de faire scavoir à Votre Excellence, que nous sommes en tres bonne intelligence avcc les François Etablis au Détroit, et ceux-cy avec les Canadiens nos parents et amis; qu'ils attendent unanimement que nous commencions les hostilités; parce que nous ne sommes plus sous la domination des Anglois, et qu'un grand nombre d'indiens veulent se joindre à nous. C'est à quoy nous sommes bien disposé, mais entierement dénué de munitions de guerre et des Marchandises necessaires pour faire présent aux nations indiennes qui nous sont aſidées: notre bonne volonté à cet Egard reste sans Effet. [Translatioit.] From the bottom of their hearts and with the frankness which characterizes all good Frenchmen, the inhabitants of the Post Vincennes, formerly faithful subjects of the king of France, dare to avow to your Excellency, that they are ready to join the troops ofthis monarch their former and most worthy lord to act sincerely against his enemies whoever they may be. Nothing could con- form more to their desire, to the vows which they have made for it and for their liberty. Finally they swear by all that is most sacred to men, to live and die with these principles. It is important to acquaint your Excellency that we are in in- tercourse vvith the French established at Detroit, and these with Our relatives and friends, the Canadians; that they wait unani- mously for us to commence hostilities, because we are no longer under the dominion of the English, and because a large number of lndians wish to join us. That is why we look upon this with favor; but find ourselves entirely without ammunition and the So\s wecessary for gifts to the Indian nations who are allied to us; our good will in this respect has no cffect.

440 ILLINOIS HISTORICAL COLLECTIONS 3 Il est d'autant plus affligeant pour nous de manquer de moyens dans une occurrence aussy favorable à nos desseins et propre à nos intérêts, que nos amis du Detroit esperent chaque jour nous voir arriver chez eux pour les delivrer d'un Esclavage qui leur devient de plus en plus insuportable. Leurs Tirants les accablent de Corvées; ils les forcent sous de griéves peines d'aller en guerre contre les Ameriquains alliés de la France, enfin nous apprenons qu'ils sont tellement excedés, et que la Dureté de leur sorts est tellement desesperante que, des qu'ils appercevront le moinôre secours ils prendront incontinent les armes, et avec eux Beaucoup d'indiens que les François ont eu soin de captiver autant qu'il leur a été possible de le faire, en egard à la mediocrité de leur fortune. Il est bon de prevenir Votre Excellence, que ce n'est point sur 1'assistance des Trouppes des Etats Unis que nous comptons pour secouer le joug qui nous opprime outre que les Indiens ne peuvent pas les souffrir et que leur aversion envers eux semble indomptable, nous croyons unanimement qu'il est de saine politique de ne point les recevoir dans nos contrées ou le sang anglois est deja trop abondant. - [Translation.] It is still more unbearable for us to lack means on such a favor- able occurrence to our plans and even to our interests, that our friends of Detroit hope each day to see us arrive among them to deliver thcm from a slavery which is becoming more and more unbearable. Their tyrants crush them with taxes; they force them under severe punishment to go to war against the American allies of France; finally we learn that they are so abused, anô their condition is so hopeless, that from the moment they see the least help, they will take up arms at once, and with them many Indians whom the French were careful to win over in as far as their scanty means allowed. It is well to warn your Excellency, that it is not on the assistance of the United States troops that we count to break the yoke which oppresses us. Besides the fact that the Indians cannot bear them and their aversion towards them seems unbreakable, vve all be- lieve that the best policy would be not to receive them in our lands, where English blood is already too abundant.

Votre Excellence n'ignore surement pas que les François Etablis sur ce continent, ont déja singulièrement souffert, qu'ils ont eu une foule d'obstacles à surmonter, qu'ils ont été cent fois la proix et les innocentes Victimes des guerres sussités par les Anglois, jaloux de la prosperité de notre Commerce avec les Indiens. Libres, nous pourons mettre cent mille hommes sous les armes, les indiens deux cent mille pour la même cause; consequemment [Translation.] We do not wish the Indians who have a common cause with us to be dominated; they abandon the cultivation of their fields to us, and on our side we wish to help them in their need by our works, our industry, and our commerce with them.

Your Excellency surely knows that the French established on this continent have suffered extremely, that they have had a large amount of obstacles to surmount, that they have been a hundred times innocent victims and prey of wars undertaken by the English jealous of the prosperity of our trade with the Indians. Free, we can put one hundred thousand men in the field, the In- dians two hundred thousand for the same cause; consequently,

A la tête d'une petite armée des Etats Unis, Le général Mont- gomery arrivé affamé en Canada; loin de faire la maoindre ré- sistance les Habitans reçoivent, alimentent officiers et soldats ils demandent même les armes pour agir unanimement contre les Anglois; mais on leur en refuse, on veut avoir toute la gloire cueillir tous les Lauriers, on veut conquerir, que fit-on! Une [Translation.] aided by the assistance which we ask now from the King, our common father, to give to us as the events may require, we hope in a short time to become a power and count among the European nations established on this vast continent. From that moment we shall enjoy the works and sacrifices which our predecessors made, we shall be more worthy of the name French, which we bear with pride, and for which we are ready to undertake everything. Perhaps your Excellency has not been well informed concerning the kind of service which the United States troops rendered us in this war; it will be well to give your Excellency a brief outline of it. At the head of a small United States army, General Mont- gomery arrived starving in Canada; far from making the leastre- sistence the inhabitants received and supported officers and soldiers, and even asked for arms to act unanimously against the English; but this was refused; they wished to have all the glory, to gather all the laurels, and to conquer.

MEMORIAL TO LUZERNE, AUGUST 22, 1780 443 apparition subite, une retraite trop promte pour n'etre pas appelé fuite, des dettes considerables qui sont encore à payer, le malheur de plusieurs familles qui se sont expatriées, ct ont rendit les Bretons beaucoup plus surveillants envers nous. De son Coté l'Etat de Virginie poussé d'un zcle par trop ardent à notre Egard, ce zele qu'on peut legallement appeller indiscret, nous a envoyé environ 200 hommes vetues comme les graces a demy nud. Les guerriers ainsy equippés, marchoient sous les ordres du Col: Clark qui venoient nous affranchir et enlever quelques officiers soutenus d'une très foible division de soldats anglois Votre Excellence verra cy apres le resultat de cette officieuse Démarche. Ces trouppes venoient, disoient-elles de la part des François du Congrès; dès lors personne ne s'avise de faire resistance, au contraire on se joint à elles, on va du devant on s'enrolle sous leurs Etendarts, on leur aide à prendre les Anglois, on contient les Indiens qui ne vouloient pas les souffrir, on se dépouille enfin en faveur d'une nation qui se dit être ailiée de la france. [Translation.] A sudden appearance, a retreat too prompt not to be called a flight, considerable debts which are not yet paid, the misfortune of several families which exiled themselves, and the British becoming more watchful over us. On the other side Virginia acting with a zeal too ardent for our interests, this zeal which can legally be called indiscreet, sent tts about two hundred men half naked like the graces. The war- riors thus equipped, marched under the orders of Colonel Clark, vvho came to free us and capture a few officers uphcld by a small · letachment of English soldiers. Your Excellency will see hereafter the result of this officious undertaking. These troops, said they, came on behalf of the French and of Congress. From that time no one thought it best to resist; on the contrary, all joined them; we met them half way and enrolled tindcr their colors; we hclpcd capture the English; we restrained the Indians who wished to resist; and finally; we gave up all for a people who claimed to be allicd with France.

Your Excellency will see how the Virginians honorit. They hastened to flood this country with their paper money, which they said was equalin value to the metal coins and we were good natured enough to accept it as such. They bought all our goods, our horses, our provisions with the pretended money; and when we could not furnish them with any more, they had the audacity to go armed into the publie mills and into the granaries of different houses to take away by force flour or grain destined for our food. Not satisfied with this violence, they thought they had the privilege of a different sort of abuse. They went and shot our cattle in the fields and our pigs in the streets and in the yards and what is worse, they menaced and struck on the cheek those inhabitants, who wished to stop these strange extractions. By these revolting proceedings therefore it has come about that the Virginians have entirely ruined us, and have brought waron us with several lake tribes, from which about twenty unfortunate

Ho Virginiens! si c'est ainsy que vous en usez avec les anciens et fidels sujets d'un Roy puissant Votre allié, si c'est ainsy que vous voulez nous enrichir, nous affranchir, nous rendre heureux, abandonnez nous à la rigueur de notre sort!

They have left us without means of defense by taking away the arms and ammunition which they sent to their forts, so that the Indians of the Wabash who are faithful to us and are our bulwark, tribes to which we can no longer furnish anything, are obliged to hunt with the bow. They have caused more than one hundred young men to leave us, who have gone to find resources in another place. They have forced us to abandon the cultivation of our fields, partly through fear of being killed by parties who come there to surprise us as a fox, and they have been the cause of the death of a great and intrepid Indian chief who was killed in avenging our people, an irreparable loss which we mourn as well as the tribes attached to us. Ho Virginians! if it is thus that you treat the former and faith- ful subjects of the great King, your ally, if it is thus you wish to enrich us, to free us, to make us happy, leave us to the rigor of our fate ! Ifitis thus, finally, that you act with your friends, what treatment do you have for your enemies !

Nous demandons grace à Votre Excellence pour la Longueur de cet ecrit et la Lenteur que nous avons mis à Luy faire Sçavoir [Translation.] t0 your Excellency that strong political reasons and reasons of interest demand it. It cannot be denied, without doing violence to truth, that it was not advantageous to France to be able to dispose at pleasure of a numerous people, whose liberty and attachment for her has been beyond expectation and who have always been ready to join her flag on the least signal when the occasion demanded it. The great trade which we have with the Indians for which we have in return skins, building wood, dried fish, flour, and tobacco Superior to that grown in Virginia and Maryland, horses, coal, different metals which the recently discovered mines furnish and Which we can easily work. These are articles of commerce from Which, we dare say, France would annually derive more profit than she could from the commerce which she will make with United States of America.

CHAPTER XI CLARK'S EXPEDITION AGAINST THE SHAWNEE AND EVENTS TO THE CLOSE OF 1780 RE-ENFORCEMENTs to BE SENT FROM VIRGINIA—Expedition AGAINST THE SHAwNEE, AUGUST 2, 1780—Distress of the INHABITANTS AT FORT JEFFERSON.—SIMILAR CONDITIONS AT THE OTHER WESTERN POSTs. CLARK To Gover Nor JEFFERSON, August 22, 1780. (From the Maryland Journal, October 17, 1780, Draper MSS., 8J136.]" Louisville, August 22°, 1780:” “By every possible exertion, and the aid of Col. Slaughter's corps, we completed the number of 1000, with which we crossed the river at the mouth of Licking on the first day of August, and began our march on the 2". Having a road to cut for the artillery to pass, for 70 miles, it was the 6" before we reached the first town, which we found vacated, and the greatest part of their effects carried off. The general conduct of the Indians, On Our march, and many other corroborating circumstances, proved their design of leading us on to their own ground and time of action. After destroying the crops and buildings of Chille- cauthy, we began our march for the Picaway settlements, on the waters of the Big Miami, the Indians keeping runners continu- ally before our advanced guards. At half past two in the evening of the 8th, we arrived in sight of the town and forts, a plain of half a mile in width lying between us. I had an opportunity of viewing the situation and motion of the enemy near their works. This document was published under the title, “Gen. Clark's Campaign, 1780—Official Letter. Richmond, (Virginia) Oct 4 Extract of a letter frºm Col George Rogers Clark to his Excellency the Governor, dated Louis- Yille, August 22d, 1780.” The present copy is from the transcription by Dr. Draper. .* Compare this account of the expedition against the Shawnee with that given by Henry Wilson, post, 476. 451

452 ILLINOIS HISTORICAL COLLECTIONS I had scarcely time to make those dispositions necessary, before the action commenced on our left wing, and in a few minutes became almost general, with a savage fierceness on both sides. The confidence the enemy had of their own strength and certain victory, or the want of generalship, occasioned several neglects, by which those advantages were taken that proved the ruin of their army, being flanked two or three different times, drove from hill to hill in a circuitous direction, for upwards of a mile and a half; at last took shelter in their strongholds and woods adjacent, when the firing ceased for about half an hour, until necessary preparations were made for dislodging them. A heavy firing again commenced, and continued severe until dark, by which time the enemy were totally routed. The cannon playing too briskly on their works they could afford them no shelter. Our loss was about 14 killed and thirteen wounded; theirs at least triple that number. They carried off their dead during the night, except 12 or 14 that lay too near our lines for them to venture. This would have been a decisive stroke to the Indians, if unfortunately the right wing of our army had [not] been rendered useless for some time by an un- common chain of rocks that they could not pass, by which means part of the enemy escaped through the ground they were ordered to occupy. - By a French prisoner we got the next morning we learn that the Indians had been preparing for our reception ten days, moving their families and effects: That the morning before our arrival. they were 300 warriors, Shawanese, Mingoes, Wyandotts and Delawares. Several reinforcements coming that day, he did not know their numbers; that they were sure of destroying the whole of us; that the greatest part of the prisoners taken by Byrd were carried to Detroit, where there were only 200 regulars, having no provisions except green corn and vegetables. Our whole store at first setting out being only 300 bushels of corn, and 1500 of flour; having done the Shawanese all the mischief in our power, after destroying Picawey settlements, I returned to this post, having marched in the whole 480 miles in 31 days. We destroyed upwards of 800 acres of corn, besides great quantities of vegetables, a considerable proportion of which appear to have

JEFFERSON TO CLARK, SEPTEMBER 8, 1780 455 THOMAS JEFFERSON to CLARK, September 8, 1780. [Draper MSS., 50J56.—L. S.] RICHMOND Sep 8th 1780. SIR Your Letters of July by M. Randolph came safe to hand. In a former letter to you on the Subject of this summer's opera- tions (which I hear you never received) I informed you that the County Lieutenants to whom I had referred to determine on a plan of co-operating with their militia had estimated the expence at 1,995,000 pounds a greater sum that we had in our treasury, could every other demand of money for government have been Suspended. this of course negatived the attempt on a large scale for this season: and indeed no wealth of which we have a prospect will enable us to undertake an expedition on their estimate, while the war continues to the Eastward. I have no doubt whatever but this estimate might by a judicious hand be greatly abridged. Thus disappointed of our first wish, we determined to order 280 militia out, with Colº Crockets men, who tho' principally intended to be stationed at posts, were yet made subject to your orders & expected to be employed by you in active enterprises as long as the Season would admit. Colo Crocket will now march within a few days. in order that you might be supplied with provisions from the inhabited country between the blue ridge & Ohio a Commissary & Quarter master (Mr Boush) was appointed at Winchester and another (Evan Baker) in Washington with orders to forward their provision to you. from the former I have heard nothing, the latter is preparing necessaries for Col” Crocket's march. Our late misfortunes to the Southward will be related to you by M* Randolph. they occasion great calls on our militia & will com- pleatly disable us from further strengthening you this season. I am to ask the favor of you to countersign all demands for money which arise under you. We have been obliged to decline many, which very possibly might be just, because they were drawn by persons unknown to us, & for services perhaps not authorized by you. The Militia accounts incurred in the expedition you are now engaged in must come to the auditors authenticated in the same way. Some Draughts brought by M. Randolph have been rejected for this reason. Yours & Major Slaughter's are duly

I happened to be from this place a fortnight. during my absence this information came, as did M. Randolph. he had occasion to leave town. I returned & withheld the proclamation two days waiting for his return that the peoples orders might be paid off and their money laid out as they had directed in lands at the old price. Unluckily he did not come for several days, & we were obliged to proclaim the law, which put it out of our power to relieve them. As to the choice of the situation on the Mississippi we leave it still, as before, to yourself altogether. I wish it were possible to engage the Piankishaws in war against the British Indians. Should the ammunition sent and to be sent this year to the Westward be insufficient, we will send a further quantity if desired by you.

The inclos'd advice of council pointing out your destination & that of the quotas of militia card from the Western counties, with Gen. Lewis's letter also inclosd, containing his sentiments as to the best manner of executing the intention of the Executive, renders it unnecessary for me to take up that part of the subject. You know that our dependance ison you to direct the march & route of those Militia, and their mode ot proceeding to establish themselves. I have further to add, that as soon as you have an opportunity you are to give notice to Coº Clarke of your movements, numbers of regulars, success in co- lecting the militia, progress in making your establishments & general prospects, and afterwards from time to time whenever opportunities occur to give him like information. The purpose of this is to put it in his power to leave you to pursue the plan chalked out by the Executive, or to take up any other, or call you on any different enterprize which he shall think better, our inten- tion being to submit the disposal of this force perfectly to the will of Colº Clark whose knowledge of the Country to be defended.

TODD TO JEFFERSON, NOVEMBER 30, 1780 467 the way of St. Vincent informs us that late in Oct" a great number of Indians and English were at the late-destroy'd Shawnese Towns waiting the rise of the waters to make a Descent either against the Falls or this place. I have order'd upon duty part of the Mili- tia of this County (Fayette) at three of the most exposed forts and I am purchasing up a quantity of Corn. The people seem fond at Present to sell to the Country and Corn will be almost the only article which Government may expect from the Quarter. I expect to procure between one and two thousand Bushels by giving certificates to be settled by the Auditors or agreed upon by the Commissary for 40 or 50 Barrel or 2-6 hard money. I hope I have not acted amiss in this Respect Altho' I have no Instruc- tions As the Assembly at Session recommended the plan laid by the several County Lieutenants there is a certainty of a vigor- ous attack next Spring I conclude that a Delay for Orders is unnecessary. The Indians are annoying us every week in small parties. Two small detachments of Militia are now in pursuit of Some who stole Horses two nights ago from McConnells Station. A cargo of Goods I have heard is arrived at Fort Jefferson for the Use of the State said to be consigned by Mr. Pollock to myself as Co. Lieut. of Illinois. I purpose writing to Capt. Dodge to store them up until further Orders from your Excel- lency as soon as I shall an Oppertunity & the Report shall be authenticated. I hope to be excused in expressing my Desires that your Ex- cellency may have in Contemplation an Early Expedition next Spring against our savage neighbors. I will venture to assure you that any Orders which ma tend to that purpose will be executed with the greatest alacrity by Officers and Men. Capt.

Williams from the same place to Col. Clark, also an original letter sent by Capt Helm, by which you will learn the situation of the Officers in that Quarter. Such a number of Officers leaving their Posts, & so many of the Men Deserting together with the Conduct of the Commertial Agent & the scarcity of provisions the Crews of the Boats loaded there- with having deserted & Carry'd them off that there is too much reason to fear that the post will be evacuated I have therefore taken the Liberty of ordering the remains of the Country Store together with a large Cargo which is now on its way from Orleans for the use of this State to be brought hither, these reasons will I hope Justify me but when I inform Your Excellency of the number of Complaints against Capt. Dodge both from Officers and Men of the shameful Misapplication of the Goods in his care, and of the Abuses Commited by him in his Department you will think it prudent to prevent this, as there is too much reason to believe he did the former Cargoes.

The Army in this quarter destitute of all kind of Military Stores and none to be purchased; no provisions to be had except Beef, Corn & Salt and all those at most extravagant prices. Inclosed you have the Amount of the Bills Drawn on the Treasurer this Spring & Summer. Money is much wanting to discharge the present contracts which are payable this first day of March next as also to pay the expences of the late expedition. I have as far as in my power supply'd Col” Slaughter's Troops and shall still continue to do so, untill further orders. I am much at a loss how to act relative to purchasing and Issuing provisions not knowing the proper allowances Accounts from the mouth of the River say they have been distress'd in a most extraordinary manner for want of the common necessaries of life which has occasioned many desertions From Orleans we have Accounts that the Spaniards have not taken Pensacola owing to a dispute woh arose between Governor Galvis and the Spanish Admiral relative to the Command of the Forces and neither giving up the point the Siege was laid aside sº the Land Force are now at Mobille under the Command of alvis.

[Draper MSS., 9J21.] There were 200 men in Col. James Harrod's reg', mostly dressed in hunting shirts & breech clouts, some linen & others buckskin. The mouth of Licking was the place of rendevouz. Harrod's men went via the Falls of Ohio, where they were detained a week or two for the boats to get in readiness, & then take them to the mouth of Licking with which for the army to cross the Ohio. While waiting & getting pretty close for provisions, the men had permission to make a two days hunt at the mouth of Kentucky—game was getting scarce there—killed but 2 buffaloes & 6 or 7 deer, scarcely enough to supply their wants while out. Two or three old keel boats & several skiffs & perogues were finally collected together & the troops proceeded up the rivers to the mouth of Ky. & there united with Harrod's men, who had been hunting. With Gen. Clark & the boats were Colº Floyd's & Linn's reg" 'Henry Wilson was in John Allison's company which constituted a pº of Colonel James Harrod's regiment. He was born in Virginia, and in 1779 came to Kentucky. After the attack on the Shawnee, he served as a spy and in the militia for the remainder of the war. He took part in the Battle of the Blue Licks in 1782.

CAMPAIGN AGAINST THE SHAWNEE 477 Every man was to furnish his own provisions. In Harrod's reg' every six men formed a mess, & had a pack horse, to carry blankets, kettle, the axe, parched corn meal and salt. The boats proceeded up from the Falls along the Kentucky shore, made Such a noise that all the game was scared away. A portion of M“Gary's & Ellison's companies, some 30 in all, with M*Gary at their head, agreed to cross over upon the northern shore & hunt along up. They crossed near the mouth of Ky. They had proceeded some four or five miles when they discovered a large Indian camp upon the bank of the river, the Indians immediately fied before M*Gary's party had a sight of them, leaving a couple of bark canoes at the margin of the river, & some half grained deer-skins & jerked meat in camp. As four fires were burning it was evident that the Indians had but just left, & were perhaps waiting in the bushes for the approach of the whites. M*Gary from the smallness of his party, thought it best to return to the Southern shore & join the main force, & ordered Wilson' who was already in possession of the smaller canoe—the larger one having been scuttled by some of the men—to cross & get several boats to convey his men over. Two large pirogues were brought over and while the men were putting in their guns & in the act of getting in themselves, without a sentinel on bank, the Indians finding they were not pursued ran up & fired on M"Gary's men. 9 were killed & wounded. Some of the men, whose guns were at hand, returned the fire. When fired on, some of the men jumped into the pirogues—some behind prostrate timber or logs on the bank. One man was seen to jump out on one of the pirogues, wade ashore & take down the river, & was pursued by an Indian with a spantoon Or spear elevated & aimed in hand. After following some 20 or 30 yards, the Indian stopped & cast the spear which entered the man's back between the shoulders & penetrated through, the point sticking out of his breast—he fell forward, when the spear dropped from the wound. He soon scrambled up & crawled to & crept under some driftwood, which had been cast ashore by some preceding flood. He was shortly afterwards conveyed to the boats. The Indian, who wounded him, made his escape. In MS. is written, “my informant, L. C. D.
Page 478
478 ILLINOIS HISTORICAL COLLECTIONS One Byrn had his thigh broken, and swam to Wilson's frail pirogue some 30 yards from the northern shore—Wilson held him up, until a larger boat came & took him from the water. This was all the work of a moment—the Indians fled. The dead were brought over and buried. The man wounded with the spear, died just before night, & was buried on shore. Byrn & Others wounded, were at evening sent back to the Falls. Byrn subse. quently died; another struck or wounded in the head afterwards died. This little check put a stop to hunting on shore. The men were now on half allowance of parched meal, & almost despaired of continuing the campaign. Near the mouth of Licking, a flat bottomed boat was met, loaded with corn, & destined for the Falls of Ohio for market. This was impressed & divided among the men, according to their necessities, some getting but three quarts each while others got as many as seven. This was used thus: The big ax was taken from the pack horse by some one of each mess, a small white oak sapling about 6 or 7 inches through was cut down, and a stick secured about two feet in length, the butterd was cut off square, & then tapered down like a cone to a point. This was the hominy block. While this was making, another with his tomahawk would make a wooden pestle two or three feet long. The hominy-block was driven into the ground, and a stº deer skin, dried while green, would now be wound around the top of the block, extending some 8 or 10 inches above its top, & made fast with a strong string or tug below — the flesh side of the skin within. Here a pint of corn wil be beaten into coarse meal at a time — three pints of this, cooked into a broth & salted, would suffice for a meal for a mess. A little parched meal would aftsWºr for dinner eaten as they marched along. No jerk either going of returning. Logan's regt from Boonesboro, his own & Whitely's stations went across the country to the mouth of Licking, & reached tº day after the other troops. Logan's was the largest reg', Boon” was with him. There were some 1200 men altogether.

CAMPAIGN AGAINST THE SHAWNEE 479 of the Lit. Miami, nothing occurred, until within five miles of , Old Chillicothe, when the spies returned, gave information that the Indians appeared to be moving off from the town. The army now commenced a run, kept a good smart trot, but when they reached the town about mid-day, they found the Indians had all gone & burnt their own town. Some pots were found over the fires, boiling green corn & snaps. The troops found a great re- lief in green roasting ears & string (snap) beans. That afternoon was spent in feasting & recruiting themselves. The next day the Corn was all cut up, except five or six acres reserved for roasting ears on their return. Marched on to the Piqua town on the Big Miami, reached there about 8 o'clock in the morning, crossed half a mile below the town, water but knee deep. (It sh" be re- marked, that 18 days before, that a fellow stole a horse at Bryan's Station & fled to the Indians & gave them due notice. At the mouth of Licking, unable to get his horse over, rafted himself Over leading his horse behind. The troops found the horse there, & the place where the traitor had camped.) Soon after had Crossed, passing through a prairie, there met a large body of Indians chiefly behind a fence and in a piece of woods. Came Second to the woods, the Indians fired, the whites returned it, & then the former broke & run 200 yards and again rallied & formed On a hill covered with timber. To the right along the stream & just before reaching the woods, was a large corn-field, along the margin of this field & parallel with the river ran a pole fence, behind which were the main body of the Indians — they fired upon the troops but fifty yards as they ran along through the prairie, a little before the party fired in the woods, then fled through the corn, and took a circuitous rout & gained their posi- tion with the others on the elevation. Clark halted the troops in the woods for a few minutes, got the men in order, who had in Crossing the river & running through the prairie, become disar- ranged, and ordered the men in attacking the Indians to press upon them & not suffer them to fire twice from behind the same tree. Thus far none, as was known, were killed on either side, one white had a ball pass thro' his hat & graze the skin on the top of his head. (Capt Haskins) Then marched on up the elevation & attacked the Indians, took trees, pressed warmly upon them, &
Page 480
480 ILLINOIS HISTORICAL COLLECTIONS after a few fires the Indians found themselves so closely pressed, that they would detach some of their warriors to attack the rear. these would have to be met by simply wheeling upon, & a fire of two wº drive them off. The Indians finally retreated a hundred yards off, to a couple of large oak trees wh. lay prostrate in a parallel line, on the top of these were placed chunks and poles stretched along lengthwise on their top forming a very good breast work with something like port holes between the pole & main body of the tree. Here some fifty Indians posted themselves undiscovered to fire upon the advancing whites. Capt Joseph M“Multry, when within thirty steps of the Indian breast work, without knowing that Indians were there, seeing some Indians quite a distance ahead, rested his rifle against a sapling & tumbled over his Indian, who however immediately arose & ran on. Mº- Multry had his horn up filling his charger, when the Indians behind the oak trees all fired nearly at the same time, & though the large body of the men were not more than 200 feet off, but a single man was hurt, & that was Capt M*Multry. A ball completely cut off his right hand fore finger, passing on through the top of his powder horn, shivering it to pieces, & entered his left breast. Four men—Henry Wilson among the number—remained with him. McMultry expecting he was mortally wounded began giving some directions about his affairs & some word for his wife. Wilson wished to mount him on a horse they had with them, fearing the Indians might gain their rear. The wounded Captain desired not to be moved, as he sha not live long, “about as long as a deer shot through the lights.” Wilson thought they had better ex- amine the wound & not take it for granted, without knowing, that the wound was mortal—felt the bullet lodged against the breast-bone. MºMultry inserted his thumb & finger in the wound & flirted out the ball, which has been flattened in passing through the horn, & before entering the breast, making a large wound, it had nearly spent its force. His finger was done up with a handkerchief & then all dashed on & overtook the troops a quarter of a mile off. Wilson, being thirsty, & seeing a spot where he thought might be water, & near the troops ran there, but found none, he then saw three Indians dodging through the bushes —one with a cocked hat on, at whom he aimed & shot through the
Page 481
CAMPAIGN AGAINST THE SHAWNEE 481 belly & fell, skulked through the bushes to a tree top nearby, leaving his military hat where he fell. As Wilson was picking up his booty, Capt W* M*Afee came running to his aid, & both ran up to the tree top, & looking for the Indian, who drew up & shot M'Afee through the body less than ten feet off. A soldier now ran up, When the Indian was pouring powder into his rifle without measuring it—& shot him under the arm. The other two Indians were also shot, & all scalped. M*Afee lived to be carried to the mouth of Licking on a litter, & thence by water to a friends on Bear grass near the Falls of Ohio, his wife was sent for & reached him two days before his death. The Indians were driven from tree to tree, and stand to stand, first in one direction two miles from town, & then in another till finally, about 3 o'clock P. M., they retreated gradually to their fort in the lower part of their town. It was a triangular stockade, covering perhaps half an acre—a new one, just made for the ex- pected invasion of Clarke. Their women & children had all been Sent off some twenty in all, & all the warriors collected in from far & near. By this time the brass Six-pounder, taken by Clarke at Vincennes, was brought up & first put into requision. The men were formed on an elevation above the fort into a hollow-square, excepting Logan & his reg", who were despatched over the river, to prevent their escape in that direction, or over a ford at the upper end of the horse-shoe. The cannon was fired a dozen or 15 times from the hollow-square, the balls shivered the stockade wherever they struck. This hot work, & Clarke's being beyond the reach of their rifles, induced the Indians to divide their men— altogether about 1500—one half secretly left the fort, entered the cornfield which came up close, undiscovered, & thus gained the woods in Clarke's rear. The other half opened the only gate of the fort which fronted Clark & marched out & took position on the flat below, & formed into a single line. It was a novel move- ment & Clarke ordered the cannon to cease firing, thinking they had got tired of fighting & were about to propose to treat. A few minutes dissipated this delusion—a heavy fire upon the rear now opened from the woods along the whole Indian line, this was briskly returned. The Indians on the flat came running in line, & fired when within gun shot. Clark gave strict orders for the
Page 482
482 ILLINOIS HISTORICAL COLLECTIONS men to reserve theirs until the Indians should come close—some of the soldiers along the line, hollered “let them come near enough before we fire that we can singe their eye-brows.” When within forty steps Clark's front some few treed, when near a tree—shower- ed a volly upon the Indians, which mowed them down terribly, & which checked their advancing, & the second fire caused them to retreat. In this action a cousin of Clark's on his mother's side, named Rogers, was mortally wounded, & crept behind a stump. Some of Clark's men were shooting at some of the wounded Indians crawling off, when Rogers hollered out to them not to shoot him for he was a white man. Some 3 or 4 ran down to him, said he was own cousin to Gen. Clark, & wanted to see the General. Clark soon rode up, & remarked he was sorry to see him in that situation, & expressed an opinion that as he knew that army was coming in time to have escaped & joined his countrymen, he sha have done it. He said he had no opportunity, & couldnt. He was taken into the rear & died in an hour or two after. He had been taken prisoner two years before at the mouth of Big Miami. Logan, hearing the heavy fire, crossed at the upper ford & came quickly to their aid. Thus the chief pass was left unguarded, & the Indians availed themselves of it & escaped. Logan, having nothing to do, & hearing so obstinate a firing, was not at all blamed for re-crossing under the circumstances. The Indians in the woods in the rear, protected by trees—and so were Clark's party- stood about four rounds before they scampered to the woods. A few Indians fled to the fort & showed themselves to divert attention, while the main body escaped through a corn field on the flat to the upper ford & crossed. The cannon played upon the fort 4 or 5 shots — the men then rushed to the fort, but the few Indians there, having gained their purpose, scud away through the corn & sought safety in the woods. It was now dark; the army camped in & around the fort—nearly one half were on duty- no countersign given—with orders to shoot at every noise of suspicious object. The next morning a council of officers, decided not to pursue the Indians—they had already a large number of wounded that required their attention; not men enough to leave to protect wounded, it wouldnt do to take them along. Concluded to

CAMPAIGN AGAINST THE SHAWNEE 483 destroy the town & corn, & return. The previous day had been One continued fight from 8 o'clock till night—had lost 20 killed, double that number wounded—had taken 73 scalps from the enemy—some of their dead & many wounded, were doubtless carried off. The greatest loss on both sides was in the action in the town above the fort. Two days were now spent in destroying corn & village—it was estimated that 1000 acres were destroyed. Some thirty or 40 horses were taken, sold at auction at the mouth of Licking where Covington now is; there, too, the army disbanded, & the men scattered to hunt—the roasting ears got On their return at Chillicothe had given out. Camped no supper that night—left next morning. Some of them well nigh starved before reaching the settlements. No commissaries, no baggage Waggons to convey regular rations, &, but too often, day after day without a particle of food, or if any but a sorry pittance of jerk, parched meal, or green corn, snaps or pumpkins—never all these luxuries at once—these were the conquerors of the West, these the protectors & saviors of the country. At Chillicothe on return the corn was found scanty & was appor- tioned. Some few ears of corn to each & some fortunate ones perhaps a small pumpkin or two, went some half dozen miles & Camped. As usual, half the army was on sentry, & so every might until they reached Licking & disbanded. There was only 4 Common sentry on the outward march until they camped at Old Chillicothe, then commenced the half army sentrys, one half of each company one night, & the other half the next and thus alternately. Prior to burning Piqua, the dead were buried in the cabins, & then the houses burned over the graves to avoid their discovery by the Indians—but even this precaution was not sufficient, for the Indians found, disinterred, & scalped them. It was subsequently ascertained from whites returned from ºptivity, that the Indians after their defeat in town, made a stand the next day about half way beween Piqua and where their squaws & children were, & if beaten there, then to sue for peace and save their squaws & children from captivity. No prisoners were taken that campaign. Thinks no Indians ºuld have been killed, as represented by Col. Jef. Patterson,

A powerful army forming by our enemies in the south renders it necessary for us to reserve as much of our militia as possible free to act in that quarter. at the same time we have reason to believe that a very extensive combination of british and indian Savages is preparing to invest our western frontier to prevent the Cruel murders and devastations which attend the latter species of War and at the same time to prevent its producing a powerful diversion of our force from the southern quarter in which they mean to make their principal effort and where alone success can be decisive of their ultimate object, it becomes necessary that we aim the first stroke in the western country and throw the enemy under the embarrassments of a defensive war rather than labour under them ourselves. we have therefore determined that an expedition shall be under taken under your command in a very early season of the approaching year into the hostile country ‘Wrºnted also in Jefferson, Works (fed. ed.), III., 383. 485

The Staff Officers are submitted absolutely to you, and on removal of any of them by you or their death, resignation of declining to act you are to appoint others. The County Lieuten- ants are desired to keep up a constant correspondence with you, & the Staff Officers to inform you from time to time of their prog- ress and to receive your orders. Thus you will perceive that we expect all to be in readiness at the Falls of Ohio by the 15. of March. What number of Men and whether of Regulars or Militia you shall leave to garrison the Posts at the falls & Mouth of the Ohio, is left to yourself. As the latter however is exposed to attack from an Enemy against whom this expedition will be no diversion of force, and as it is distant from succour, it is recom- mended to you to leave it surely garrisoned, and to take meas- ures for its being supported from the Spanish side of the Missisipi should it be necessary. You will then with such part of your force as you shall not leave in garrison proceed down the Ohio and up the Wabache or along such other route as you shall think best against Detroit- By the construction of a fort or forts for retreat at such place or places as you shall think best, and by such other cautions as you find necessary, you will provide for the ultimate safety of your men in case of a repulse. Should you succeed in the reduction of fort Detroit, and a hopeful prospect open to you of acquiring possession of Lake Erie, or should such prospect open during the investiture of the fort you are to pursue it. As soon as you shall have accomplished both Objects of the fort and Lake, or
Page 489
JEFFERSON TO CLARK, DECEMBER 25, 1780 489 shall have accomplished the one and find the other impractica- ble; or as soon as you shall find that neither is practicable you are to consider your expedition as ended, and to withdraw your whole force if you attain neither Object, or, if you acquire one or both of them, to retain for a Garrison at Detroit so many of the Illinois & Crockets battalions as you may think necessary and to send the rest back accross the Ohio; in the event indeed of de- clining to attempt the reduction of Detroit you are at liberty to consider whether some enterprize against the hostile Nations of Indians may not be undertaken with your force, and if you think it can, and that it will be expedient for the public good and eligi- be on view of all circumstances you will undertake it and de- tain your force ’till you shall have finished it. In every event, the Militia on their return are to be marched back to their Counties under their own Officers and there to be discharged.

SIR:- I have the Honor to acknowledge the rec't of yours of the 23rd January last, & am happy to find that you are so abundant as you express—as out of your great abundance I shall expect to receive frequent and large Supplies—more especially in the Com- missary way. The Small Supplies you have sent us, have been of infinite Service, & if you frequently repeat them they will be of singular advantage as we look to you for it, but the supplies I beg may be of a better Quality than what is yet come to hand. The Beef is really of the poorest kind—ill-cured, and not half salted—the Barrels being bad, the pickle became wasted, if ever any had been put in, and tho' the Meat does not absolutely stink, it wants little of it. The approaching Season being warm more especially require that the Troops should be victualled with the wholesomest diet. You well know the ill Consequences of bad Provisions in an Army. I shall therefor only request you w'd not put the State to the Expence of transporting any more pro- visions to us, as I shall not suffer such for the future to be recieved. 'Twere well if all that you send was first inspected. Major Harlan will give you the News of the place IAS have to purchase Supplies in the Illinois it draws away the Liquor from me fast, besides I have to send a Supply to the Opost, & Major Linetot has made a heavy Draft on me for 6 Hogsheads & the half of my Amunition for use of the Indian Department and three Hogshead more to purchase Eight Months Provisions for 25 Men which I have sent for the protection of the Opost and under the command of Capt. Bayly–The Credit of the State is so bad that nothing can be had either there or at Kaskaskia without prompt payment, & when our little Stock is exhausted I know not what we shall do, except you take some Care of us. Send us as much Whisky as you please as we are forced to expend our Taffia for Provisions. The Enemy are approaching the Opost, & fortifying themselves at Miamis, so that the Inhabitants of the * Printed also in Cal. of Va. State Papers, I., 521.

I send under the care of Major Harlan for the use of Mr. Slaugh- ter & Mr. Roberts one hundred wt. of sugar 12 lb soap and fifty weight of coffee &c agreeable to the enclosed bill. I have the Pleasure to drink your Health in a bumper of your good Whisky and the Honor to be your most obed. & very humble Servant, ROBT. GEORGE. I have taken notice of your Song and learned it.

S.]" RICHMOND Feby. 19. 1781 SIR I received your letter on the subject of the backwardness of the Militia of Berkely & Frederic to proceed Westwardly and had before received representations from the Counties. This circum- stance was the more mortifying as we were informed from various quarters that should we persist in the order it would produce an open disobedience. Many circumstances concurred to render it prudent to avoid this. the presence of two armies of the enemy within the State induced us to wish to prevent anything like commotion or opposition to Government in every part of it. As therefore the representations were accompanied with hopes held out of raising a respectable number of volunteers, the board * Printed also in Jefferson, Writings (Ford ed.), II., 460.

508 ILLINOIS HISTORICAL COLLECTIONS thought it prudent to accept of that offer. these two Counties were relied on for 560 men; on view of this disappointment we ob- tained an order from Baron Steuben for Colº John Gibson with his regiment & Heth's company (about 200 regulars) to be added to your command: an addition of more worth of itself perhaps than those Militia, more especially if any number.of volunteers should go. I hope too you will receive greater numbers from Kentucky than we counted on, & aids from the french settlements; we are apt to hope what we much wish, & perhaps this is my case. The inclosed papers give us real concern as they hold out reason to apprehend great abuses in the Western quarter. I transmit them to you to have strict enquiry made (not by your- self for your time is otherwise better engaged, but) by such per- sons of known integrity & Character as you shall appoint. We do not know what to do with the bills of which Major Slaughter speaks, indeed I wish such an enquiry could take place and that the persons you appoint would give their sanction to every bill. The suggestions against the Gentleman who went to Kaskaskias under promise of availing you of it's resources & strength are of such a nature as to merit attention & delicate enquiry. I am sure you will keep your attention alive as to everything of this kind and will use decision where decision is found necessary.

The family settled in Philadelphia, Isaac becoming a carpenter. At the outbreak of the Revolution he entered the navy, but after ten months' Service, joined the army and was present at the battles of Trenton and Prince- ton. In 1777, he was made captain of artillery. Early in 1781, he was 9Idered to Fort Pitt with artillery and military stores. He accompanied Clark down the Ohio to the falls, but towards the close of the year returned to Fort Pitt, where he remained in active service until the close of the war. QH account of his bravery and ability he was advanced to the office of major. After the war, he continued to reside at Pittsburg and for a number of years Was in the employ of the government in a military capacity.

I have just made a Draft of 78 from this County for Col Clarke & if the other Counties draft proportionally your Demand will be fully satisfied. I hear noth- ing as yet of Col. Clark but I concieve I have just cause of expostu- lating with him on account of this County its true state being probably unknown to your Excellency when the Draft was re- quired to be proportioned to the Militia Exposed at every Fort & weakened by daily Removals of its Strength to the South side of Kentucky we are scarcely able to keep our Forts. Should Col Clark take his Rout by the Shawnese Nation all cause of Com- plaint must cease as the Enemy will thereby be drawn off from our Forts Being unable just now to spare Labourers & Guards at a dis- tance from our Forts for making Canoes I have sent Mº Lindsay to Lincoln for Assistance which I make no doubt of procuring I fear I shall meet with some difficulties in conveying the Stores at Lexington & Bryants to the Canoes for want of Horses ours being nearly all taken by the Indians & Col. Bowman does not prove so friendly as I think he ought to be in giving me necessary Assistance. Our Circumstances have received so material a Change within twelve months that a Draft of 18 Militia for the Continental Army at present w" be singularly oppressive upon Fayette or Jefferson Happy sh" we be & readily wuld we spare them if our Situation were but as the Legislature expected There is scarce one fort in the County but once a month seems upon the Eve of breaking for Want of men to defend it Such Residents as had most property & Horses to remove their Effects have retreated to Lincoln one half of the Remainder are unable to Remove, We have no Tax Commissioners in the County & almost nothing to tax All which Circumstances plead I hope in Excuse sufficiently for the Militia at present. Whenever our Circumstances will admit of it the people will Im satisfied inlist voluntarily in to the Continental Army from a Genius they possess for war as well as the Greatness of the Bounty.

State Papers, ii., 47.] JeffeRSON Co., KY. 16th April 1781 SIR, About the first of January last Commissions were delivered me, one appointing me Colo. of the Militia of this County, one other appointing Isaac Cox Lieutenant Colo., also a Major's Commission for William Lyn; five Capt: Commissions together with the Comm’n of the Peace, &c. directed to four of the said Officers, who are Inhabitants of the County, and to three others, one of them being also appointed Sheriff, the other two being in very distant Countys & who have not been in this since their Appointment—I had sometime before the receipt of these Com- missions, heard of the Appointments & foreseeing the Evil which must arise from their not being Magistrates in the County to qualify the Militia Officers, wrote to Your Excellency requesting more Justices to be added to the Commission of the peace & that blank Militia Commissions might be sent me–And I repeated this request soon after the Receipt of the Com'n but have received none others since; nor did I ever receive a single line from you till the 4th Instant when, your two letters, one of the 24th of December & the other of the 19th of Jan: were delivered me. I shall always endeavor to perform the duties of any Office which I undertake, faithfully; and in this particular instance, have done more than my duty required of me. You write me that you had, six months before required of me a proper Return of the Militia of this County; but as the division of Kentucky did not take place 'till November last, your instructions must have been dated before this County took place–But had that not been the case, and had your Letter come to hand, it was out of my Power to comply with it, as we have only four Magistrates in the
Page 530
530 ILLINOIS HISTORICAL COLLECTIONS County, one of whom was so infirm that he could not attend Court at all 'till March last, and then the Officers could not qualify, they being the Justices also; nor is this inconvenience likely to be remedied in a short time as Capt. Sullivan is just returned from Richmond without any Commissions for this County. And as the recommendations made by this Court have not yet been sent away, I fear we shall not get the Commisns. 'till late in the Summer; and until this happens no regular return can be made for want of Offi- cers; Two of the Captains who had Comns. sent, refused to accept of them; one other I never yet have seen, nor can I get him to Court to Qualify. I have endeavored to collect the number of the Militia and find from the best information I can get, they amount to 354, between the ages of sixteen and fifty including officers. You require the Act of Assembly for recruiting the States Quota of Troops to serve in the Continental Army to be carried into execution here, but for the reasons before mentioned it must be postponed; and when your Excellency is informed of the true situation of this County, I am persuaded you will think the Law ought not to have extended to it. We are all obliged to live in Forts in this County, and notwith- standing all the Caution that we use, forty seven of the Inhabit- ants have been killed & taken by the Savages, Besides a number wounded since Jany. last—Amongst the last is Major William Lyn. Whole families are destroyed, without regard to Age or Sex- Infants are torn from their mothers Arms & their Brains dashed out against Trees, as they are necessarily removing from one Fort to another for safety or Convenience—Not a week passes & some weeks scarcely a day without some of our distressed inhabitants feeling the fatal effects of the infernal rage and fury of those Execrable Hell hounds. Our garrisons are dispersed over an Extensive Country, and a large proportion of the Inhabitants, are helpless indigent Widows & Orphans who have lost their Husbands and fathers by Savage Hands, and left among Strangers, without the most common neces- saries of Life. Of those who have Escaped, many have lost all their stocks, and have not any Land of their own, nor where withal

FLOYD TO JEFFERSON, APRIL 16, 1781 531 to purchase—Our dependance to support our familys is upon get- ting wild meat & this is procured with great difficulty & danger; and should it fall to the Lott of some in this County who are thus situated to serve as Regular Soldiers according to Law, their familys must inevitably starve. Our Garrison at the falls is made sufficient to stand an attack with light Cannon, but our numbers which will risk themselves in it, will by no means be sufficient to defend it from an Army which we are frequently threatened with from Detroit—Our Inhabitants being so dispersed that they could not be collected to any one place in the County in less than fifteen days—The Confidence of the People here have in General Clarke's vigilance; his enterprising Spirit & other Military Virtues, together with their inability re- move, have been barely sufficient to keep this County from being left entirely desolate—Major Slaughter at the Falls of Ohio, has about 500 pds: of powder & Lead in proportion, which is all the Public Ammunition in this County; none of that delivered to Col: Bowman last Winter, having been sent me, and there is very little in the county of private property. There is not at this time, I am informed & believe, more than fifty thousand Lbs. of Beef in this County, Fayette & Lincoln; upwards of one hundred thousand Weight of that laid up in this County being entirely rotten & lost–Corn is plenty in Lincoln & Fayette but there is no flour in any of these Counties. The men you order for Genli Clarke's Expedition will be raised with- out much difficulty, notwithstanding all the disadvantages the County is under—The Canoes also shall be ready in time, tho’ one fourth of the Militia must guard while they are on hand. Salt may be had here sufficient for an army of two thousand men Six months, and perhaps more. I am Your Excellency's most Obt. Humb Servt. JNo: Floyd.

DEAR GENERAL–Your favour of the 21 Jany I received the 14th Inst and the next day htose of the 20th of March came to handby Capt Sullivan. the contents of which I sincerely thank you for and to which I shall pay the greatest attention. Those things which make the greatest impression on my mind I shall mention to you first which I fear will embarrass & perplex you exceedingly. All the Beef which was laid in at Squire Boons except about six- teen thousand weight being entirely rotten & thrown away. The quantity I dont exactly know, but it was considerably more than One Hundred thousand. whose fault it was I know not; but as I have given notice to all the Officers & desired them to write by this Express, I hope you will receive proper information. The Beef was to have been pickled at Boons, & poor Evan Hinton who was much engaged about it, was captured by the Indians with two other men as they were going from Lyns with a Waggon Load of Barrells for the purpose of saving the meat. This happened about the 6th of Feby I gave notice to as many of the Commissioners as I could in so short a time to attend for the purpose of enquiring into the charges exhibited by Major Slaughter against the Commissaries & I herewith enclose you the proceedings; as there was only four met it was with some difficulty that this alone could be done, tho' they both were very desirious that farther enquirys should be made but Capº Oldham being called upon as a Witness prevented it. he being one of the Board. Every person seems willing & desirous to forward the Campaisº all in their power. Our proportion of the men for your Army will readily be raised although we are constantly invaded, & among the slain is your old acquaintance Major Lynn, a loss I sincerº lament. Our Garrison at the Falls is finished nearly as You ad- vised. The work was done by Chenoweth last winter, & for which Capt Shannon in behalf of the States is to pay him £15000. Yoº are greatly wanted here by all Denominations of people; & the
Page 533
FLOYD TO CLARK, APRIL 16, 1781 533 Expectation of your coming with an army, and the inability of the Inhabitants by losing their Horses, has kept this County from being left entirely waste. Beargrass can hardly turn out half the number of men it could last year. - What with Boats & Canoes I expect this County will furnish its full proportion or rather more. Salt is plenty enough, and I hope we shall be able to procure some Beeves from Lincoln, and some Butter & cheese will be got in all the Counties. Corn is tolerably plenty in the upper Counties & it is not scarce here, but this is a poor dependance. I have been more infortunate in my little hunt last Winter than the rest. I hired seven or eight men, went to Lees Cabbins with Horses Loaded with Salt, gave £1000 for the Building Canoes, killed & saved 54 Buffaloe 4 Elk & 2 large wild Hogs & brought it down safe to between Goose Creek & Beargrass where my Vessells were overset by a Gale of Wind & sunk my whole Cargo to the bottom. Besides the Meat Tallow &c I lost five Guns, my saddle Bags Surveying affairs Warrants Field Books & all my Memorandums about Land for seven years past. (and as the people say in their Advertisements) & many other articles too tedious to mention— This is my second defeat at Sea; but I am yet alive & hearty. As I have left the Governors Letter open for your perusal it is needless to inform you any thing it may contain and it being all the intelligance I at present recollect. A Recommendation of Officers &c. will soon be sent down recommending Pope as Lieut Col" of Militia I had a hint from Sullivan that this would be very disagreeable to you if so, I shall be heartily sorry and perhaps a line from you to the Governor may not be amiss. as I know you to be a better Judge of any persons Military abilities than any one of our Court.

I think not only our future quiet to the Westward but Eastern events depend much on your success. The enemy at Portsmouth have received since you were here a reinforcement of 1500 Men under Major Gen- eral Phillips. They are at this time under way up James river but to what place destined we know not. The bills mentioned in your Letter are paid on your counter. signature. We lately had a great bundle of Draughts from Colº Montgomery; They were rejected and the holder informed that if he would satisfy you they were for articles or services really for the State, you would countersign and we pay them according to their true value at the time of drawing. You will have received the two hundred thousand pounds sent you by Captain Cherry. We now send Major Harrison three hundred thousand pounds by L. Bradford. All the Stores have gone which were to go for you from this place. A delay was occasioned to the march ºf the Greenbriar Militia by an error in sending some Articles hence to Frederic which should have gone to Fort Chiswell, however they will be in time I hope for the Movements from Fort Pitt. I have just received a Letter from the President of Pennsyl- vania informing me that on learning that Col" Broadhead had re- strained some purchases within their Limits for your Troops he had immediately given orders to have the restrictions taken of and that none such should be laid on any future occasion. I hope that an equal liberality on both Sides will facilitate the future operations of both Governments.

I wrote you about eight days ago upon the Subject of our affairs in this County, but as many accidents may happen to prevent the conveyance of Letters such a distance, I have taken the liberty to trouble you with a second. The want of Militia Officers prevents my getting any kind of duty done by the Militia of this County, and has been the means of many lives being lost. I have but one Captain & not a single Officer below that rank qualified to execute his office as the Law requires. We have but four Magistrates, and three of those are also three Militia Officers which prevents what few we have Com- missioned, from qualifying. I have made several applications to you that more Justices might be added to the Commission of the peace, & that blank Militia Com” might be sent; and untill this is done no regular return of the militia can be made. I have en- deavored to collect the number of our militia, and find from the best information I can get, they amount to 354 including what few Officers we have. You require the Act for recruiting this States Quota of Troops to serve in the Continental Army to be put in execution here, but for the reasons above mentioned it must be defered, and when your Excellency is informed of the true situation of this County, I am persuaded you will be of opinion that that Law ought not to have extended to it. The small num- ber of Inhabitants here is one reason that we are obliged to live constantly in Forts and notwithstanding all the Caution that is made use of forty seven of the Inhabitants of this County have been killed & taken by the Savages since the first of January last, and many more wounded; and of those who have escaped many have lost all their Stock. There is no way here to support a Family but by wild meat, and this is procured with very great difficulty and danger. Indigent Widows and Orphans make up a great part of the In- habitants of this County who are bereaved of their Husbands and

Many have already removed out of the County; and moºr, but the dependance the rest have in Gen Clarkes being enable to defend them; & their own inability to remove; have prevertº this County from being left entirely desolate. The Garrison at the Falls is made sufficient to stand an awaº with light Cannon, but those who will risk themselves ther wil not be able to defend it against any Army from Detroit which wº are constantly threatened with, and I think the last report may be true, as not an Indian has made his appearance in thise Courtº for ten days past, which is very uncommon, & which our inſom" observed would happen some Weeks before a General Invasion Of our Country. the Inhabitants here are dispersed in small Fº over an extensive County and cou’d not be collected any ” place in less than fifteen days; yet I hope General Clarks prºſº" tions at Fort Pitt will prevent our little Settlements from bº destroyed.

About ten days ago I dispatched Hardy Hill, Peter Coleman, and Edward Welsh to you with some Letters, but as there has scarcely been one fair day since, I hardly believe they can get over the Waters by the way of Licking and Sandy Creeks which is the rout they took, and never did I see such floods in small Watercourses as since they went away. and as an opportunity now offers by Mr Jameson it may not be amiss to write again. I have not one word of good news to tell you, but bad as it is I think you ought to know it before you come down. At a moderate computation I think there was one hundred and fifty thousand weight of Beef laid up in this County last Winter for the use of your Army, out of which quantity I believe not more than sixteen thousand is saved the rest being entirely rotten where it lay in Salt. while every one appeared to be engaged in doing what they could to forward this business, and seemed desirous to lay in a large Store of provisions against you come out, the whole bustle is come to what I mention. Mº Lindsey I hear has saved some very good dried Beef, but by what I can learn there is not more than fifty thousand weight of dry Meat in the three Counties, a good many Cattle will be bought in Fayette and Lincoln, and a plenty of Salt will be laid in here. Some dried Beef, Butter Cheese & will be furnished by all these Counties, as every one appears willing to spare every Species of provision they can from their Families.

DEAR GENERAL As Mr Veech is going immediately to the neighbourhood of Fort Pitt, I thought it might not be amiss to write you again although I have nothing of much importance to communicate since my last. The Commissaries are gone to Lincoln to purchase Cattle & other Stores for the Campaign. Mº Lindsay is getting a quantity of Beef dried in Fayette, where the Buffaloe are yet exceedingly numerous. He has also bought some Beeves in that County, and I think one hundred at least will be got in Lincoln, and some few in this County. The old Women seem much engaged in making Butter and Cheese for the Army.
Page 557
FLOYD TO CLARK, MAY 22, 1781 557 M" Floyd tells me to inform you she has about 200 lb of fine cheese for you & desires that you bring her a piece of Linen. Corn is very plenty in the upper Counties, & although it does not answer for a Campaign, it may do to send down to the Iron Bank Station, where I am informed them poor fellows are in almost a starving condition. I am about hiring some hunters to go to Drinnens Lick to lay up some Beef from whence I expect it can be brought in the Canoes from the upper Counties, as I am informed one hundred are to be furnished from those Counties. Salt is plenty, and many articles might be purchased with money, & for want of it the price of every article is almost double which is bought for the State, and its Credit here is really at a very low ebb. Nothing can be purchased for the Troops on Credit at Illinoise where I hear they have plenty. Dodge is gone to Richmond and I hear has all his accounts well authenticated. None of your Troops are yet come out by Land, I had a Letter from Gab' Madison in which he says the Greenbrier Men would not march till the middle of April owing to the Tents, Bags, & Linen for the pack saddles being sent to Fort Pitt by mistake. The Indians have this year suffered us to plant corn on Bear- grass unmolested; the reason of which I expect, is owing to the little Expedition you ordered against some of their Towns early this spring, which has attracted the attention of other Tribes' also: not one has made his appearance here for many Weeks till last Friday, they killed one of the Guard near the Falls where they were preparing Timber for the Boats—Ned Mordock was killed some Weeks ago on the West side the Ohio a little below Salt river. The lower M*Afee's Station was attacked a few days since by a about thirty Indians, they were reinforced from the neighbouring Garrisons and Sallied out & attacked the Indians in the Woods: they got three Scalps wounded several, with the loss of Nathan Lynn & one other man whose name I have not heard. Squire Boon who was badly Wounded at his Station this spring, is likely to get well. It is with much difficulty I can get any thing 1 This doubtless refers to the expedition sent out by Colonel Brodhead, see Introduction, ante, clii.

He wishes well to your expedition, Thinks it will be for the particular benefit of this country & would be happy to have it in his power to Serve it. He has it not in his power at present as The line between the States of Virginia and Pennsylvania is not yet determined. He will not have it in his power even when the line is determined without a special order from the council of the state and then it will only be possible to effect a draught for 2 months If the former officers under the Virginia State effect a draught he thinks it will be well, but does not believe they will find it pos- sible. The people will not submit to it. For his part as a public officer he has nothing to say to it, and as an individual he will acquiesse. He does not find it convenient to wait upon you next Tuesday, but will meet a committee which he understands will convene on Friday next, At Col. Pentecost's and which he

GENTLEMEN, I am honored with yours of the 1* instant inclosing Col. Brodheads representation of the State of Affairs to the Westward, which I make no doubt are in much the same situation as those in every other Quarter. If the requisition for men and supplies are not in any tolerable degree complied with by the States, it is impossible for me to furnish garrisons for the Frontier posts and support them. I have long foreseen the dangers to which the Western Frontiers would be exposed and have made proper representations to Congress and the State of Pennsylvania. The President and Council assert that Col' Brodheads complaints in respect to provisions, flour especially, are not well founded. Why the 8th Pennsylvania Regiment should have been neglected while the others have been so amply furnished with Clothing I cannot say, but I can, under our present circumstances, only recommended [sic] it to the State to endeavour to make a provision for them, as the Continental Magazine, after what has gone to the southward, is exhausted of every article fit for the season. As it seemed the public wish, that the expedition of Coll Clarke against Detroit should be supported, I gave orders to Col' Brod- head to deliver him a certain quantity of Artillery and Stores and to detach Captain Craig with his company of Artillery, as there were neither officers nor men of the Virginia Militia acquainted with that kind of service. I recommended also a small detachment of Continental Troops from the 8th Pennsylvania and 9th Virginia Regiments but it was at the discretion of the Commandant and in case they could be safely spared. I mentioned that I did not imagine the command could not exceed that of a Major and perhaps not of a Captain. If therefore Coll Brodhead saw that the post could not be defended if such a detachment of Infantry was made, he was justifyable by the spirit of my order in not sending it.
Page 563
CLARK TO JEFFERSON, JUNE 10, 1781 563 If Coll Clarke should be able to prosecute his plan, I am of opinion that he will draw the whole attention of the Enemy to the support of Detroit, and upon that presumption I thought the Artillery and Stores might be spared. If he should not matters remain as they were. Upon the whole, Gentlemen, you must be convinced from your very intimate knowledge of our Military affairs that it is out of my power to send any reinforcement to the Westward. If the States would fill their Continental Battalions we should be able to oppose a regular and permanent force to the Enemy in every quarter. If they will not, they must certainly take measures to defend themselves by their Militia, however expensive and ruinous the system.

The news from the Grand army is that Gen' Washington is actually in possession of new york; that the Marquis De Lafayette has got Between Cornwallis and his Shipping; that his fate is inevitable; this comes from Dif" quarters, and all accº seem to agree.

As many of the troops in this Department were quite naked, and all of them thro' want of clothing rendered unfit for a long campaign, the General concluded it would be best for them to remain here, and proposed that I should endeavor to call out as many militia or volunteers as would enable me with the regular troops to make a short excursion against the Wyandott Towns, at the same time that he should begin his march from the mouth of the Miami river against the Shawanese, and which was to be about the 4th of September, and would of course attract the attention of the greatest part of the Indians. Col. Brodhead returned the 11th instant to this place. He informed me that your Excellency had ordered him to return to this post, and that after the depositions were taken relative to the charges exhibited against him, and it would suit his own con- veniency, that then he was to repair to Head Quarters to take his trial.' I then informed him of General Clark's proposal, and at the same time shewed him a letter which I had received from Col. Cannon, a principal gentleman of Yohiogany County, re- questing my attendance on the 14th inst. at Penticost's Mills, as there was to be a general meeting of the county, and that it would be a very proper time to engage the people to turn out, or at least to know their opinion. Previous to this Gen! Clark had informed Col. Cannon something of this kind would be attempted. Col. Brodhead approved much of the plan, and informed me that we would both go, and try what could be done. On the evening preceding the meeting, I asked Col. Brodhead if he should set off the next morning. He then shewed me a letter from Mº Fowler to him, requiring his attendance next day to be present at the taking of the depositions in in support in support of the charges exhibited against him, and said “You see, my friend, these fellows are determined to give me no respite, and that I must have to go down the country soon; I would therefore advise to go and try to * Numerous charges had been brought against Colonel Brodhead of which the chief was speculation with public funds. He persisted, however, in keep- ing the command until September 17, 1781, when by direct orders from General Washington he surrendered his authority to Colonel Gibson. It was then too late to organize the expeditions which Clark and Gibson had agreed upon. For evidence on this controversy see correspondence of Colonel Brodhead in Craig, The Olden Time. II., 398 et seq.

592 ILLINOIS HISTORICAL COLLECTIONS engage them to turn out with you: I shall give you every assistance in my power, and as so many reports have been spread to my disadvantage thro’ the country, my going might possibly retard the people in turning out; besides I might see a number of the d–d rascals who signed the remonstrance, and their presence would be disagreeable to me—in particular that rascal, Col. Cannon, should I meet him I would spit in his face.” The next morning I went to Pentecost's Mills, where a number of people were collected, the principal of whom I informed of my intention. They asked me if Col. Brodhead was to command. I told them the present situation of his affairs prevented his com- manding, that he was obliged to go down the country, but that he had assured me he would give every assistance in his power in furthering the intended excursion. They then asked me to commit my proposals to writing, which I did. The purport of which was, that the 4* day of September should be fixed on as a day of general rendezvous at Fort M*Intosh, that from the unsettled dispute respecting territory, they should consider themselves as volunteers. and choose their own officers, that each man should be well mounted on horseback, and bring with him 30 days provision, and that the whole should bring as many spare horses as would mount 150 regular troops, for which number I engaged they should be paid a generous hire, and if killed, or taken by the enemy, that they should also be paid. They unanimously approved of my proposals, and requested me to go to another meeting the next day, which was to be held a few miles from thence. I went there, and found near six hundred collected, and every one present most heartily agreed to my former proposals, and those fit for service promised to do. The only thing I dread is, that the expedition will fall through, which must endanger the loss of Gen! Clark and his army, should Col. Brodhead persist in re-assuming the command, as the people in general are prejudiced against him, and are determined not to serve under him, tho' with what propriety time must discover. We have been much distressed for provision, owing to the change of the Executive of the State of Pennsylvania in their commissioners of purchase, and the rapid depreciation of the State money; and had it not been for a supply of twenty seven thousand

CAMIPBELL TO CLARK, SEPTEMBER 3, 1781 595 ARTHUR CAMPBELL to CLARK, September 3, 1781. {Draper MSS., 51.J83.—A. L. S.] WASHINGTON Sept 34 1781 SIR It gives me no small pleasure to hear of your arrival at the Falls of Ohio. I hope notwithstanding the very untoward inci- dents that have happened you will be able to do something this Season yet towards chastising our western enemies. A Treaty with the Cherokees and Chickasas were ordered by General Greene. The latter part of July a full representation by Deputies from all the Cherokee Towns met at the Great Island in Holstein and in an humble stile besought Peace which was granted them; but from the late murder of Mº Marshal on the Kentuckey path, I suspect the sincerity of the Tribes and whose conduct may merit them further correction before long. General Washington by the last accounts is carrying on his operations against N. York with vigour. General Greene has nearly recovered the two Southern States that were last Winter occupied by the enemy and I believe Cornwallis's great parade in Virginia, will terminate and properly be called a plundering Expedition. Pensacola, I suppose you have heard is taken by Governor Galvez. The Comte De Grasse, commander of the French West Indian Fleet, has, from good authority beat that of the British commanded by Rodney, and has taken the Islands of Barbadoes and Tobago. Peace or a general War in Europe, will no doubt be determined on, before the opening of next years Campaign I wish we could carry our arms to the banks of Lake Erie, before a cessation would take place; to attempt it farther, might be risking too much. For Canada confined to its ancient limits may serve our present turn: altho' every true American must acknowledge, the advantages that would accrue, could Canada be added to the Union. I shall be glad to be favoured with the intelligence of the Western

CLARK TO THE KENtucky CourNTY COMMIssion ERs, September 5, 1781. [Draper MSS., 51.J84.—D. S.] The Officers of the Counties in the Departm' of Kentuckey in Councill assembled GENTLEMEN-For a series of years past I have made it my study to support and protect the back Settlements of our States, not from any particular Attachment I had to them, but knowing the very great advantage they were of to the Whole Continent as a Barrier against the Indians more valuable than is Generally Con- ceived by the Continent at Large. I have taken every measure in my Power to Support them; sparing no Trouble, Fatigues or Dangers to accomplish whatever offered to Advantage. Sensible that nothing would put a Stop to the War so Vigorously prosecuted by the Indians but the Reduction of the British Indian Posts and possession of Lake Erie, which I have had in contemplation upwards to Two Years. Government fell into those Measures that Promised Success; but from dire necessity recalling Troops they had ordered for the Enterprize Still wishing it to take place encouraging me to persevere in an attempt; the Success of which too much depended on the unsettled sentiments of the Inhabitants of Monongahaia County; Every Effort among them ineffectual (although every- thing that ought to be Dear to them called for their Assistance) it has been out of my power to Collect a greater force than I have at present with me. The whole Frontier have felt the Salutary affect of the attempt, the Enemy watching our motions, not daring to move, or attempt any thing of Consequence, for fear of our giving them, in their absence, some fatal Stroke where they least

CLARK TO THE KENTUCKY COMMISSIONERS 597 thought of, but, I doubt those advantages will subside if no Ex- pedition should take place. They had many reasons to dread the proposed Enterprize, but if nothing of importance is done they will take it for granted that we are not able to prosecute the War encouraged they will come on with double Vigour; I dread the Issue. The publick Clamour against the Settlement of Your Country, being such, I have never ventured to say much in your defence, as it might have deprived me of the opportunity of doing as much for you as I wished; but I know and always knew that this Departm" was of more real Service to the united States, than'half of all their Frontier Posts, and have proved of great importance by engaging the attention of the Enemy that other- wise would have spread Slaughter & Devastation through out the more Interior Frontier, deprived them of giving any assist- ance to our Eastern Armies, and more than probable, the Alle- gany would have been our Boundary at this time. But to give you a full detail of my Ideas on this Subject is unnecessary, I wou'd not wish that you should think that I mean to flatter you by what I have said in [favor] of your Settlements: I could never have Condescended to undertake any Enterprize that only promised advantage to a particular part of the Community. The Gen' good was what I aimed at, as only Consistant with my own Sentiments. It was Immaterial to me from what part of the Frontiers I raised my Army, Could I have got one as their was but the one Common Enemy to act against finding myself disap- pointed on the Monongahalia, I have come to you, & should be glad to know, what you could wish to be done. The forces ordered by Government to be furnished by your Country added to those I have present are not Sufficient to execute anything of moment (owing to the great Desertion that took place on my passage) a greater Number must be Called to the Field; I wait as a Specta- tor to see what a Country is determined to do for itself when re- duced to a State of Desperation; I am ready to lead you on to any Action that has the most distant prospect of Advantage, however daring it may appear to be—Your Situation is truly desperate: The Evacuation of Fort Jefferson has already happened; That of St Vincents will shortly take place–It being out of our power to keep them any longer. Of course the Indians in those Countries
Page 598
59S ILLINOIS HISTORICAL COLLECTIONS must to a Man embrace the British Interest, and you will have several Thousand Warriors more to Contend with than formerly but a small Distance from you: in Short not half the distance from those Valuable back Countries in Virginia as is generally Supposed. It was our Interest on the Ouabache that has pre- served your Settlements; Otherways, Holdston, New River Greenbrier &c must long since have been Depopulated by the Indians or rendered incapable of performing those Services they have done against the British forces in Carolina and elsewhere. But to come to the Point, the whole seems to rest on the following propositions, whether or not, under our present Circumstances; an Expedition Shall take place, if one should be resolved on, what the object shall be: Whether in the Miami Country, or the head of the Ouabache; The propriety of the different Routs and prospect of advantage. All that can be expected from an Enterprize up the Miami would probably be productive of nothing great, it is too late to Destroy the Corn in the Fields, as they will have it secured in secret places as well as their other property, they will fight us, the few we shall kill will be the sum of the Service. If you pene- trate to the Head of the Ouabache it might be thought more pru- dent as it would be acting agreeable to your Circumstances that is desperate. Defeating the Shawnees, Delawares &c is but a Small part of those you will have to Contend with hereafter if you take the latter Route you fall in with the greatest Body of Indians (if some of the Nations did not Join us on our Route) they must fight us as well now as hereafter, if we have Success There is no Route more Convenient to Sandusky, if the Season, and our forces Should admit of our Marching that far. Some stroke of this sort might probably save your Country Another Season From late Occurrences I am apprehensive this will be the last piece of Service that I shall have in my power to do for you, in the Military line and Could wish it to be as Com- pleat as possible (My situation being desperate; Similar Conduct would be agreeable.

However great the disappointment may be to me, I could wish it to center there, and the effects not so generally felt, as I am sure they will, if some speedy and spirited step is not taken, or the war cease with Britain. Such desertion took place among the militia on my passage down, that the forces we had, with what could with propriety be drawn from Kentuckey, could not have amounted to more than seven hundred men—a number although sufficient to defeat the Shawnees, was thought too few to make the attempt proposed, cxcept by the Illinois officers. An expedition against the Shawnees would avail little, as they are but trifling at present in the balance of Indian affairs, particu- larly when they suspected us, and the season so far advanced, they would have had all their corn secured in desert places, the few we should have killed would have been the sum of the service, in lieu of which we must have expended a considerable quantity of the stores on hand, that may answer your future operations, and an enterprise against them appears too trifling when compared with the other, in the execution of which my very soul was wrapt,

606 ILLINOIS HISTORICAL COLLECTIONS as leading to others of equal importance, that I have totally neglected it, & shall display to you my general ideas of our situa- tion and future apprehensions in the Western Department. My former letters will greatly shorten this, as many of them touch almost on every subject. If my ideas are right, I should be more happy if I knew my country had a just one of what they may apprehend—of course they would again endeavor to take those measures necessary. However foreign it may be to most people in power, it is beyond all doubt, that our possessions in the Illinois and Kentucky have been the salvation of all our interior frontiers since the commence- ment of the war, and have enabled them to give that assistance against the British armies they have done. I know a number of gentlemen dispute this assertion; but if the war should continue two years, and no army should march from some part of the States into the enemies country, they will be convinced of their error, which would have been the case by this day had it not been for the preparations and appearance that have been kept up by us the present year. You have been already advertised of the evacuation of Fort Jefferson for the want of supplies, and our few troops drawn from the Illinois, except St. Vincennes, where we still support a garrisor of about sixty men to remain, if possible, until I receive answers from your Excellency. If no army moves early in the spring from this place or Pittsburg, those troops must be withdrawn, or totally lost, with all the Illinois, and the Indians to a man, except the Kaskaskias, will set on us with inveteracy. Two thirds of those formerly in our interest, have already taken the hatchet this fall—the others wishing to suspend the time as long as possible, anxious for us to march an army through their country, as they have been led to believe would be the case, the English reduced. & peace restored. The principal Chiefs and warriors from Wabash came to me on their hearing of my arrival at this post, in hopes of our marching against the English, offering nine hundred men. Their disappointment was great when they found the speeches given them to be vague, and not informed of our real dezign. They concluded we were making preparations for what they wished, and apparently returned well satisfied, with plenty of
Page 607
CLARK TO NELSON, OCTOBER 1, 1781 607 powder, resolved to wait with patience. But necessity will oblige the whole of them to take up the hatchet in a short time to clothe themselves. The Kentuckey, without succours, with the addition of two or three thousand warriors let loose on them, with all the assistance that can be given by the English, must inevitably fall a sacrifice, except strongly fortified, and the distance and inconveniency of travelling from those nations to any part of the frontiers of Virginia or Pittsburg, altho' difficult in the ideas of people in general, are in fact but trifling, and easy to be accomplished. If the mischief was to center here, the consequences might not be so alarming, but the other part of our country will feel the effects. The English having full sway in those countries would vigorously prosecute the war. In protecting the back countries for the preservation of the more interior parts, an army in the enemy's is doubtless the most effectual means (as supplies of goods are out of the question.) Immaterial from whence it moves, or who commands it, if suffi- ciently strong and conducted with propriety, and their object such as promises advantage. Such a one as was proposed last Spring may do the business, although we find that half that number with such reinforcements as might have been had, would have completed it this fall. If I were to recommend the rout of another expedition, it would be through the same channel as the last, as it would be immediately passing through the greatest body of Indians, either friends or foes, where the English emissaries have now their greatest dependence in Indian services in the execution of any design they may have on our frontiers. Add to this, their regaining the Illinois, both Spanish & American, which is perhaps of more importance to them in the Indian department than we generally conceive—Many other reasons might be offered besides the allusion to the terms of peace. I suppose if an expedition is undertaken the next season, it will be by Congress. If by your Excellency, or co-operation with Congress, to enable you better to lay your plans, I have sent Major

If any assistance to an enterprise is to be given from this quarter. the sooner its known the better; but I would not wish to trouble your Excellency with my remarks. I have lost the object that was one of the principal inducements to my fatigues & transactions for several years past—my chain appears to have run out. I find myself enclosed with few troops, in a trifling fort, and shortly expect to bear the insults of those who have for several years been in continual dread of me. I am with much respect.

APPENDIX I The original of Bowman's Journal has not been located. A copy was published in the Louisville Liter- ary News, November 24, 1840 and in the Campaign in the Illinois Country (Cincinnati, 1869). A copy of the original document, then in the posses- Sion of the Kentucky Historical Society, was also made for Lyman Draper (Draper MSS., 47J131 et seq.) by Leonard Bliss, Jr., of Louisville. The following note had been added to the Journal by an unknown con- temporary of Bowman: “This Journal was taken from Major Bowman and revised by a person who was in the expedition. He has kept it for his own amusement, but it does not come near what might be wrote upon such an extraordinary occasion, had it been handled by a person who chose to enlarge upon it. It afforded matter enough to treat on; the season of the year when undertaken, and the good conduct shews what might be done with an army, let the difficulties be what they will. Persevering and steadiness will surmount them all, as was the case with our brave commander and all his officers, not forgetting his soldiers. Although a handful in comparison to other armies, they have done themselves and the cause they were fighting for, credit and honor, and deserve a place in History for future ages; that their posterity may know the difficulty their forefathers had gone through for their liberty and Particularly the back Settlers of Virginia freedom. 611

God save the Commonwealth, Finis. 1791.” The copy here given was transcribed from the manu- script in the Library of Congress, Letters to Washington, 1779, fol. 91 et seq. This is probably a contemporary copy of Bowman's Journal. In a letter to General Washington from Pittsburgh, May 29, 1779, Colonel Daniel Brodhead wrote: “I have the honor to inclose Col. Clark's Journal containing an account of his success against Governor Hamilton of Detroit & the Garrison of post St. Vincent (or Fort Sackville).” The following letters omitted from the text are inserted here. Joseph Bow MAN to John HITE, July 30, 1778. [Almon, Remembrancer, 1779, p. 82.] [ILLINois, KASKASKIAs, July 30, 1778.] “DEAR SIR, “I embrace this opportunity to give you some information of our proceedings since our embarkation from Monongahela, till our arrival at this place. We set sail from thence down to the Big Kanahaw, where we found our men had been confined for eight days, in which time there had been an attack made on the fort, by a superior number of Indians, supposed to be about 200; they killed one man in the fort, and wounded one or two more; but finding themselves not likely to succeed in their attempt, they endeavoured to kill all their cattle, and then made towards Green Briar, where I expected they intended to make a fatal blow- From thence we continued down to the falls of the Ohio, where
Page 613
BOWMAN TO HITE, JULY 30, 1778 613 we erected a small garrison upon an Island, where I left ten or twelve families, with a quanitity of provisions, and a few men to guard them. From thence we continued down the Ohio, moving day and night, with about 170 or 180 men in number, till within sixty miles of the mouth; we ran our boats up a small creek to hide them, not having men enough to leave a sufficient guard. From thence we started for the Illinois, taking four days provisions with us, and in six days arrived at the place in the night, on the fourth inst. having marched two days without any sustenance, in which hungry condition we unanimously determined to take the town, or die in the attempt. About midnight we marched into the town, without being discovered; our object was the fort, which we soon got possession of; the commanding officer (Philip Rocheblave) we made prisoner, and is now on his way to Williamsburg, under a strong guard, with all his instruc- tions, from time to time, from the several Governors at Detroit, Quebec, and Michillimackinack, to set the Indians upon us, with great rewards for our scalps; for which he has a salary of 2001. sterling per year. This town consists of about 250 families, suffi- ciently fortified to have resisted a thousand men; but coming upon them by surprize, they were obliged to surrender themselves. The next day evening I was ordered by our commanding officer (Colonel Clark) with thirty men mounted on horseback, to attack three other French towns up the Missisippi. The first is called Parraderuski, about fifteen miles from Kaskaskias; the town we had in possession; and before they had any knowledge of my arrival, I was in possession of this place, which was no small surprize to them; in consequence of which they were willing to comply with any terms I should propose. “From thence I proceeded to St. Philip's, about nine miles higher up the river, which I likewise took possession of: and as it was impossible for them to know my strength, the whole being transacted in the night, they also came to my own terms. From thence I proceeded to Cauhow, about forty or fifty miles above St. Philip's, which contained about one hundred families; we rode immediately to the commander's house, and demanded a surrender of him and the whole town, which was immediately complied
Page 614
614 ILLINOIS HISTORICAL COLLECTIONS with. I then possessed myself of a large stone house, well forti- fied for war—I was immediately threatened by a man of the place, that he would call in 150 Indians to his assistance, and cut me off. This fellow I took care to secure, but lay upon our arms the whole night; this being the third night without sleep. In the morning I required them to take the oaths of allegiance to the States, or I should treat them as enemies, which they readily agreed to, and before ten o'clock there were 150 who followed the example, and in less than ten days there were 300 took the oaths, and now appear much attached to our cause. But as this is in so remote a part of the country, and the Indians meeting with daily supplies from the British officers, who offer them large bounties for our scalps, I think it prudent to leave a guard here; and being anxious to do every thing in my power for my country, in order to establish peace and harmony once more amongst us, this will engage my attention the ensuing winter. The inhabitants of this country, upon the Missisippi, have, without any kind of doubt, influenced the several nations of Indians in this quarter, as also upon the Ohio; so that 'ere it be long I flatter myself we shall put a stop to the career of those blood-thirsty savages, who glory in shedding the blood of the innocent. For further particulars I must refer you to my brother, the bearer hereof, and I am, &c. Joseph Bow MAN." Joseph Bow MAN to GEORGE BRINKER, July 30, 1778. [English, Conquest of the Northwest, i., 558.] ILLINois–Town of KAskAsKIA, July 30, 1778. DEAR SIR- - I embrace this opportunity of writing to you by my brother Isaac, by whom I shall endeavor to furnish you with every particular [of our] progress since our embarking from the Monongahail, until our arrival at this place. We set sail with a plentiful stock of provisions, and continued down to the Big Kanawha; there I found the men had been close confined to the fort for eight days past, at which time there had been an attack made at the fort by a superior body of Indians—appearing to be
Page 615
BOWMAN TO BRINKER, JULY 30, 1778 615 about two hundred in number. They killed one man of the fort and wounded one or two more, but finding themselves not able to succeed in their attack, they killed all the cattle that they could find, and then made towards Greenbrier, where I expect they in- tended to make a fatal blow. What has been done I have never heard. From thence we continued down the river, landing the salt kettles at the mouth of the Kentucky, and proceeded down to the falls of the Ohio, where we built a small garrison on a small island, and stored up a large quantity of flour and some bacon. Left eight or ten families there, with a few men to guard them. Went thence down the river with about 175 men, until within about fifty miles of the mouth of the Ohio, seeing a great deal of signs of Indians all along the Ohio. We ran our boats, in the night, up a small creek, to hide them, as we had not men enough to leave a guard with the boats. The next morning we started, with about four days’ provisions, and steered a northwest course for the Illinois, and in six days' time we arrived there in the night. We traveled two days without any provisions, being very hungry. Our men were all determined to take the town or die in the attempt. About midnight we marched into the town without ever being discovered. We pitched for the fort and took possession. The commanding officer we caught in bed, and immediately confined him. His name is Philip Rochblave, a Frenchman, who is to be conducted to Williamsburg, with all his instructions which he has had, from time to time, from the governors at Detroit and Quebec, to set the Indians against us and give large rewards for our scalps. This town consists of about 250 families, and was fortified strong enough to have fought a thousand men; but coming on them by surprise, they were obliged to surrender to us on the 5th day of July. The same day I was ordered off by Colonel Clark with a detach- ment of thirty men, mounted on horseback, to proceed up the river Mississippi to three more towns, and lay siege to them. The first I came to was about fifteen miles from Kaskaskia—the town we had possession of-which was called Parradcrushi. Before they had any idea of our arrival, we had possession of the
Page 616
616 ILLINOIS HISTORICAL COLLECTIONS town. They seemed to be a good deal surprised, and were willing to come to any terms that would be required of them. From thence I proceeded to St. Philips, about nine miles higher up. It being a small town they were forced to comply with my terms, likewise. Being in the dead time of the night, they seemed scared almost out of their wits, as it was impossible that they could know my strength. From thence went to Cauhou, between forty and fifty miles above St. Philips. This town contained about one hundred families. We rode up to the commander's house and demanded a surrender. He accordingly surrendered himself, likewise all the inhabitants of the place. I then demanded of them to take the oath of fidelity to the states, otherwise I should treat them as enemies. They told me they would give me an answer next morn- ing. I then took possession of a strong stone house, well forti- fied for war, and soon got word that there was a man in the town who would immediately raise 150 Indians, who were near at hand, and cut me off. I, being much on my guard, happened to find out the person and confined him under a guard, and lay on our arms that night, this being the third night we had not closed our eyes. The next morning I assembled the inhabitants together, and, before ten o'clock, 105 of them took the oath of fidelity to the states. In less than ten days near 300 took the oath from the several towns, and seem now much attached to the American cause. But as this part of the country lies so remote from any other part, and the Indians being always furnished here with goods by the British officers, and offering large rewards for our scalps [I do not think it prudent to leave] this place without a commander, and being willing to do every thing in my power for the good of my country in order to establish peace and harmony once more amongst us, [it] has engaged my attention for the ensuing winter. The inhabitants in this country, along the river Mississippi, have had, without any kind of doubt, the whole influence over several nations in this quarter, as well as along the river Ohio. I can assure you that since the commencement of this war, trade up this river has never ſwords illegible] It is evident that the said Philip Rochblave has done everything in his power to set the

I am in hopes that his correspondence with them is en- tirely at an end, and wish that the executive power of Virginia may deal in the most severe terms with him, as no punishment can be too severe for the barbarity of his former proceedings. As for any other particulars, I must refer you to my brother Isaac. I am sorry that it is not in my power to hear from you, but as I am now at the distance of about twelve or thirteen hundred miles from home, I can't much expect to hear from you or any other of my friends, but if any opportunity should offer, I should expect to be furnished with every particular with regard to the news from the northward, or our present circumstances in general. I, therefore, conclude, wishing you all the blessings of God. Your most affectionate friend and very humble servant, Jos Bow MAN

APPENDIX II This journal of George Rogers Clark gives the earli- est known account of events, after February 23, 1779, connected with the capture of Vincennes. William Myers, who was carrying this official message to Gov- ernor Henry, was killed by Indians near the Falls of the Ohio." According to the custom of the time, Indian agents, instead of sending the originals of important captured letters to their superior officers forwarded copies of such portions as they chose to select. The copy here given was transcribed from the volume of intercepted letters in the British Museum. A copy of this document from the Canadian Archives was printed in the American Historical Review, I., 91 et seq. Three weeks after the death of Myers, Clark prepared another account of the capture of Vincennes. One copy was sent to Governor Henry and one to Thomas Jefferson."

APPENDIX III The original of the document known as Clark's Me- moir is in the possession of the Wisconsin Historical Society. It consists of one hundred and twenty-eight pages of manuscript and gives a detailed account of affairs in the West between the years 1775 and 1779 inclusive. Many early writers on this period have ac- cepted this narrative of events by Clark as trustworthy. But numerous authors of more recent date and notably Theodore Roosevelt in his Winning of the West assert that there is evidence in the Memoir of errors and exag- geration due to the desire on the part of the writer “of trying to increase the dramatic effect of the situation.” “It was written,” wrote Mr. Roosevelt, “at the desire of Presidents Jefferson and Madison; and therefore Some thirty or forty years after the events of which it Speaks. . . . . It undoubtedly contains some rather Serious errors.''' While it would be futile to attempt to prove that the Memoir is wholly trustworthy, it is regarded as worth the effort to try to determine what portions may be approved. In the correspondence carried on between Clark and John Brown, delegate in Congress from Kentucky, it is shown that at least one hundred pages, the greater part of the Memoir, were written in the years 1789 and 1790. The essential portions of these letters are here given. - Roosevelt, Winning of the West, 11., 36, n., 44, 47, n., 55, 57, 63, n. 619

The requisition you make, Sir, by your letter, is such, that a compliance will be, in some degree, destroying a resolution that I have long concluded on, that of burying the rise and progress of the War in this quarter in oblivion; which is in my power, as all light cast on it by another person, must be faint in- deed. Great part of the most material papers are either lost, or made use of as waste paper, and finding my nature such that it was impossible for me to be void of some affection for the people I had suffered so much for, in the establishment of their interests, that I have frequently destroyed papers that were of such a nature that the reading of them would in some measure cool that spark that still remained, and tend to aggravate the crime of the people—that by having nothing about me that might frequently fall in my way and renew my ideas, and by attempting, if possible, to forget the various transactions that have happened, I might again reconcile myself to live in a country that I was always fond of, and with people whose prosperity I have, until lately, studied with delight. For the want of these helps alluded to, it would require time and recollection to collect materials necessary to compose a true narrative of this department. Some papers I can collect, and will immediately set about this business, and as soon as finished, enclose them to you, probably in four or five months. I shall take no other pains than that of stating facts, and occur- rences, &c.

DEAR SIR:— - As to the Narrative; I have been at a great deal of trouble in attempting to recover several copies, that I was in hopes were in the hands of Captains Harrison and Brashears, at the Natchez, and others, but found myself disappointed, and have set about the business without those helps, have tasked myself to spend two days in the week, and have got through about one hun- dred pages. I wish, before I close this business, to receive every querie of importance on the subject that yourself and Mr. Madi- son could imagine. The more I enter into this business, the better I am pleased at the undertaking, and frequently, I suppose, ex- perience the same feeling that actuated me at the time of those transactions. I believe, that through myself, every thing past, relative to this country may be known. If this should fortunately meet with a quick passage, I may probably get an answer from you in two months.

In the Winter of 1779, on the request of Col. G. Mason, of Fairfax, I wrote him a pamphlet that contained great part of our proceedings up to that time. I have wrote to him for it, in hopes that he might find it among his old papers, but have got no answer from him. As he is convenient to you, by post, I should thank you to try and recover it for me and send it by the first opportunity.

Neither Mr Madison nor myself can undertake to propose queries to you not being sufficiently acquainted with the subject, but we fully unite in the request that in collecting materials you will not use a sparing hand.

Brown GENERAL GEO. R. CLARK From the correspondence between Jefferson and Judge Innes of Kentucky it appears probable that the Memoir was completed during the year 1791. “Will it not be possible,” wrote Jefferson, March 7, 1791, “for you to bring Genl. Clarke forward? I know the greatness of his mind, and am the more mortified at the cause which obscures it. had not this unhappily taken place there was nothing he might not have hoped: could it be surmounted his lost ground might yet be recovered. no man alive rated him higher than I did, and would again were he to become what I knew him. we are made to hope he is engaged in writing the account of his Expedition North West of

APPENDIX 6.25 Ohio. they will be valuable morsels of History, and will Justify to the world those who have told him how great he was.” Judge Innes replied on May 30, 1791, as follows: "Since the reception of your letter I have seen Genl Clark and find he is writing the History of his Expedi- tions and will complete the work in the course of this summer.” The period between 1786 and 1789 was, for Clark, one of disappointment and bitterness. He had failed in his expedition against the Indians on the Wabash. The confiscation of the property of some Spanish traders at Vincennes during the same year 1786 sub- jected him to open criticism by the governor and Council of Virginia. His accounts against the state had not been settled and creditors were striving to collect claims for which he had become personally responsible during the couise of the Revolution. That Clark, during these years, at times, drank to excess cannot be doubted, but there is ample evidence to show that he was still in possession of his former physical and mental strength. He gives a glimpse of his own life in a letter to his brother, September 2, 1791, in which he says: “for several years I have lived quite retired reading hunting fishing and fowling hath been my genl amusement and corresponding with a few close friends in different parts of the continent and attention to my private business without concerning myself with that of the Publick, in any point of View.” At that time, he was greatly interested, as he said, * Jefferson, Writings (Ford ed.), v., 295; Va. Mag, of Hist, and Biog., xv., 205 et seq. * Draper M.S.S., 2L29.
Page 626
626 ILLINOIS HISTORICAL COLLECTIONS “in an invention that will give a new turn to the face of things throughout the Western country.” His application for governmental protection, in which he included a rough description of the mechanical process for navigating a boat, was sent to John Brown. “Not being able,” he wrote, “to discover any defect, and further to satisfy myself, I had the machine actually made on a small scale and proved every conjecture beyond a doubt.” For what reason Clark did not complete his application for a patent right as provided in the act of Congress forwarded to him cannot be determined.” It is not surprising that the Indian problem of the period appealed to him and his vigorous nature stood out in the policy which he advocated. There was in his plan the same elements of thoroughness that always characterized his actions in the Indian councils. To him, the policy of the general government, which con- sisted in inviting the Indians to make treaties, in giving them presents and courting their friendship, was in a large measure a failure. “Excell them," he said, “if possible, in their own policy, treat them with indifference, make war on them, prosecute it with all the vigor and devastation possible, mention nothing of peace to them, and you would soon have them suing for mercy. Turn the scale upon them and oblige them to give up a part of their country to pay for the expense of the war, &c. All other policy in the Indian depart- ment, except something similar to this, is the result of the want of judgment or information.” Draper MSS., 27CC29. * This was sent by Brown, April 27, 1790.

APPENDIX 627 The letter relating to the death of Logan's family was written nine years after the time when he was en- gaged on the Memoir. This letter has been accepted as among the most trustworthy evidence on that episode. Referring to Clark at that time, Samuel Brown, through whom the letter was secured, wrote Jefferson: “To those who have the happiness of being acquainted with that truly great man, his statement will bring the fullest conviction. His memory is singularly accurate, his veracity unquestionable. To such a respectable authority I can suppose no one capable of objecting, except Mr. Luther Martin." John Pope describes an interview with Clark during 1791 as follows: “Arrived at his house under an appre- hension that he had forgotten me. He immediately recognised me and, without ceremony, entered into a familiar though desultory conversation, in which I was highly pleased with the Atticism of his wit, the genuine offspring of native genius. On serious and important occasions, he displays a profundity of judgment aided by reflection and matured by experience.” In the further attempt to reach some conclusion on the trustworthiness of the Memoir, comparison has been made wherever possible with other documents of the period. The results are, in general, indicated in the notes accompanying the Memoir. There is abundant proof that Clark, when entering upon the task, strove to collect all his correspondence which bore on the various phases discussed. That he made use of it is evident from his own annotation, such as: * For the account of this letter, see ante, 3 et seq. * John Pope, Tour in the Western and Southern Territories in 1790 (Rich- mond, 1792), 19.

()2S ILLINOIS HISTORICAL COLLECTIONS “See my Letter to him [Governor of Virginia]; “Refer to Major Bowman's Journal;” and “This copy is lost.” There can be no doubt that he made constant use of the Diary, and Bowman's Journal. This Journal gives Clark's proceedings between January 29, 1779, and March 20 of the following year and as it was the work of one of his most trusted followers has always been regarded as one of the best records of the period. His efforts to recover the Mason Letter were fruitless, and Clark's Journal was in the hands of the British authorities. Interest centers especially in the comparison of the narrative in the Memoir and that in these two latter documents. It is seen that numerous incidents are introduced which although they are not mentioned in the Diary or Bowman's Journal are referred to and at times emphasized in the Mason Letter or Clark's Journal. Some of the statements in the Memoir, not included in either of the four documents mentioned, are cor- roborated by other sources, as: the eclipse of the sun at the time of leaving the Falls of the Ohio;” the treatment of Cerré;” division of the goods captured at Vincennes;" disposal of the prisoners;" orders to Cap- tain Shelby to re-enforce Captain Linctot;" deprecia- tion in the value of paper money;’ general confusion at Detroit;" and the defeat of Colonel David Rogers.” ...

APPENDIX ().20 There are other statements made in the Memoir which, so far as has been determined have not been made in any other document. Conspicuous among these are the following incidents: the story of the “antic drummer boy;''' that Clark on one occasion on the march to Vincennes smeared his face with powder before plunging into the water;" that the strong men gave assistance to their weaker companions;” and that food was secured from a canoe, being paddled by some squaws, which was overtaken by some of Clark's men." From these considerations, together with those cited in the notes, the conclusion is warranted that the Memoir is not made up of the reminiscences of an old man who strove for the dramatic in his presentation. The language, stilted on Occasion, notably in the speeches before Indian councils, is not conspicuously so when compared with that used in the Mason Letter and Clark's Journal in describing similar events. Granted that it is not as authoritative on a particular point as either of the three other leading documents constantly cited, for the events described had trans- pired at least ten years before it was written, the Memoir must be regarded as the supplement to each of these in turn and to all of them upon a number of points.
