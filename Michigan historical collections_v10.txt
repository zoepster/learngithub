PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION—VOLUME X In comparing this volume with the ﬁrst edition, not many changes will be found, as the object of the revision was to correct obvious errors and to make brief explanatory comments rather that to substitute the editor’s opinions and style for those of the contributors to the archives of the Society. But even this has called for a great amount of research to verify dates and statements of fact. Only errors obviously due to the carelessness of copyists or printers have been corrected without explanation; where there is a probable mistake, a brief comment, or another spelling of the name or word, has been inserted in brackets. The uual plan of using foot notes, was not available, because, by so doing. the paging of the ﬁrst edition would not have been preserved and the Index to the ﬁrst ﬁfteen volumes would have been of use only for the ﬁrst edition; therefore the notes have been gathered into an appendix, each numbered with the page to which it refers. , The work of revision has been done as directed by the Board of Trustees 'under authority given by Act No. 62 of the legislature, approved April 25th, 1907.

This fact is attested by the abundance of valuable historical material already in the hands of the Committee of Historians, and which continues to accumulate. So abundant has this material become that not infrequently papers of no little interest must unavoidably be laid aside for future reference and use. Attention 'is called to the fact that the present volume, the ﬁrst of its kind, is made up entirely out of this accumulated material, the ﬁrst two hundred nine pages comprising articles of exceptional interest from several of the most enthusiastic contributors to the society’s collections. The balance of the volume is occupied by the “Haldimand Papers,” a small number of which were published in V0]. 9. Since the publication of the ﬁrst installment a strictly chronological arrangement of these papers has been thought to be most advantageous, as presenting a consecutive and con- nected history, and those herewith presented have been arranged in that manner, all documents pertaining to a given year being grouped together. The great interest of these papers increases with prolonged acquaintance, and the committee earnestly bespeaks for them a careful perusal by all in any way interested in historical research. Installments of these papers will appear in several succeeding volumes.

MICHIGAN PIONEER AND HISTORICAL SOCIETY BIOGRAPHY HENRY FRALICK ‘ T“'ELFTII [ELEVENTH] PRESIDENT OF THE MICHIGAN STATE PIONEER SOCIETY Hon. Henry Fralick, Grand Rapids, is a native of New York, and was born at Minden, Montgomery county, on the 9th of Feb., 1812. His father, Abraham Fralick, originally from Columbia county, N. Y., was a captain in the war of 1812. His grandfather was one of a family of 15 boys, 11 of whom were engaged in the revolutionary war, in which four of them were killed; of the seven who returned, all were wounded. His mother was Mary E., daughter of Henry Keller, of Minden, N. Y., who was quite prominent in the community, having been a member of the assembly and the senate of the State. Mr. Fralick received his education in the district schools of his native ‘county and in Wayne county, where his father removed in 1824. The next three years were spent in assisting with the work on the farm, at the end of which time the family removed to Plymouth, Mich. In 1829 he left home to seek his fortune; going to New York, he worked on a passenger boat of the Erie canal for two years, becoming captain of the boat the second year. In 1832, at New Bedford, Mass, he shipped as a hand before the mast, on a whaling vessel bound for the South Atlantic and Indian oceans. On this voyage he was gone two years, touching at a\great many dilterent points, and bringing home a full cargo of whale oil and bone. In 1834 Mr. Fralick shipped as third mate in a merchant vessel bound for Rio Janeiro and other parts of South America. He was gone on this voyage about seven

2 HENRY FRALICK—BUSINESS CAREER months, after which he was engaged for another year on several coasting vessels, when he returned to Michigan. In 1836 he went to Detroit and became clerk at the Michigan Exchange, the principal hotel in the city. Here he re- mained nine months, when he returned to Plymouth, and became clerk in the store of Henry B. Holbrook. In 1838 he bought out Mr. Holbrook’s stock of dry goods, and engaged in business for himself. In a few months he took in as partners Messrs. Austin and Penniman, the ﬁrm name being Austin, Fralick & Co.; and, after carrying on this business for three years, sold his interest, bought a lumber mill, and built a ﬂour mill. After two years he sold his mills to Mr. Austin and again engaged in the sale of dry goods. In 1860 Mr. Fralick sold his store and goods. About a year and a half afterwards he came to Grand Rapids, where he bought out the interest of Mr. Aldrich in the bank of Ledyard & Aldrich; the ﬁrm then became Ledyard & Fralick, and as such carried on a very successful banking business for about ﬁve years, when it was dissolved, and the City National Bank, of Grand Rapids, was organized, since which time Mr. Fralick has been a stockholder and director of this bank. Upon the ﬁring on Fort Sumter, in 1861, he, with his brother and Mr. Penniman, raised, equipped and ﬁlled the muster-roll of the ﬁrst company in the State, which enlisted for three years; and throughout the rebellion he gave his energy and means to aid the government in its vigorous prosecution of the war. In 1867 he again bought a stock of goods, and engaged in the mer- cantile trade for about two years, when he sold out to Mr. Remington and began the real estate business, in which he still continues. In 1872 he, with others. formed the Grand Rapids Chair Company, with a capital of $300,000. Of this company he was director for three years and president two years, when, on account of press of business, he resigned. Mr. Fralick has been justice of the peace, supervisor and county auditor. He has served for thirty years as a school ofﬁcer, and for four years as president of the board of edu- cation of the city of Grand Rapids. He is and has been a trustee and the treasurer of Olivet College for the last six years, and has been a member of the legislature for three dilferent terms. In 1850v he was a member of the constitutional convention, which formed the present constitution of the state; and in 1853 he was elected state senator and was appointed chairman of the select committee on the Maine law question. He presented to the senate a petition, with 100,000 names annexed, in favor of the pasage of the Maine law in Michigan, and in pursuance thereof he presented a bill which, after- amendment, became a law. In 1871 he was appointed by the governor of the state a member of the relief committee for the distribution of the funds sent to help those who were sufferers by the ﬁre which had devastated the
Page 3
HENRY FRALICK—SOCIAL RELATIONS 3 western part of Michigan. To the duties of this committee he devoted, gratuitously, seven months of his time; and the self-sacriﬁcing labors that he~put forth in behalf of these sufferers can never be forgotten. In 1875 he was again appointed by the governor one of the state board of managers to represent Michigan at the national centennial exposition, to the dis- charge of which duty he devoted about ten months; and it was largely to his continued and successful efforts that the state of 'Michigan owes the prominence which she held at the exposition. He has been for many years a member of the executive committee of the State Agricultural Society, and its president for two years; also a member of the State Pioneer society for a. number of years, a member of its executive committee four years and its president one year. In 1837, on the 23d of May, he was married to Corinna A., daughter of Henry Lyon, who was one of the ﬁrst settlers of the town of Plymouth, Mich. Mrs. Fralick died on the 16th of October, 1840. On the 22d of April, 1842, he married Jeannette Woodruif, of Plymouth, Mich. They have four children, one son and three daughters. Being highly regarded for the soundness of his judgment, and ever ready to help by his inﬂuence and coun- sel, he has held for eight years the position of president of the board of trustees in the First Congregational church of Grand Rapids. In the public career of Mr: Fralick, every step is marked by conscientiou effort, based on principle. Emphatically, he is a man of energy, sterling integrity, and un- selﬁsh generosity. A portrait [frontispiece] of Mr. Fralick may be found in this work. FIFTEENTH ANNUAL REUNION OF THE PIONEERS OF KALA- I MAZOO COUNTY AT AUGUSTA, AUGUST 9, 1886 ADDRESS OF WEIJCOME AND BESPONSE—SECRETARY’S REPORT The 15th annual reunion of the Pioneer Association met at Augusta to-day at 11 o’clock. Eight well ﬁlled cars left this city at 10:30 this morning.

4 ADDRESS OF WELCOME—RESPONSE The day was very ﬁne and all went merry as could be asked for. The train stopped at Comstock and Galesburg and arrived at Augusta at 11 o’clock. Here a cordial welcome was given the visitors. The streets were spanned with an arch of welcome, the stores and houses were decorated, ﬂags were displayed, the band played and the people turned out to greet the visitors. In a little while a large company gathered at the grove on the hill where a platform was prepared for the speakers, seats for the audience, tables for the dinner and other conveniences for the guests. After a short season of visit- ing the oral exercises began, opened by music. Then followed the invoca- tion. Then Hon. E. W. Hewitt delivered the following address of welcome: “Ladies and Gentlemen, and the Pioneers of Kalamazoo County: Upon me has fallen the pleasure of welcoming you, and of thanking you for your presence upon this appointed day. ' We will try hard to prove our appreciation of your kindness by doing our best to make the day an agreeable and happy one; a day to which you may look back without a feeling of regret, and with bright hopes of a future _ reunion. We came here young, 'now we are old with not many years before us. We have had our joys and our sorrows in the years that have passed, but let us banish from our hearts all sad and sorrowful memories and enjoy the pleasures of to-day with all the spirit of 50 years ago. Again, let me bid you a hearty welcome in the name of our townsmen. To which President Williams gave this response: In behalf of this audience and the Pioneer Association 1 take great pleasure in tendering our earnest and hearty thanks to the friends and good ' people of Augusta for their courteous reception and untiring efforts to make this occasion everything desirable and long to be cherished in our memories; we are placed under many obligations for the privileges of this meeting in this social capacity in this beautiful grove, arranged for the enjoyment of all present. And who among us is not alive to the sweet associations that give tone and vigor to life? for that is the object of thi meeting in part, to mingle our voices together in the common bond of brotherhood. I see around me here today familiar faces of 50 years ago. of those who have been side by side with us from youth’s manhood to old age. May it not be pertinent for us to ask, where on the dial plate of time are we to-day? Far over the ridge and noon-time of human existence; our history made up,~ and departure at hand. Thus it is through all ages. ranks and conditions. This great culmination of human life is being constantly repeated and again replenished by troops of succeeding pilgrims, and when we are all gathered

SECRETARY’S REPORT—NECROLOGY 5 home to our fathers the world in its routine will move on until the ﬂat vibrates from shore to shore that time will be no more.” The secretary then read his annual report: ‘ Again we are met in annual reunion, once more to greet each other—once more to say “hail and farewell!” perchance again and again to meet—just as likely to meet no more upon this shore of time—one of us to fall, it may be. in the pathway homeward, another to live beyond the period when all his companions shall have passed the portals into the land beyond. “ ’ ' ’ The way of this our world-pilgrimage is full of uncertainties and mystery. Not only the incoming and outgoing of life are hidden with a manifold veil,'but even the short path itself. As around the Egyptian temples, so around the greatest of all temples Sphinxes lie; and reversing the Sphinxes, he only solves the riddle who dies. Since our last meeting with the farmers’ harvest festival at Vicksburg, s0 pleasantly remembered—one of the most delightful meetings of the many that have been held since the ﬁrst reunion at Kalamazoo in 1871—quite a number of the pioneers have bowed their heads, closing their eyes to earthly scenes, and joined the countless host that no man can number in that mys- terious realm beyond man’s ken, seen only with the eye of faith. Among these are many whose existence has been very useful and honorable—men and women. the aged and the youthful, the good, the true and the beautiful, who have contributed their share to the substantial beneﬁts, as well as the sweet amenitie of life, whose place can never be ﬁlled to those most intimate with them—lives precious to the presence and the well-being of kindred and friends and to the world. There have been fewer, it is true, in the twelve months. of great names and of persons of the higher ranks and spheres of political and social matters than in the year before; yet not less useful or beloved in their own circle of acquaintances and in their familiar places in the home and neighborhood that have known and esteemed them. Among these are John I. Hogeboom, aged 75 years; Dr. Melancton Freeman, 86 years; Preston I. McCreary, 80 years; George N. Goodrich, 61 years; Joseph Skinner, 84 years; Horace Sawyer. 79 years; Eli Johnson, 88 years; Harriet “'atts, 85 years; Benjamin F. Smith, 82 years; Peter Kniss, 98 years; Philo D. Clark, 71 years; J. B. Ide Clamax, 70 years; Mrs. Alonzo Thompson, Charles Culler, 74 years; Rev. Samuel Boyles; Richard S. Gagee, in Mis- souri. Oct. 20; Dan Frank. Kansas City, 53 years; Hamilton Wyman, 79 years; Dr. Chapin (though not a pioneer exactly) was a well-known and long time citizen; Bushrod Spaulding; John Coleman at Wayland; Elizabeth Carroll, Kalamazoo, 100 years.

G ADDRESS OF THERON F. GIDDINGS last reunion to continue the annual meetings of the pioneers of this county, and at each and all of them to tell again and again the story of the eanly settlement of this county and to recount the bravery and endurance, the privations, the patient and unremitting labors of the pioneers. men and women, and the noble, unselﬁsh, honest and sterling character, who all were helpful to each other, making common cause of difﬁculties, sharing each other’s trials, disappointments, and sorrows, and rejoicing. too, ‘with those who were successful as if they were members of one family. In the meetings which have been held heretofore very much of the history of those early days and very many of the names of the hardy pioneers, founders of our present prosperity, have been rescued, and placed upon-the printed page for those who came after them to read and to admire. By an amendment to the constitution of our society the election of ofﬁcers is to be held at the annual reunion. That election will therefore take place at the close of the meeting, and I would suggest that a committee be ap- pointed by the meeting or by the chair, as you may deem proper, to recom- mend oﬂicers for the ensuing year. It might be well to appoint that com- mittee now, to give them time to confer and report at the close of the meeting. The officers are: president, vice-president, secretary, treasurer. historical com- mittee and executive committee. With these suggestions I will close the report. Thereon F. Giddings gave in a clear voice his recollections of early Ross. We give below an outline of this interesting paper. In opening, Mr. Giddings made some amusing remarks touching his debut as a public speaker, as this was his ﬁrst endeavor, “but in making such an attempt,” he said, “I had rather trust myself near the spot where I learned my A B (J‘s. feeling that you who knew me in boyhood days, and you who have been my friends in manhood as well, would excuse any shortcomings in my oratory while giving you a man’s recollection of boyhood days spent in Augusta and vicinity 35 years ago.” He claimed to be a pioneer. though the county had a good start, and these old fellows had been here before him; “but I came just as soon as I could, and that was just as soon as any pioneer got here. I was even worse off than the pioneer who boasted that when he came here he had but one shirt to his back. I did not have even- that article of wearing apparel.” He began his career here on Christmas day, 1843, in a family then “living on the territorial road over across the river there in Charleston; I concluded to stay and be one of the family.” * ' ‘ “My father and mother moved from their farm in Charleston to Augusta in the spring of 1847. Augusta was not much of a town in those days. People were few and the houses decidedly scattered, but like some larger cities of
Page 7
OLD TIME ALLUSIONS 7 this day rents were scarce. My father found a habitation then located about where T. G. Wood's store now stands. It was not large but the rooms were as good as a palace. My memory for two or three years succeeding that date is rather imperfect for reasons of inﬁrmities of age (at that time), but I know that the leading and only mercantile establishment was kept in the exchange building by Caleb Kirby. I think the Augusta mills were being built and ‘Clipnockee’ had great expectations during those halcyon days. About 1850 my intellect began to clear and I became a man about town.” Mr.‘Giddings then devoted considerable space to a description of the centers of trade and business ﬁrms. Augusta in those days was not even a ﬂag station on the railroad, for there was no ﬂag. If any one had ambition or money enough to get away from town and take a ride on the strap rail, they stopped the train by getting on the track and swinging hat or bonnet as a signal for a halt. There was no pasenger house needed, and the freight house was anywhere along the track between the bridge and the west switch. Sprague’s store was the headquarters for all the news and gossip, and Fuller- ton’s shoe shop served as a. temple of justice. The people seemed to exist without churches, and education was imparted by Seth Pratt and L. L. Mc- Cloud in the old school-house. The speaker alluded in serio-comic sentences to the old quaking and at times submerged bridge, a band of Indians, to Jed Thompson (afterwards a valued locomotive engineer on the Central), the track walker, to spike down the snake-heads on the railroad. Mr. Giddings mentioned a number of the farmers and the improvements on the east and south side of the river, the Burdicks, Bushes, Cockes, Crosby, Whitford, Bloss and others. In turn the speaker gave a pretty full description of the sections all about Augusta and the names of the farmers, even to Ross Center, at that time and for years the voting place of the town. He concluded his paper as follows: ' “The boys of those days were all good boys. They had to be, because good-sized hazel bushes grew close to town. The most of them grew up to manhood and took up the journey of life far from these scenes. A few yet remain, subtantial men in this their childhoods home. Of those that were men when we were boys, few remain; the majority have passed away to their ﬁnal home and those that are left are living on borrowed time. Soon those original pioneers will be all gone, and then we boys must take up the burden and be the old men and the pioneers for the boys that come after us. May our record he as clear, and their veneration for us be as deep. as ours towards those that preceded us.” Godfrey Knight, who with other pioneers was on the platform, was intro- duced to the audience. Mr. Knight it is claimed is 100 years old, and is cer- tainly a very active man for such an age. Rev. J. T. Robe, the ﬁrst Metho-

Mr. Allen Smith, one of them, was introduced and sang a song, “In this hour of earnest labor,” in a clear voice, though more than 80 years of age. THE POLITICAL CAMPAIGN OF 1840, WITH INGIDENTS, ANEC- DOTES, AND RECOLLECTIONS OF ITS DISTINGUISHED EDITORS AND ORATORS, NORTH AND SOUTH BY A. D. P. VAN BUREN The following is the admirable paper read at the pioneer reunion at Augusta by A. D. P. Van Buren, August 9, 1886. It was prepared at the request of the State Historical Society. All who remember that campaign will recognize how faithful is the presentation Mr. Van Buren has given: Mr. President, Pioneers and Fellow Citizens: The early settlers in this State fought their great battle in the wilderness, during the ﬁrst pioneer decade. At the close of that decade was fought one of the greatest political battles' known in the history of American politics. This battle resulted in the great whig victory of 1840. This campaign was distinguished by a masterly coup d’cta-t of the Whigs, that enabled them to get into power once more. The controlling thought of the whig leaders at the outset was to secure an available candidate for the presidency. Availability in a presidential leader was the inspiring motive of the party. Here a great difﬁculty met them. Henry Clay—the “gallant Harry of the west”—the undisputed head of the whig party. must be disposed of. If nominated he could not be elected. The time had come with him, as it had in previous years with William H. Crawford, “his very eminence had become fatal to him: He was formidable to all candidates, and all combined against him.” Hence the gallant old whig leader. by some strange mixture of whig “algebra and alchemy,” was disposed 'of. For, in the nominating convention. Gen. Scott got 16 votes, Henry Clay 90 and Gen. Harrison 148.

l QUALIFICATIONS OF' CANDIDATES 9 From the beginning of this campaign a bitter political contest was expected—the severest known in our country. The previous success of Gen. Jackson had taught the whig leaders that the military element not only gave eclat to his cause, but gave it an impetus that nothing else could. 'Conse- quently in selecting “General” William Henry Harrison an “odor of gun- powder” would constitute an attraction to rally the masses; and, in the smoke of the coming battle, the enemy would not be able to discover that their nominee did not have the civil qualiﬁcations, nor the brilliant military fame, that Gen. Jackson possessed. But, should they be able to discern this weakness,the statesmanship of John Tyler, the nominee for vice-president, would, by association and reﬂection, cast its glamour over their leader, and they would work up and reproduce his war record so as to dazzle the American people with the military fame of their presidential nominee. On the other side, Mr. Van Buren’s late administration had been very acceptable to his party, and he was renominated with the full assurance of a reelection by the people. The old whig and democratic parties at that time were in the zenith of their political power and prestige. Noble old foes, they had met to decide on this chosen battleﬁeld whether a whig or a democratic president should be at the head of our national aﬁairs for the next four years. Never was a name chosen for a political battle cry with such a magnetic power to electrify and arouse the masses, as the whig shibboleth of “Tippecanoe and Tyler too.” It had the rallying power of, “Old Fritz,” on the , Prussian soldiers, or “Vice Z’Empereur,” in Napoleon’s day on the French people. This battle cry was ﬁrst happily introduced in song by Gen. Louis Grim'er, who wrote most of the whig songs for this campaign. It was, you remember, in the famous song beginning: “Oh what has caused this great commotion—motion, motion, our country through? It is the ball that's rolling on For T ip canoe and Tyler too, for Tippecanoe and Tyler too; And Wit them we’ll beat little Van Van, Van—Van. Oh, he’s a used up man, And with them we'll beat little Van." This song was sung throughout the land. Its liquid notes rolled off the tongues of the singers into the hearts of the people. A very learned and a very wise man has said, “Let me make my country’s ballads and I care. not who makes her laws.” Here the making and the singing of Whig ballads made a president of the United States and the law-makers of the land. If the whig orators were inspired for the occasion, and carried the multitude by the irresistible power of their eloquence, Apollo himself seemed to have given the Whig poets and singers the captivating power of song that carried every- 2

10 WHIG PROMISES thing before it. Never before had the people been so inﬂuenced by the songs of a political campaign. Ossian E. Dodge of Boston, the celebrated singer, was hired to make a tour of the. country and sing at the whig meetings. He came into Michigan with Frank Granger of New York, and sang at a mass meeting in Marshall. In addition to this, Mr. Van Buren and the democratic party had two powerful inﬂuences against them, each strong in itself, but truly powerful when united. One was the 'entire whig party acting as a determined body, the other was “the large league of suspended banks, headed by the bank of the United States," which was desperately in earnest to beat back the democrats and get a national charter. The surest way to do this was to elect a whig president. Money, in political campaigns as well as in war, must furnish the sinews of strength. By mutual support the banks were able to pass their notes as money, and not being subject to redemption it could be furnished without constraint. Consequently the whole interest of this great moneyed power was directed against the democratic party. The press was bought, the debtors were intimidated, and the business pursuits coerced, while the poor man was ﬂattered and cajoled by promises of better times, of speedy reaction in labor which would give him $2 a day and plenty of work. This constituted the soul of whig stock—promises of higher wages and better times. ' Then they began a system of fault-ﬁnding with, and charging of political crimes against, the democratic party. The spirit of grumbling and fault- ﬁnding inspired both whig orator and poet. And they always ended their complaint against the democrats with glowing promises that were addressed to all business pursuits and personal interests of the community. They shouted and sung higher wages to the laboring man. “Two dollars a day and roast beef,” and a hundred other like phrases, calculated to catch the ear, move the heart, and ﬁre the passions of the masses. They harangued the people and made them believe that Mr. Tan Buren’s reelection would be the downfall of all prices, the stagnation of all trade, the destruction of all labor, and the ruin of all industrie. The phrases given out by whig speakers in congress were caught up and re-echoed by the editor and stump-speaker, and made the inspiring theme of song for the hustings. The newspapers in all the trading districts kept the people stirred up with such advertisements as these: “The subsrriber will pay sir dollars a. barrel for ﬂour if Harrison is elected, and thrcc'dollars if Van Buren is. The subscriber will pay ﬁve dollars a hundred for pork if Harrison is elected. and two dollars and a half if Van Buren is.” And so on through the whole catalogue of marketable articles, and through the different kinds of labor. And these advertisements were signed by responsible men, large dealers in the articles mentioned, who were able to ﬁx the market for them. Thus the business, the prosperity, the pecuniary inter- I

POLITICAL DEMONSTRATIONS 11 cats, and the hopes of the laboring man were all to bud and blossom and yield abundant fruit in the political El Dorado that was to be inaugurated if Harrison was elected. No inducements were spared to inﬂuence the passions and the imaginations of men. The democrats taunted the whigs with their nominees‘s having lived in a “log cabin” and drinking hard cider as a bever- age. The whigs seizing the words, adroitly put them to their own use, and gave them a talismanic power in the campaign that the “little magician” was not able to withstand; Immediately the terms “log cabin,” “hard cider,” and “coon skin” were taken as symbols of the party, and to express its identiﬁca- tion with the poorest and humblest of the people. Then began the monster processions and parades. An old campaigner of that time exclaims, “Oh, it were worth ﬁve years of peaceful life to have witnessed the scenes that were then enacted!” Log cabins, as if by the power of magic, sprung up in the crowded marts of the great cities, in the large towns, and in all the small hamlets and cross-roads throughout the country. Each rough cabin was ornamented with coon-skins like the frontier hut, while the cider barrel, with the g0urd dipper in it, was free to all who wished to drink. These rude cabins, thus furnished, were the tabernacles to which all the people were invited to come. They were the headquarters of “whiggery ;” each cabin being a recuiting oﬂ‘lce where the young and old were treated to hard cider, sworn into service and joined the crusade against the democracy. It was by these public gatherings that the ranks of the Whigs were increased. and their doctrines spread over the land. The whig orators and their singers went from place to place like modern revivalists, in Moody and Sankey style, try- ing to convert democratic sinners from the errors of their ways over to the pure doctrines of whiggery. Log cabins on wheels drawn by ten or ﬁfteen yokes of oxen, that were tricked off with ribbons, whig banners and gewgaws, and canoes on wheels ornamented in a similar manner, were a picturesque part of the processions. The great orators, the VVebsters, Clays, Prentisses, McDuﬂies, the Corwins and Ewings addressed the great mass meetings, while the lesser ones harangued the people in the small towns and at the gatherings in the rural districts. The power was practically in the hands of the politi- cians, and it can truthfully be said that the campaign of 1840 produced more politics to the acre than any ten years before or since in the history of this country. For this campaign was the greatest thing that American politics ever did. At Dayton, Ohio, a whig gathering covered ten acres by actual measurement, and the people, like Xerxes’s army, were too numerous to be counted. A whig ﬂag ﬂoated over almost every house in the city, and every ﬂag denoted free access to the building over which it waved. A rough esti- mate of the gathering put it at from 90,000 to 100,000 people. Gen. William

12 PROMINENT JOURNALISTS Henry Harrison, the whig candidate, was there and addressed this mass of enthusiastic whigs. The south, chagrined because Clay was not nominated for president, entered slowly into the campaign, but eventually threw her whole power into it. - The political oratory of that day accomplished ten-fold more than does the stump speaking of to-day. There were but few newspapers then, and the inﬂuence of the orators was supreme when compared with what it is in these times. ' ' This famous political campaign, like those of other presidential elections, had its comic side. And should some of our ambitious authors study the newspapers of those times a mass of genuine wit and humor could be col- lected. The elequent and brilliant speeches, the songs that accompanied them, the jokes, the travestiesy anecdotes and satire. would ﬁll volumes. At the head of the whig journalism of that day was Thurlow Weed, the Warwick of American politics. As editor of the Albany Journal be exerted a powerful inﬂuence in this campaign, and the great whig victory was largely due to him. He had, in Edwin Croswell, democratic editor of the Albany Argus, a foeman worthy of his steel. Albany at that time was the center of New York journalism. 'Gen. James Watson Webb was the Roland of the whig press in New York city, and did good work for the whig cause as editor of the Courier and Enquirer. But he found his Oliver in Moses Y. Beach. democratic editor of the New York Sun. And the General also found. that, after his duel with Beach, he was lamed in one leg for life. _ William Cullen Bryant was at this time an able, reliable democratic editor of the New York Evening Post; while James Gordon Bennett, editor of the New York Herald, was then as ever after, a trimmer' and espoused any party’s cause out of which he could make the most money. But to Horace Greeley must be assigned the post of honor in making the whig songs the most effectual weapon in the presidential campaign of 1840. In that year he started, in Albany, the Log Cabin (ﬁt suggestion to starting them all over the land), to aid in the election of Harrison and Tyler. and threw such force and variety into it that it ran into an immense circulation, and became the basis of the Tribune, established in 1841. A ﬁle of the old Log Cabin, with its whig editorials, speeches and songs, would be choice reading now as giving a good political history of that period. Greeley’s followers sung themselves hoarse for— “Tippecanoe and Tyler too." And the Van Burenites shouted for their favorite in the famous ditty beginning— “When this old hat was new Van Buren was the man, dzc."

INFLUENCE OF POLITICAL ORATORS 13 “Living men,” says a writer of that time, “who saw those days,” will not forget the monster parades of the whigs after the Maine election, when they chorused the popular refrain opening and ending— “Ohl have you heard the news from Maine, Maine, Maine". But, as we have stated, it was by political oratory and song that this cam- paign was made successful. Newspapers being few, the people relied on the stump speaker as their oracle and leader. He was the Moses to conduct them to the promised political inheritance. And they gathered at the bust- ings about the speaker’s stand to hear him deliver the political law and commandments, as the children of Israel did in the tabernacle to hear the law read to them. There were then no short hand reporters towrite down the speech as fast as it was delivered, no telegraph wires to send it to the press two thousand miles away to be put in type the next two hours. and no lightning express trains to scatter one hundred thousand copies of it', in the next twenty-four hours, from Maine to California. That wonderful feat was reserved for these days in which the editor has usurped the place of the pub- lic speaker. But the orator of forty-six years ago had almost unlimited sway over the masses; that was the golden period of political oratory in our country. Pol- itics absorbed all other interests. All work seemed to be laid aside, and every man’s business, especially every whig‘s, was to attend the political meetings; and not only the men but their wives and children ﬂocked to the hustings. It was the year of jubilee for the young folks, who were everywhere delighted with the grand processions and parades, the witty speeches, the singing, the bands of music playing amid all the attractions and display of whig pageant- ry. The'whole whig party had turned into political gypsies, and, with traveling orators went camping out over the country, holding whig revivals, and preaching and singing their political gospel everywhere they went. Steamboats and all public conveyances were crowded with parties singing whig songs, or doggerel ballads made for the occasion, accompanied with the music of drums, ﬁfes and ﬁddles. Political rivalry had assumed most destructive features. The stump speaker, like the border chieftain summoned his adherents about his standard, and by the potent spell of oratory awakened among them an enthusiasm for his cause, a loyalty to his party, a. ﬁdelity to its leader that was worthy of the days of chivalry. The demo— cratic party led by its Roderick Dhu, the whig party by its Fitz James, and the abolition party by its bold McGregor, waged a war of conquest against each other. But that power of the political orator has departed. The press of to-day,
Page 14
14 - WHIGS AT BUNKER HILL as we have said, has taken it from him, for it has not only usurped the power of the stump speaker, but of the politician as well. The press has so instructed and educated the people that they not only do their own reading and thinking, but they have so far solved the political problems and mas- tered the science of government that they have not so much need of instruc- tion from the public speaker as in the old days. It was another master stroke when the whigs called a general convention of all their adherents in New England on Bunker, Hill. September 10. 1840. Fifty thousand New England whigs assembled on that occasion, and a great number of whigs from every other state in the Union met with them. Daniel Webster addressed this vast multitude, and gave a declaration of their prin- ciples and purposes. The report of this great mustering of whigs on Bunker Hill, of Webster’s great speech and declaration of purposes, gave eclat to the whig cause. It was really the grand bugle blast that aroused the whigs to arms all over the Union. It is said that Webster planned the Whig campaign of 1840, and advised them to begin at once holding mass meetings all over the country. That they must raise the whig standard and address the people in all the rural districts of the land. This Was a kind of tactics worthy of a Napoleon. To it undoubtedly the whig party owed their great victory. It was, at any rate, a great hit, and. started a movement that swept like wild-ﬁre over the country, for, as soon as the open-air meetings were started, the “great commotion,” like the Irish rebellion, “broke out forty thousand I strong” simultaneously all over the Union. Says Hugh S. Legare: “The subject'of popular eloquence, always an attractive one in a free country, has been invested for us with a more than ordinary interest in the memorable campaign of 1840.” In this campaign greater multitudes assembled than were ever addressed by those great masters of eloquence, Pericles, Demosthenes or Cicero. The great orator is born of a great occasion. This political campaign inaug- urated in America the out-door mass meeting, which gave birth to that most popular orator known as the “stump speaker.” A history of this great political movement would be very incomplete with- out giving a. full mention of the conspicuous part that the south took in it. The outh, disappointed that Clay was not made the whig standard bearer of the campaign. Achilles like, for a while at least, "sulked in her tent.” But—- “The war that for a space did fail. Now treny thundering swelled the gale." with the battle cry of “Tippecanoe and Tyler too,” throughout the entire southern border.
Page 15
SOUTHERN ORATORS _ 15 The great southern orators, Clay, Prentiss, McDuffee, Crittenden and others, led the campaign against the democracy in the south. But to S. S. Prentiss, “America’s most brilliant orator,” as he is called, must be awarded the highest honors, and the most elfectual work of any orator north or south, in the campaign of 1840. Probably no public speaker of modern times was ever so great a favorite with the nation at large, or ever had such a splendid ﬁeld for the display of his oratorical powers, or, by them, ever accomplished so much for the cause [of a political party. He was continually beSieged with invita- tions to address Whig associations, Tippecanoe clubs, mass meetings, grand conventions, log cabin raisings, mastering at barbecues and Whatever other strange names designated the political gatherings of that annus mirabilis. Hundreds of these invitations, of course, he could not accept. By the most urgent solicitations from northern whigs, he made during the summer of this year, a tour of the northern states, in which he may be said to have been the hero of successive oratorical triumphs. In writing to his sister at this time he says: “I have made speeches at St. Louis, Chicago, Detroit, Cleve- land, Buffalo, Syracuse, Albany,.New York, Newark, Portland,” and many other places. He said in his Portland speech: “Rarely has the history of the world presented such a scene as that now passing before our eyes. We behold this whole nation, from the shores of the Atlantic to the Mississippi, rising up as one man and ﬂocking together in every state, city and village to discuss and hold counsel upon the administration of public affairs.” As illustrative of the people’s estimation of Prentiss as an orator, and of the power of his eloquence, I give the following from a distinguished southern gentleman: “I heard the great speech of William Pinckney upon the Missouri question in the United States Senate in 1820. I sat near by and listened ‘to that of Mr. Clay upon the same subject in the House of Representatives. They were, perhaps, the greatest speeches of their lives. and were most power- ful in their inﬂuence upon the action of Congress. The speech of Mr. Pinckney was perhaps the most ﬁnished and masterly piece. of oratory ever listened to on this continent. That of Mr. Clay was grandly eloquent; Mr. Pinckney’s though admitted to be the most convincing. stirred no feeling as did the burning words of Mr. Clay. A few weeks after I was in the court- room in Columbia, South Carolina, and heard George McDuffee in a celebrated criminal trial. and this was the only speech I ever listened to that I thought approached the eloquence that I have often heard from Prentiss.” As an evidence of Prentiss’s great eloquence I give the following: It was at\ a dinner-table in Newark, New Jersey, in 1844, a ditinguished gentleman, in company with William > C. Daw80n and Chief Justice Lumpkin, of Georgia, and John Bell, of Tennessee, was talking about orators. During
Page 16
16 PRENTISS' ELOQUENCE the dinner a lady present said: “I was tempted once (it was in 1840) to go and hear S. S. Prentiss make a political speech in this city, and he held me spell-bound for three hours. I consider it an era in my life.” “Did you ever hear him, Judge Lumpkin ?"‘ aked the distinguished gentleman above alluded to. “I never did,” was the reply. “Then, sir,” continued this gentleman, “you should seek an opportunity to do so, for certainly he is the greatest master of modern eloquence. I had heard and read much in the current news of the day in relation to his ability and could scarcely believe that heaven had vouchsafed such powers to any man as were ascribed to him. I was discourteous enough to laugh at my lady friend there. who asserted that he had held her spell-bound for three hours. I was incredulous as to the existence of any human power being such as to enchain .my attention for so long a time, and I was tempted to go for once to a political meeting to hear this man from the woods bf the west. I found an immene concourse present. There were at least one thousand ladies seated all around the rostrum in the open air just where you have been peaking today. I wished to be near the speaker and pushed my way, with the privilege of age, through the throng, until, reaching a convenient distance, I found standing room. It was just as Mr. Prentiss rose to speak. I took out my watch to time him. The cheering was vociferous and I failed to hear his commencement and started to replace “my watch in my pocket. I was arrested by a most startling thrill of words and stopped to listen. And I did listen with an attention and interest I had never given to an orator before. So intense was my interest that every faculty, every feeling was concentrated upon the man and the wonderful ﬂow of burning words. It seemed the incarnation of eloquence. There was a witchery in his words clothed in tones so melliﬂuous that they not only cnraptured but stabbed the heart, and I lost the consciousness of passing time, and when he closed I found my hands holding my watch at the pocket’s mouth waiting the power to replace it. I looked at it and found I had been listening for more than three hours, and though over seventy years of age, I felt no fatigue. A friend, a clergyman, who had followed me into the crowd, stood pale and agitated, looking at the man after he was seated. As I approached him he explained: ‘Will you ever again doubt that God inspires 'man?’ ” A similar instance was given to the Writer by E. W. Hewitt, of Augusta, Michigan, who knew Prentiss, and had often heard him speak. Mr. Hewitt says 'he was once relating to John Van Arman, the distinguished criminal lawyer of Chicago, some instances of the wonderful power of Prentiss as an orator, and Van Arman laughed at him, and ridiculed the idea of a man’s having such power. When Van Arman came back from the Mexican war
Page 17
'G. D. PRENTICE—MICHIGAN ORATORS 17 with the Michigan soldiers, he heard Prentiss at New Orleans deliver that eloquent address to the returned volunteers from Mexico. Hewitt, aware of this, when he next met his old friend Van Arman, asked him what he thought now of S. S. Prentiss’ oratory. The reply was: “I can say, like the Queen of Sheba, that you did not tell me one-half about this wonderful orator., I never heard before, and I never expect to hear again, such eloquence from mortal lips.” ‘ I But the prince of all writers in ﬁerce invective, brilliant paragraph, keen wit and pungent satire, was George Dennison Prentice. Beginning as editor of the Louisville Journal in 1831, he soon became a host in the opposition to Jackson, Van Buren and Polk; and his epigrams, bright and sharp, often bordering on the severest personalities, were far more effective than the heavy columns of his editorial foes, Duﬁ, Green, Francis P. Blair, Shad Penn, Thomas Ritchie and others. And yet while Prentice could sting like a hornet, he could sing like a nightingale. It is not often that one who could throw such venom into his paragraphs, could produce such sweet music from his rare poems. As editor of the Louisville Journal, he exerted a powerful inﬂuence towards securing the great whig victory of 1840. ' The northern and southern democrats, as well as northern and southern whigs, seemed to vie with each other in their efforts to defeat their respective foes. Although the democrats did not expect a defeat, yet it was apparent in the early part of the campaign that whigs began to‘ abound in the land. Thus “the great commotion” surged on, sweeping like a mighty wave over the entire country. The result of this monster political revival was, hun- dreds of thousands of the American people “experienced” whiggery, and "Tippecanoe and Tyler too” were respectively elected president and vice president of the United States. THEN, the exultant whigs shouted and sang: “In Lindenwald the ‘Fox' is holed, The coons all laugh to hear it told." Ha—ha—ha, etc., etc. Among the prominent democratic orators in Michigan at this Itime were G. V. N. Lothrop, of Detroit, Edward Bradley, Gen. Isaac E. Crary, Abner Pratt, Thomas B. Church and John VanArman, of Marshall, Charles E. Stuart. N. A. Balch, of Kalamazoo, Flavius J. Littlejohn, of Allegan, and John S. Chipman, or “Black Chip,” as he was called, of Centerville. Who that heard them. can ever forget those eloquent democratic stump speakers. Among the well known whig orators were George Dawson, editor of the Detroit Advertiser, and whom Daniel Webster introduced to the great whig convention of ’40 in Fanueil hall, Boston, as “the eloquent Geo. Dawson of 3
Page 18
18 INCIDENTS Michigan.” Besides him there were James Wright Gordon, and Henry W. Taylor, of Marshall, Horace Mower and Marsh Giddings, of Kalamazoo, and others, all able and eloquent whig orators. Many of the old citizens here present will remember the whig mass meet- ing in 1840 at Kalamazoo, when a log cabin was erected and made the head- quarters of whiggery for the occasion. But who can ever tell how many locofocos’ heads and politics were turned by hard cider that day. The editors of the Free Press and Advertiser were bitter opponents throughout this campaign. The former said in his paper that, at the whig dinner in Kalamazoo, “Dawson and McGraw and their friends ate fried skunk and fricasseed coon.” ' Dawson made, on this occasion, a ringing, eloquent speech that carried the people to the highest pitch of enthusiasm. Sometime before this meeting a malignant libel had been published against him. It came out in hand bill form, and was circulated about the streets of Kalamazoo the day before the ' speech was made. While Dawson was speaking this libel'was handed him with the request that he read it. He took the paper and, looking over the vast crowd before him, said, “I’ll read it, and (referring to the low tone in which a democratic speaker had read a similar paper against himself) I’ll read it loud, too.” Then, holding up the paper, he began to read, giving running comments on each sentence. I wish I could give you every word of that libel and Dawson’s withering comments, but I cannot. I recall the closing sentence: “The whigs wanting an editor for the Advertiser, could not ﬁnd one on earth, so they went to the depths of hell and there found Dawson.” Then, twisting his mouth into comical shape, he replied, “That is the best of evidence that there are few whigs in hell. Any of the scum of hell would do for a locofoco editor.” The two most distinguished and brilliant men of the south, S. S. Prentiss, statesman and orator of Mississippi, and Geo. D. Prentice, journalist of Louis- ville, Kentucky, were each unsurpassed in their own ﬁeld, by any person north or south, in the power each exerted towards the election of Harrison and Tyler. They were both born and educated in New England, and having attained their majority settled in and became adopted sons of the south. And though both so distinguished. they never met each other. . Justice A. R. Brown. of Galesburg, Michigan, rode forty miles to hear Webster speak at Stanhope and Morristown. in New, Jersey, during the cam- paign of 1840. Webster at Morristown spoke from the steps of the hotel and an umbrella was held over him to shield him from the rain, while his ten thousand hearers stood in the rain for some an hour and a half listening to him. At this. time Justice Brown heard Ogden Hoffman and Commodore

RESULTS OF CAMPAIGN 19 Stockton, eloquent whig orators, speak. The old whig party at this time with its Webster, Clay, Prentiss, Choate, McDuﬂee, Corwin, Ewing, Hoff- man and other eloquent speakers overshadowed the democratic party in statesmanship and brilliant oratory. The democrats were sanguine of vic_tory and surpassed themselves in their D efforts to defeat “Old Tip and Tyler.” Dr. J. A. B. Stone, of Kalamazoo, remembers hearing George Bancroft and Peter Parley (Samuel G. Goodrich) make eloquent speeches in Boston on Saturday night before the election on Monday. Bancroft’s peroration was full of hope and democratic fervor. “Fellow citizens.” said he, “I have but one word to say to- you in closing—it is—advance! We mut win in this contest. The whig party has great and eminent men in it; it has Webster, Clay and Choate, but we must defeat it. And I repeat, we must advance, it is now but a short time till the election on Monday next, and, democrats, I say again we must advance to victory on that day.” — But that Monday brought an overwhelming defeat to the democratic party. I was a young democrat then, not old enough to vote, but I felt the tre mendous whipping that the whigs gave us at that time, just as much as if I had been a voter. The old democratic party, probably, never got over the effects of that defeat. But the American people will never forget the splendid ﬁght that this redoubtable old party made in this campaign against its time- honored whig foe. And we shall never forget the gallant ﬁght that its own orators made in this State. In fact it has ever seemed to us that the masterly and eloquent defense of the democratic cause that was made by Edward Bradley, Charles E. Stuart, Flavius J. Littlejohn, General Isaac E. Crary, Thomas B. Church and other democratic orators of central Michigan, won for them, as did the bravery and gallant conduct of Francis I. at the bat- tle of Pavia, all the honors of a personal victory. In truth the democrats had the better cause, and although the Whigs gained the day in 1840, the case was appealed to the people four years later and the democrats won the election. But the reform, the better times, the “two dollars a day and roast beef,” promised by the whigs were not realized by the laboring man. This was pithin put in an able speech made by Thomas H. Benton in the United States Senate some years after the election. There was a cry of hard times and distress throughout the land. Mr. Benton exclaimed: “Distress! What, sir, are not the the whigs in power, and was not all distress to cease when the democracy was turned out? Did not they carry the elections? Has Mr. Van Buren not gone to Kinderhook? Is General Jackson not in the Hermitage? Are democrats not in the minority in Congress. and expelled from ofﬁce every-
Page 20
20 , were PLATFORM where? Were not “Tippecanoe and Tyler too” both elected? Is not whig- gery in entire posession of the government? Have they not had their extra session called to relieve the country, and passed all the relief measures? Yet the cry is distress! and the remedy is—a national poultice of lamp-black and rags!” There were two important planks in the whig platform of 1840, one was “a national bank.” and the other “protection.” S. S. Prentiss, while speak- ing in favor of American industry, in his great speech at Newark, was inter- rupted, either by an honest inquirer or possibly a hostile politician. who loudly cried out to him, “Will not that system make the rich richer, and the poor poorer?” The orator intantly, but courteously, turned to the interrogator and thanked him for putting the question, and then, slowly turning his gaze, with an appropriate and corresponding motion of hi arms, as if surveying the stately ediﬁces surrounding the park in which he was speaking. he said: “My friend, I am informed that. much to the honor of your city, those ele- gant dwellings that adorn this park, and the glittering equipages standing before some of their doors, or now rolling through your streets, belong, almost exclusively, to mechanics, or to the sons of mechanics.“ It is a splen- did testimony to the enterprise, skill and industry of Newark, and enough to gladden the heart of every patriot. But, let me tell you, that but for the blessed inﬂuence of that protection which the government has hitherto afforded our manufacturers, you who have worked in your shops would be doing so now, and you whose sires—to their honor be it spoken—were black- smiths and shoemakers, would be mending the old axes and shoes that they made, instead of occupying the palace~like dwellings that surround us.” One of the great events'of this campaign was Henry Clay’s memorable speech at Nashville, Tennessee, in the autumn of that year. Some four hun. dred of Tennessee’s fair daughters had invited him to speak in Nashville at that time. Over thirty thousand people listened to this eminent whig states- man and orator on this occasion. This speech was one of the most eloquent of the campaign. _ _ Was ever personal inﬂuence used with such effect before as by ‘the whigs in this election? Who will ever be able to tell how many thousands were induced to vote for “old Tip” by a glass of hard cider or a Whig dinner? The latch string to every log cabin was out, and, as it was said, every democrat who entered and partook of the hospitality within, by some strange infatuation, came out a Whig voter. ' Nicknames and invective were used as legitimate weapons in this contest. Gen. Jackson was called “old Hickory,” hence the hickory tree was an emblem of democracy. General Harrison was called “Tippecanoe” or “old

THOMAS CORWIN 21 Tip” from the victory he won over “the Prophet.” Tecumseh’s brdther at the battle of Tippecanoe. The canoe, ﬁlled with singing girls, that formed such a picturesque part in the whig processions, with the miniature log cabin and other pageantry, was a symbol for Tippecanoe. The whigs built their log cabins entirely of oak. They were very careful not to have any hickory in them, as that was a locofoco emblem. Webster was called “the dark browed and sunken eyed ;” Van Buren, the “Fox,” or “Little Magician ;” Thomas Ewing, “the crafty and cruel;” Frank Granger, “the pitiless and remorse less.” A whig couplet touched off Thomas H. Benton and Amos Kendall—- “There's Benton, the braggart, full of humbug and salt, And heaven-born Amos, unspotted with fault." When Mr. Gouge‘s work on banking came out, Amos Kendall said, “I have heard a great deal about banks on gouging, but this is the ﬁrst I ever heard of Gouge on banking.” Every device was resorted to to further on the whig cause. Medals about the size of a silver dollar, with a log cabin on one side and a bust of “old Tip” on the other, were made and sold for a triﬂe to the children, who wore them, and what pleased the child did also the man, for everybody wore these baubles. Thomas Corwin, the statesman, orator and prince of stump speakers, was at this time in the full vigor and freshness of his unmatched faculties. Wit, humor. poetry, logic, anecdote, graphic power of illustration, an inimitable mimic and racontcur, a classical scholar and profound reasoner, he lacked nothing as a popular orator to captivate, convince and carry the crowd with him. A friend of the writer’s went some forty miles during this campaign to hear Corwin speak. It was at a mass meeting in Ohio. As Corwin came upon the stand he bowed, and, without saying one word, he took a large wooden knife, and with it cut a. huge johnnycake that was on the table before him. into small pieces. Then laying the knife down he took a piece of the johnnycake and threw it out among the- crowd. Thus he continued till every piece of the cake had been thrown among the vest audience before him. Then looking intently a moment at the wondering crowd he exclaimed, "Thus, fellow-citizens, the government at Washington is squandering the public moneys among its favorites all over the union.” Then, after this most forcible and impressive illustration of how the democratic administra- tion was squandering the public fund, he began his speech, or rather con- tinued it, for no one in that vast multitude before him ever forgot that most happy illustration at the beginning of one of the greatest speeches they ever
Page 22
22 THE SOUTHERN BARBECUE listened to. Somebody has said “it was worth going twenty miles to hear John Randolph say ‘Mr. President.”’ When it was announced that Tom (Jorwin was to speak in any part of the country distance seemed to be out of the question—it never was too far to go and hear him. Who shall attempt to estimate the inﬂuence Tom Corwin‘s speeches had in the election of Gen. Harrison? That inﬂuence was powerful in securing the great whig victory. The barbecue, although known in some parts of the north, belongs exclu- sively to the south, and one must have seen it and engaged in it in this south- ern clime, to have known what it really was. W'hile sojourning in Mississippi some years after this campaign and while its memories were yet fresh and vivid in the minds of the people, the writer heard frequent mention made of the “barbecues of 1840.” And among them was one that awakened memories of distinguished southern orators who had made the occasion one- never to be forgotten by their brilliant speeches. This barbecue was on Colonel Heborn‘s plantation, which was about half way between Vicksburg and Jackson. Col. Heborn. one of Mississippi’s chiv- alrous sons, had invited the people generally, whigs and democrats alike. to this barbecue. A large company of young men mounted on horses in true cavalier style. and came from J ackson. Among them was E. W. Hewitt, refer- red to above. who has given the writer additional particulars concerning this 'gathering. It was held in a beautiful grove on the plantation. Seats were arranged about the stand in a half circle, while ladies in their carriages formed a._picturesqne group in the rear. After a bounteous feast had been enjoyed, Col. Heborn, master of cere- monies, took his seat on the speaker’s stand with the distinguished guests seated on either side of him. Each of the speakers selected was to consider himself a “free lance” in the discussion of whatever subject he might choose. Governor Jones, of Tennessee, a staunch whig, was ﬁrst called out. He, tak- ing the occasion as a golden opportunity, made a telling whig speech that brought rounds of applause from the enthusiastic crowd. He was followed by Robert J. Walker, democrat of the manor born. It is needless for me to say that he could make a good after-dinner or platform speech. The man who could capture a national democratic convention as he did that of Balti- more in 1844, when. he was the dextrous Saladin who met B. F. Butler, the champion of the Van Buren cause in that convention, and after defeating him by a masterly speech, carried James K. Polk against all opposition info a triumphant nomination by that body.- Such an orator was ready for any occasion, and he now made a. speech whose potency and convincing logic seemed to sweep the ﬁrst speaker’s argument away like cobwebs. But before closing he referred to the distinguished orator S. S. Prentiss who was to fol-
Page 23
THE SOUTHERN BARBECUE . 23 low him. “I know. fellow citizens, that he will captivate you by the charm of his oratory and win you and convince you by the wierd power of his argument. Yes. and I shall be sitting there on the seat beside you, and shall also be won over and convinced with you.” And Mr. Walker took his seat. Col. Heborn then introduced S. S. Prentiss, “the eloquent Bayard of the south.” The occasion, graced and honored by the reﬁned audience composed of the beauty and chivalry of Mississippi. the ditinguished speakers present, (he had been Robert J. Walker’s law student), and above all the cause of the grand old whig party, all these now fully inspired him. And, as he stepped forward to begin his speech you could see not only the glory of the occasion, but the gaudia certami/nis, beam from his countenance. He made one of the most brilliant and memorable speeches of his life and took his seat amid deafening applause. Gen. Anderson, a democrat of the genuine Bourbon type, followed Prentiss. He was a superb platform speaker. He was equip- ped with every requisite for the orator; with the wit and ridicule of an O’Connell. the fund of anecdote, play of fancy and droll humor of a Corwin, all of which he could admirably use to give edge to the most trenchant logic, or point to the most vigorous argument. He seemed master of the situation, now turning argument, now ridicule, against the strong points of the whig speakers, till there appeared to be nothing left of them. Then again he would turn the tide of wit and humor against his opponents, keeping the audience convulsed with laughter, till everything they had heard from the whig orators was laughed away or forgotten. The plaudits of the crowd were showered upon him as he retired. This barbecue was a remarkable event in the campaign of ’40 in Mississippi. I questioned Mr. Hewitt as to his recollections of these speeches. He replied: “They were all excellent; each one unequalled of its kind and just such a speech as only such an orator could make. But that speech of Pren- tiss’, nobody could equal. It is as distinctly impressed on my mind to-day as excelling all the other speeches of that occasion. as Prentiss excelled all other orators of his time.”

24 ~ . REUNION ADDRESS A QUARTER OF A CENTURY OF TEACHING HISTORICAL ADDRESS DELIVERED BY A. D. P. VAN‘ BUREN, AT THE REUNION or DR. AND mas. J. A. B. s'roivn’s PUPILS, AT KALAMAZOO, SEPT. 23, 1885. Mr. Chairman.) Honored Teachers, Old Schoolmaitcs and Fellow Citizens: It is said that the true function of the historian is to keep the past alive for us. But how much of the past do we ﬁnd thus secured? Or rather 110w little does that reverend chronicler of the deeds of men tell us of the years that are gone. We get but a meager outline, a mere synopsis of the public acts of rulers, leading men, and remarkable events. All else, and often the bet part, is unrecorded. And as we recede from this unwritten past, time robes it in the mellow light of romance, or throws the glamour of enchantment over its achievements, which then pass into the age of chivalry, and are regarded as more beautiful and attractive than true. The nevelist and day-dreamer ﬁnd it delightful to enter this realm of the by-gone, “this lazy land where it seemeth always afternoon.” There is much of our school- day life of which we can say, as we do of the singing of Sontag or Lind, or of the acting of Booth or Garrick: “Well, this delightful thing has been, and all that is now.left of it is the feeble print upon my brain, the thrill which memory will send along my nerves; and as we live longer the print and thrill must be feebler, and when we pass away the impression will have passed from the world.” Consequently the most delightful part of our school-days, like the song of the bird, a strain of music. or the orator‘s elo- quence, cannot be written, it is only retained by the memory and the feelings. You will remember, fellow students, the beautiful line of Virgil that we used to quote so often and which tonight I can again quote as applying most ﬁttingly to the things that we did in our school days. forty years ago. “Forsan ct haec ol-i/m memim'sse juvabit,” perhaps it will delight thee to have remem- bered these things hereafter. True there is the old quotation. Our past, then. the history of the school we would give to-night. lies mostly
Page 25
MEMORY'S SCENES 25 in this unrecorded by-gone; for although the history of the Kalamazoo branch of the Michigan university, and of the schools of Dr. and Mrs. Stone succeed- ing it, have been written, yet how little of the real history of this quarter of a century of teaching, so invaluable, has been given. How little can be given. we can give but a mere outline of it this evening. Had I the wand of Prospero to wave over our past, and reproduce. or bring to light but one session of our school, in the golden days of the “old Branch,” what a delight- ful retrospect it would be to the teachers and students of that school here to-night. Memory is now busy with those past scenes. “My eyes make pictures when they are shut." I see the old Branch standing half hid ,among the trees on the corner of the park. I hear— “The old school bell's familiar sound Peal out among the oaks once more; Though I had heard it many a. time, It never rang so sweet before." We are all going to school again. We are once more sitting in our seats at early morning prayer. Again the class bell rings; our teacher sits in his arm chair on the platform, with text-book in hand; we are reciting our lessons. The varied school day routine goes on; students, who study in their rooms, drop in to recitation. It is a ﬁne day in June, the windows are up, “the air is balm and rosemary.” I hear the hum of the busy hive all at work. -“ Methinks I've cast full fort years aside. , And am at school again. ' he gentle breeze That trembles through the Windows bears" the fragrance of the clover blossoms, the song of birds from the trees, and the tinkle of “old crumple horn’s” bell from the park lot. Class after class come and go. I hear the light tripping of feet down the stairs, the door opens, a bevy of girls with text-books in hand come in to recite. Others hav- ing recited trip up stair to their seats again. I see their bright eyes and smiling faces. I hear passing words with each other as they go in and out. Thus fancy restores the whole scene till we are all once more at school. Fellow students, in thought the picture is real, and “Life is but thought, so think I will, That you and I are schoolmates still." The Branch building was a two-story frame structure. Dr. Stone had charge of the young men in the room on the ﬁrst ﬂoor; Mrs. Stone of the young ladies in the room above. There was but one government. All the difﬁcult or appeal cases in Mrs. Stone’s room were referred for settlement to 4

26 THE UNIVERSITY BRANCHES the principal. The curriculum was ample, including all those studies that would ﬁt a student for the university at Ann Arbor, or he could go through a part or the whole university course here if he chose. Most of the classes below were made up largely of young ladies who came down to recite, and young men sometimes formed part of the classes in Mrs. Stone’s room. There was also a small room on the second floor called “No. 3,” designed for the tutor’s department, which was usually rented by some of the advanced students, one of whom acted as tutor in hearing certain classes recite. Two or more students usually occupied “No. 3,” there being room for a bed in it. This was the room where the students held all their meetings and attended to all their club affairs, and at the close of the term, here is where they held their once famous jubilees, sung songs, responded to toasts, made speeches, and gave the parting hand. _ The Kalamazoo Branch had attracted and drawn together within its walls a large number of students from various parts of this state and from other states. The young men and young ladies whose names were enrolled as its students in the spring of 1843 would have done honor by their intellectual endowments to any academy in the land. The school itself was popular, the branch universities established in different parts of the state were near enough together to awaken in the minds of the people of the new state a desire for a higher education, and they were far enough apart to aﬁord each other a patronage sufficient to secure a large membership. It was not long before this branch, under the superior organizing power and able manage ment of Dr. Stone, became one of the best known and most popular in the state. _ I These branches were really young universities equipped with the curric- ulum that was to be used in the main school at Ann Arbor when that should be opened. In the meanwhile they pioneered and led the way up from the log school-house to the State University. They had, as the times demanded, played the pedagogue by instructing the young through the rudimentary branches, then played the professor through the preparatory degrees, and often through the full college course. So “that when the university, was ﬁnally declared ready to begin her work there were hosts of students all over the state ready to form and ﬁll up her classes from freshman to senior. Thus the university was ﬁtted for her work and set going. And as the branches closed their doors, and retired from their ﬁeld of labor, they could truthfully have said to the State University. “Your success is now more than half assured, go to work and secure the rest yourself.” It was in May. 1843, when Dr. J. A. B. Stone and his wife, Mrs. L. H. Stone, appeared on this scene of educational labor, where they continued to
Page 27
WORK OF DR. AND MRS. STONE 27 work uninterruptedly one quarter of a century. Both of them had had ex- perience in teaching, he in academies, in Mi'ddlebury College and in Newton Theological Seminary, while Mrs. Stone, besides her teaching in Vermont, had extended her experience to teaching in the south. After pecuniary aid in 1850 had been withdrawn from the Branch the building was used for the ladies’ college, which was then in process of erection. Dr. Stone, who had been so instrumental in building the upper college, was made its president. while Mrs. Stone, equally efficient in building the ladies’ college, became principal of that, which was dedicated in 1859. I Dr. and Mrs. Stone were the ﬁrst and successful advocates of a full collegi- late course for young women in our state. Being both unequalled as organ- izers and educators, nothing short of a complete education for both sexes would have satisﬁed them. In a historical sketch of Kalamazoo College, pre-' pared at the request of the trustees by the Rev. S. Haskell, the secretary of the board, we ﬁnd the following description of the work done by them in their connection with the college: “To Professor J. A. B. Stone fell the lot of following Button, and the short course of one is in contrast with the long course of the other. Dr. and Mrs. Stone commenced their labors in 1843, and they twain have been one ﬂesh and one spirit in these labors uninterruptedly until the present time. Their work has been multifor'm and multiplex. There is nothing which they have not touched, from the gravel beneath all material foundation stones to the ﬁnale of each pupil’ ediﬁcation in learning and character, their means the while spreading as ditfusely through the work as their labors have done. \Vith the entrance of the institution upon its full college career Dr. Stone was appointed its president. and has so continued through these nearly nine years, Mrs. Stone thoroughly occupying the position of principal of the female department.” I It may be said of Dr. and Mrs. Stone as regards their long career as teach- ers in the schools of Kalamazoo. that in their labor for their pupils both as to education and character, “they builded better then they knew.” The teacher who imparts a love of study to the pupil, has conferred an invaluable bequest; it is like giving him the “philosopher’s stone” that will enable him to turn his time and talent to the acquisition of the golden treasures of knowledge. This is worth all else that books and schools can give, for it leads to the making of the full scholar and the full man. We got this love of study from our teachers, and MORE, there was a power of character that did so underlie and enforce the work of the intellect—that did so arouse and energize their pupil, so call forth their strength and the pleasure of its exercise—as to make the hardest work agreeable.
Page 28
28 INFLUENCE OF THEIR TEACHINGS | The course of study pursued at the Branch, under the personal direction of Dr. and Mrs. Stone, was used as the means to develop the moral as well as the intellectual powers of the student. They were in fact, as well as in law, our teachers in loco paren-tis, for they not only taught but trained the stu- dents in their course day by day, ever impressing on their minds, till it be- came ingrained in their natures, that it was morals that gave the highest value to scholarship. The Kalamazoo Branch was our Rugby, and its prin- cipal was our Dr. Arnold, whose words seemed half deeds. and their presence in our thoughts was a potent moral force ever with us. “Our teacher absent was our teacher st ill." Wherever we went his instruction went with us as an inspirer to high thoughts and high deeds. Education, he would say, was valuable, culture was above education, character was above culture, and the christian sentiment gave the highest value to character. “The ﬁgure is in the stone and the sculptor only ﬁnds it.” The ﬁgure here was character, and it was the educational work of our teachers to develop that in its fullest perfection. The pupil saw that by following the instruction of the teacher it would not only make the most of his time and studies. but the most of him. By such training the general habits of the student were made to conform to those rules of educational and moral life that are essential to the develop- ment of the highest type of the scholar and the man. Moral and religious instruction was made valuable to us. not so much by direct teaching, or what we were brought to know. as from what we were brought to feel by the unconscious inﬂuence of the life and character of our teachers, and by the illustrious examples that were daily brought to our attention as models and guides for us in life. - Who shall attempt to estimate the good eﬂects of such teaching on the pupil, and through the pupil on the society in which he moves? What shall we say, then, of the hundreds of pupils who, from 1843 to 1868, have gone forth from the halls of learning presided over by Dr. and Mrs. Stone, to mingle in the atfairs of the world wherever their lot may have been cast? Who shall estimate the corrective inﬂuence of such lives upon society. or the beneﬁt they have conferred upon mankind? INCIDENTS If anything could “beguile the old Gray Beard of his pinionsf” or cause him to forget to turn his glass this evening, perhaps it would be the repro- duction of some of the incidents of the “old Branch days.” But alas, how many of them have

INCIDENTS 29 “Gone glimmering through the dream of th' that were, A school boy’s tale, the pride and Wonder 0 an hour." “'ednesday afternoon was declamation and composition day for the young men below, and composition day for the young ladies above. If they got through with their exercises ﬁrst, which they often did, they came below to hear us declaim. At one time a knot of young ladies had conspired to ﬂurry or disconcert the declaimer, and cause him to break down if they could. This was not general. They selected certain students whom they wished to vic- timize on such occasions. Consequently when one of these students was on the stage and heard the patter of feet hastening down stairs he knew that trouble was brewing for him. One day William,Eames had just taken the stage when the accustomed footfalls were heard on the stairs. Dr. Stone told him to wait till the young ladies were seated. I can see him now standing at ease, calmly waiting for the wave of Dr. Stone’s hand to begin. He was the Cicero of our declamation set. Graceful, humorous, eloquent or pathetic, there was a charm in his manner and delivery that always made it a pleasure to listen to him. Although there was something mischievous in the young ladies’ glances at Eames when they came in, yet it was doubtful whether they meant to attack him at that time. We sat anxiously waiting to hear what he had in store for us. And what do we hear: “Old Grimes is dead, that good old soul Whom we shall see no more," &c., &c. That was enough. Instantly a masked battery of eye-shots, grimaces and jeers was let loose on him for daring to declaim that old, antiquated ballad, that the very urchins in the streets h'ad repeated till it was worn to tatters. Of course this attack was made on the sly, when the teacher did not see them. But it was all useless, for Eames had struck the pathetic in the famous old ballad. and, despite all their efforts to confuse him, he turned upon his tor- mentors and rehearsed the plaintive story of old Grimes with such pathos and tenderness that the young ladies’ opposition was hushed and subdued into admiration of the declaimer. Eames left the stage triumphant. William Eames. one of the noblest of our school-mates, died in early manhood. -At another time Charles Beckwith, now judge of the supreme court of Buﬁalo, had just begun to declaim, when the door opened and the young ladies entered. He stopped till they were seated. They immediately, by look and gesture, attempted to disconcert him. But he was not to be flurried. Watching the opportunity when Dr. Stone was not looking at him, he turned towards them, and, putting his ﬁnger to his nose, deliberately made the John Tyler manipulation (then in full vogue) which said to them more deﬁantly

30 INCIDENTS than words could—“yon can’t come it!” Then going on with his declama- tion, acquitted himself so handsomely that he even won praise from these young ladies. There is another incident connected with our declamation days that is yet clearly impressd upon my memory. It is the case of Darius J. Davidson of Union City. He being now a Detroit lawyer it won’t hurt him if I tell it here. Davidon had failed every time he had attempted to declaim. He ﬁnally con- cluded that if the rule to declaim was imperative he would have to leave the - school. I advised him to try once more. He replied that it was simply impos- sible for him to get on that stage and “speak a piece” before the school. But after a long talk, he agreed to try again. He selected the ﬁrst part of the Declaration of Independence. He thought he wouldn’t fail on that, for he knew it by heart already. He had two weeks to practice on it, in the mean- ‘while, he declaimed it to me six or eight times without missing a word. His Wednesday came. I was his prompter, and took seat midway between the door and stage. Davidson’s name was called; he took the rostrum, made his bow and begun: “\Vhen, in the course of human events”—a pause; I prompt --“it.becomes necessary”—he repeats and pauses, I prompt—“for one people” —a pause; I repeat, and look up—Davidson was striding down the aisle past me, and as I looked back he shot out,of the door, and disappeared from sight. One of the students said to him that “he stalked out of the school room, like a perfect ‘Colossus of Rhodes.’ ” Davidson afterwards said that when he had uttered the ﬁrst ten words it began to grow dark before him and he knew nothing till he found himself out on the lawn standing bareheaded under a. burr oak tree. _ It is said that the critical period in the student’s school days is found in his Latin course. That the little god holds his court in the verbal realm “amo” (love), and that it is in this realm that the student ﬁrst meets his destiny. Consequently we have the adage—“Love and Latin do not work well together.” Charles Kingsley has thus described this period: “When all the world is young, my lad, And every tree is green, ‘ And every goose a swan, my lad, And every lass a ueen, Then his to boot an home, my lad, And round the world away, Young blood must have its course, my lad, An every dog his day. As said, the young student usually meets his fate in the word man. If he can conjugate that verb correctly through all its moods and tenses, and

THE MIRROR—ITS CONTRIBUTORS 31 pass unscathed the arrows of the little god. he is safe. Now I mention no names, and I refer to no student of the old Branch when I simply say that if the walls of some of their rooms could repeat the verb amo as they had heard it conjugated, it would be something like this: “Amo, amas, I love a lass As cedar tall and slender; Sweet oowslip's grace Is her nominative case, And she's of the feminine gender." “'e would know then, I say, in what student’s room the little god had held sway. . The students sustained a debating society. This was in fact a continuation of the old “Burr Oak Club” which had been the arena where the older citi- zens had discussed the mooted questions of their day. Many of the students received great beneﬁt from this club. Sometimes the citizens would come and discuss a question with us. A paper called the Mirror was edited by two of the students, who were elected as its editors. The Mirror was very popular, and among its numerous contributors were some able writers. It was “published” every Wednesday afternoon when the elocutionary exercises were over. Charles Beckwith and the writer of this address were the editors for 1845. I remember that, at the close of our editorial year, we divided the manuscript articles of the corre- spondents, be taking a portion, I the rest. Among my collection of these papers I lately found a package written in the years 1843, ’44 and ’45. The handwriting of many of them was familiar to me, and through the mask of a ﬁctitious name signed at the bottom, I could read the name of some old classmate of forty years ago. As I looked over these contributions to the old Mirror, they seemed to “shed the light of other days around me.” What thoughts and emotions crowded upon me as I recognized in these “noms de plu/me” the names of Edwin C. Hinsdill, Wyllis C. Ransom, Charles Beck- with; of James A. Duncan and Wells R. Marsh, both of whom died in full manhood, when there was the promise of a brighter future before them. And here was the name of Dwight May, distinguished as student, lawyer and for the high positions of trust he has held in this state, and whose death a few years ago we all mourned. Here were the names of Elias Cooley, Myron Hinsdill, Gibson Brown, and here I ﬁnd “Justitia”-—George A. Hinsdill, the Byron of our school'—splendid fellow, with an intellect that a prince might envy, the ﬁne things in whose conversation were always worth noting down. After having risen to prominence in the profession of law in the
Page 32
32 CLOSING REFLECTIONS west, he died when his usefulness was most needed in the tipbuilding of a new state. The names of George Trask, John Goodrich and George Fitch bring vividly to mind three old school mates who have “gone to the other side.” They made their mark, the ﬁrst two as business men, the latter as editor and newspaper manager. And here, under the noms de plume of some of the fair correspondents of the Mirror, I read the names of Minerva Cornell, Car- oline M. Swayzee, Eliza A. Hays, Genevieve Hinsdill, Cornelia A. Clark, Refella Brown, Zilpha Foote, and others of our old schoolmates. We hope during this reunion to read you some of these contributions to the Mirror. And now I must close. This is aremarkable gathering—one never to be forgotten. When we older students, now gray-headed men and women, entered the Branch, the younger class at this reunion were not born. Some of the younger students here are children of the older-ones, and some are pupils of the older students; thus Dr. and Mrs. Stone have taught several generations of pupils here in Kalamazoo. And here in this assemblage of their pupils we ﬁnd the three periods of life, youth, manhood and age, rep- resented. Holmes has said: “Youth longs, manhood strives, and age remembers.” The oldest students here to-night have passed through the ardent, ambitious period of youth when the great desire was to get an educa- tion; and they have entered the arena where “manhood strives,” and there they have found whatever of success they have achieved in life has been mostly due to the valuable instruction and thorough training they have received as pupils of these honored teachers. And now they have reached the period where “age remembers.” We remember that we were taught to aim high in life—“to shoot an arrow at the sun every morning.” That the habit of getting good lessons, of always trying to do our best, once estab- lished, would lead on to fortune. Yes, old schoolmates, memory is busy tonight with our school days. We can read on its tablets the history of that happy period. “History,” says Shelley, “is the cyclic poem written by time on the memories of men.” Would that I could gather from the memory of each student here at this reunion the brightest and best recollections of his or her own school days; I would transcribe them all into one beautiful poem and present it, in their behalf, as a souvenir to our dear teachers on this happy occasion.

COMPARATIVE VALUATIONS 33 HISTORY OF THE FREEWILL BAPTIST CHURCH OF ooox’s PRAIRIE ' BY HON. JOHN C. PATTERSON [Read at the Semi-Centennial Anniversary of the Church, March 12, 1886.] It is ﬁtting for us today, on the ﬁftieth anniversary of the organization of this church, to recall in memory those pioneers who planted this vine in the wilderness, to take account of the fruit it has borne and of its present fruit- fulness, and to estimate the possible Cruitage of the future. This church and society to-night possess the accumulations of the half century, and are en- joying privileges which were secured long before the present generation was born. As we convene in this cozy chapel and occupy these cushioned pews. surrounded by these broad, cultivated ﬁelds and beautiful homes of luxury, we cannot properly appreciate the comforts and privileges we enjoy without looking back, through the clouds and sunshine of fifty years, to the rude place of worship, the narrow ﬁelds and the plain homes of the fathers and mothers who gave this church existence. Let us go back in imagination to March 12, 1836, and glance at Cook’s Prairie as the founders of this church saw it when they convened to take upon themselves that solemn covenant with all its obligations. ,We ﬁnd our- selves in the territory of Michigan, with a population of about one hundred thousand. Our commonwealth has not yet been admitted into the national union as a state. We are in the township of Homer, which at that time comprised all the territory now contained in the townships of Homer, Clar- endon, Eckford and Albion, and the greater part of the territory of the city of Albion. The equalized valuation of the township of Homer as thus con- stituted in 1836, was $146,250.00, equal to about one-half of the property now owned by the members of this church and society. The equalized valuation of this same territory, in 1885. was $4,961,687.00. In the fall of 1836, the sum of $336.94 taxes was apportioned to the township of 5

34 ORGANIZATION OF EARLY CHURCHES Eckford. In 1885 the sum of $4,117.43 of the state and county taxes was assigned to Eckford. In 1836, $740.57 of taxes wereapportioned to the townships of Homer, Clarendon and Albion, and in 1885, $17,967.39 were assigned to the same territory. Fifty years ago the combined wealth of all the members of this church and society did not exceed 86,000.00; to- day it exceeds $300,000.00. This church organized on the twelfth day of March, 1836. The town- ~ ship of Eekford was set off from the township of Homer and organized as a separate township by an act of the territorial legislature on the twenty-third day of March. 1836; the township of Albion, by an act of the state legisla- ture on the eleventh day of March, 1837, and the township of Clarendon on the sixth day of March, 1838. In March, 1830. there were not three hundred acres of land improved within miles of this spot, and today there is scarcely~ an acre of unimproved land, unless reserved for timber, for 'miles away. There were only three small frame houses on the prairie at that time. The pioneer log cabin, with parlor, sitting-room. dining-room, kitchen and bed- room all combined, was the prevailing style. The village of Homer, or “Barneyville,” and the city of Albion, or “The Forks,” were only prospec- tive municipalities. and not actually _'populated. But few public highways were laid out and opened. The marshes, creeks and rivers were crossed on old beaver dams, or forded. The cross-ways and bridges were yet unbuilt. The clearings and fences were few and the trails and pathways ran in various directions across the broad commons. as suited the convenience or pleasure ' of the traveler. The primitive burr oak trees were standing here and there like the remnants of an old orchard. There was no undergrowth of timber, save here and there a thrifty clump of hazel bushes. -The ground was sodded with the strong roots of the prairie grass, which in summer grew two or three feet in height and waved in the winds like a heavy growth of golden grain. IVild deer were as common on these plains then a sheep are now. Wild ’ turkeys and prairie chickens were more numerous than the domestic fowls are now. No locomotive‘s shrill whistle was heard at night and no rumbling cars by day. The silence of the nightand the peaceful slumbers of the hopeful pioneer were often disturbed by the hideous how] of the prowling wolf, but each dawn of day was heralded by a grand chorus of wild bird song. _It was before the age of railroads. telegraphs and telephones. In March, 1836, there was but one religious organization in this vicinity. On the fourteenth day of December, 1835 (less than three month before) the First Congregational church of Homer was organized by the Rev. Calvin Clark at the residence of Deacon Henry Cook. Henry Cook and Medad ' Bordwell were among the trustees then elected. This organization seems to

EARLY SETTLERS _ 35 have been soon after abandoned. The same persons were among the number who organized the Presbyterian church of Homer on the thirteenth day of September, 1837. The Methodist Episcopal church of Homer was organized- on the ﬁfteenth day of April, 1839. I ,It will be seen from these dates that the Prairie church is the oldest religious organization in this part of the county- The ﬁrst Freewill Baptist, church planted in the territory of Michigan was formed near Ypsilanti, March 14, 1831, ﬁve years before this church was formed. Other Freewill Baptist churches have been established in the territory before this, but so far as I have been able to learn all of these older churches have ceased to exist, and today Cook’s Prairie church is the oldest Freewill Baptist church in the state. THE FOUXDERS ’ i ; tj The pioneers of Cook’s Prairie and vicinity came from New York and New England. In their new homes they missed the church privileges and the' religious teachings of the east, and with Puritanic zeal set about building: new altars of worship. Among the ﬁrst settlers on the prairie were Elder: Samuel Whitcomb, a native of New Hampshire, and Elijah Cook, Jr. a native of New York. They came into the territory together from western New York in 1834, and purchased adjoining farms. Elder Whitcomb pur- chased the farm now occupied by Erastus Stead, and Mr. Cook the farm where he afterwards lived and died, and which is now owned by Francis Andrews. They made their purchases and returning to New York, made preparations for moving their families to their new homes. Mr. Cook deter- mined to purchase more land, and on the twenty ﬁrst day of January, 1835, accompanied by his son-in-law and daughter, Daniel Dunakin and Eliza Ann Dunakin and Eli T. Chase, he started from Clarkston, Monroe county, New York, for Cook’s Prairie, by private wagon conveyance, of the prairie schooner type, and after a journey of twenty-two days in mid-winter, arrived ' at their destination on the twelfth day of February, 1835. Messrs. Dunakin and Chase were young men, just past their majority, and came to make a home in the west. Mr. Dunakin purchased the farm where he so long lived and where he died, now owned by his son-in-law, Edwin L. Owen. Mr. Chase bought eighty acres of the farm where he now resides. After paying one hundred dollars, the government price for the land, he had three dollars left, a surplus capital. with which to make improvements. His means in hands is a fair sample of the accumulated wealth at that time of many of the early members of this church and society. But improvements and a home were in due time made. In 1837 Mr. Chase married Margaret, the only daughter of Elder Samuel Whitcomb. Mr. Cook, after transacting his busi-
Page 36
36 insconn or THE CHURCH ness, went back to New York, returning in the spring with his family. and accompanied by Lionell Udell and family. In August, 1835, Elder Whit- comb moved his family from Alabama, Genesee county, New York, and settled on his farm. Jacob Rosecrantz, a native of Pennsylvania. came from Orleans county, New York, and settled on the farm now owned by the estate of Perry Herrington, in January, 1836. The same year John Blake, a native of Maine, came from Clarendon, New York, and settled on the farm, where he afterwards lived and died, which is now owned by B. F. Witherbee. Elder Whitcomb had been a minister in the Freewill Baptist denomination some years. Soon after his arrival he began preaching in the red school- house then standing about ﬁve-eights of a mile south of this chapel and nearly opposite the present residence of Albert Andrus. The school-house was small, but with its two rows of seats behind the two rows of high desks around three sides of the room it accommodated all the worshipers. A num- ber of Christian men and women were among the hearers, and a small con- gregation was gathered. It was determined to organize a Freewill Baptist church, and on that March afternoon, just ﬁfty years ago today, a meeting was called at the school-house for that purpose. Let the record of that meeting as recorded at the time in the bold hand-writing of Elijah Cook, J r., relate its own history: RECORD or THE FIRST FREEWILL BAPTIST CHURCH IN now—m, CALHOUN COUNTY, MICHIGAN TER- RITORY. Homer, March 12, 1836'. A meeting of brethren and sisters assembled to associate andconfer on the subject of entering into church covenant with God and with each other. The meeting was opened with singing and prayer by Elder Samuel Whitcomb. 1st. Appointed Elder Samuel Whitcomb to the chair. 2d. Appointed Bro. Elijah Cook, Jr., secretary pro tem. 3d. Voice of the assembly was in favor of forming a church. 4th. Read the Freewill Baptist treatise on their faith. 5th. Moved and carried by twelve brethren and sisters that it is their duty and privilege to enter into church covenant together. 6th. Read a covenant from Colby's Journal and unanimously agreed to receive the same as theirs. 7th. Received and read the letters of command from the different churches for embodying. The church covenant read and which was taken by this little band of Christians in the wilderness was as follows: “We are agreed in repairing to the Scriptures of truth as our only and all-sufﬁcient rule of faith and practice, believing that there is no man wise enough to revise the laws of Christ or to alter them for the better. Neither do we consider ourselves or any other society perfect in a strict sense so but that we are liable to errors and imperfection, and of course if any man or men ﬁx a book of discipline to govern the church by, it must be an imperfect one. The Lord Jesus
Page 37
I CHARTER MEMBERS 37 Christ has given us a perfect law of liberty and we are not willing to exchange a. perfect law for an imperfect one. We therefore consider that the Scriptures are sufﬁcient for the church to make their appeal to on any and every occasion, for saith Paul to Timothy. ‘All Scripture is given by inspiration of God and is proﬁtable for doctrine, for reproof. for correction, for in- struction in righteousness; that the man of God may be perfect, thoroughly furnished unto all good wmks.’ If, therefore, we are thoroughly furnished, we need nothing more than to con- Sider the Scriptures of truth as our only and all-sufﬁcient rule of faith and practice, hoping and praying that we shall all be led by the same spirit by which they were written. Therefore, under these considerations, we not only consider it our duty but esteem it our privilege to be em- bodied together as a. church, and having ﬁrst given ourselves to God, we now give ourselves to one another by the will of God to watch over each other for good, and to build each other up in the most holy faith, to bear one another‘s burdens, and so fulﬁll the law of Christ. And now. as brethren and sisters in Christ, as children of one family, and heirs of the grace of God, we cove- nant, unite and agree to stand by each other and do all we can to strengthen and encourage each other on our heavenly journey; and also to preserve a union and harmony in the church by attending to the worship of God and all the ordinances of His house. And may the Lord grant us grace and wisdom that we may shine as a light in the world and that this church be as a city set on a bill that cannot be hid. Therefore, as an evidence of our thus uniting as above men— tioned, we give orders to the clerk to enroll our names together." Daniel Dunakin, Eliza Ann Dunakin, Eli T. Chase and Catharine Cook were received upon letters from the Freewill Baptist church of Clarkston, N. Y. ; Solomon Russell, by letter from the Freewill Baptist church of Elba, N. Y.; Jonas Cutler and Janet Cutler, upon letter from the Freewill Bap- tist church of Alabama, N. Y., and Samuel Whitcomb, Jacob Rosecrantz, Clarissa Rosecrantz, Melissa Haskell, John Blake and Elijah Cook. Jr., were received upon verbal expression. The right hand of fellowship was given by Elder Whitcomb. should be held once in four weeks, and that the name of the church should be The First Freewill Baptist Church of Homer, Michigan Territory. The name was changed April 24, 1841. and The First Freewill Baptist Church of Cook’s Prairie was adopted as the name of the ecclesiastical organization. Of the thirteen persons who became charter members of this church ﬁfty years ago, only one. Eli T. Chase, the chairman of your committee on this anniversary, survives. Soon after the organization Simeon Cowles, Sarah Cowles and Lucinda Blake united with the church. July'23d the names of Harriet Watkins and Harriet Townsend were added; September 9th Stephen H. Wilson united and October 9th Mandanna Udell became a member; November 15th the names of Henry R. Cook and Lewis Whitcomb were added to the church roll and on the 3d of December, 1836, Chester Smith and Abigail Smith became It was determined by vote that their covenant meetings 71956

Of this number Martha Blake and Henry R. Cook are with us tonight; Lewis Whitcomb resides in Washington territory; the rest have passed over to their ﬁnal reward. It is not the purpose of this paper to name the members. but simply to mention those who organized the church and those who united during the ﬁrst year of its existence. The latter can justly be classed among the found- ers of the enterprise. . Solomon Rusell took a letter from the church January 9. 1838, and Jonas Cutler, Janet Cutler, Harriet Watkins and Harriet Townsend took let- ' ters in November, 1838, to join the Concord church. At the same time Stephen H. Wilson and wife were dismissed by letter. Melissa Haskell, the wife of Timothy Haskell, of South Albion, took a letter in 1841, to unite with the Bellevue church. Sarah Cowles took a letter in March, 1841, to unite with the Battle Creek church. Four of the charter members and four of the early members thus withdrew from the church in its infancy. Simeon Cowles died in 1839, and Mandanna Udell died in April, 1842. BRANCHES The church worshiped in the old red school-house, where it was organized, until the brick chool-house opposite the prewnt church ediﬁce was built. The services were held in the new school-house until this church was completed in 1860. Under the leadership of Elders Whitcomb and Cook, this church was instrumental in organizing Freewill Baptist interests in other. localities. In 1841 Elder Whitcomb organized a church in Burlington, and a dozen or more churches were organized within a radius of forty miles by Elders Whitcomb and Cook, prior to 1846. A' branch of this church was formed at the house of David Cummings, in Clarendon, on the 18th of July, 1842, with power to transact local business. David Powers, Horace B. Hayes. Rufus Sarz, Lovina Sarz, Abram Vreeland, Thomas Clark, Issac Vreeland, Fanny Vreeland and '1‘. Deming were received as members of this auxiliary society. This branch remained visible but a short time. Some of the members afterwards became identiﬁed with the mother church. On the 23d day of March, 1846. the Freewill Baptist Church of Eckford was organized at the Olive school-house by Elders Samuel “'hitcomb and H. S. Limbocker. Twelve members, viz., Daniel Dunakin, Eliza Ann Dunakin, Eli T. Chase, Charles Olin, Cynthia Olin, John Whitcomb, Nancy Whit- comb, Sarah Cowles, Augustus Lusk, Ann Lusk, William Markham and Louisa J. Hawkins united as the charter members. Eight of the number

INCORPORATION 39 were members of this church and seem never to have severed their connection. The Eckford church had a visible existence until October, 1851, and enrolled thirty-seven members. The same pastors divided their labors between the two churches. When the Eckt'ord church ceased to exist, by common con- sent of the members of that, and by the votes of this church in 1.153, the records of the two churches were consolidated and the active members were transferred to this organization. Although the Eckford church had an inde- pendent organization for a time. it seems to have performed the functions and in fact to have been a branch of this. church. INCORPORATION The society, in the pioneer days, possessed no church, no communion set, and no church property. The deacous took care of the baptismal robes, and the librarian of the Sunday school carried his library in a basket. A legal board of trustees to manage the temporalities of the church was unnecessary. In May, 1858, it was determined to build a place of worship, and the plan of this chapel was substantially adopted. To acquire the authority to hold prop- erty under the laws of the state, a religious corporation then became a nec- essity. Articles of association for that purpose were signed on the 9th day of May, 1859. by Franklin Mead, E. H. Cook, Elijah Cook, H. R. Cook, J. L. Cook, E. T. Chase, Alfred Stiles, Wm. Beedon, Cyrus Heath, F. P. Auger, Caleb McComber, T. O. Dunton, L. Richey, E. Andrus, Green Wells, H. B. Richey, A. Mumbrne, David Patterson, John Blake, H. B. Hayes, A. C. Hop- kins, Luther Rogers, Bela F. Putnam, Wm. McNitt, Joseph E. Daniels, Wm. Rosecrantz, S. Underwood, Lafayette Andrus, Wm. Putnam, Joshua Henshaw and Mark Humphrey. The ﬁrst meeting to elect trustees was held April 26th, 1859. The pastor of the church, Rev. F. P. Auger, was elected chairman and Henry R. Cook clerk. 1']. H. Cook. who was elected trustee for three years. Franklin Mead for two years and Eli T. Chase for one year, constituted the ﬁrst board of trustees. Deacons John Blake and Joseph E. Daniels were the inspectors of this election and executed the ~certificate required by the statutes, which was ﬁled and recorded in the county clerk’s office on the 30th day of April, 1859. The incorporation of the society was thereby completed under the corporate name of “The Freewill Baptist Society of Cook‘s Prairie.” Henry R. Cook has held the ofﬁce of clerk-of the society for twenty-seven years continuously—from the incorporation to the present time. Eli T. Chase was reelected trustee for ﬁve successive terms and has held the ofﬁce for sixteen consecutive years—the longest continuous service of any one. E. 'H. Cook was trustee for twelve years in succession. Franklin Mead was trustee for eight years, was out of ofﬁce two years and then served on the

Hopkins have each served three years; L. J. Andrus, nine years; Horace B. Hayes, eight years; Albert Andrus, six years; William Ashley, three years and Theodore Cook ﬁve years. Few moneyed corporations have exercised their franchises as strictly and kept their records as accurately as this religious cor- poration. The proceedings and records of this society can be safely followed as precedents. They reﬂect great credit upon the clerk and trustees who have transacted the business. Elder Elijah Cook donated this church site to the society by an absolute conveyance, executed by himself and wife, on the 27th day of April, 1859. . \ CHURCH BUILDINGS The plan of the church as proposed by Mark Humphrey, architect and builder, in 1858, was adopted. The frame was raised on the ﬁrst day of July, 1859. The ladies of the society served dinner on the grounds. The building was completed at a cost of about $2,200 and was dedicated in August, 1860. President Edmund B. Fairﬁeld. D. D., of Hillsdale College, preached the sermon on the occasion. The chapel has been slightly remodeled since it was ﬁrst erected, and in 1877 the sheds were built. PA STOR S Elder Samuel Whitcomb was pastor of the church from its organization until 1841, but was absent for some months on different occasions during the time. Elder H. S. Limbocker labored-with the church as an evangelist and as supply on one or more of these occasions. Sometimes services were held once in four weeks and sometimes once in two weeks. The ministers received from twenty-ﬁve to one hundred and seventy-ﬁve dollars a year as salary, and were compelled to work on their farms during the week to support their fam- ilies and to prepare their sermons while following the plow. Elder E. Hall was pastor from 1840 to 1841. Elder Limbocker became pastor in 1842. I am unable to ascertain how long he remained. It is probable that there was no regular pastor of the church a portion of the time until 1847. Elder Cyrus Coltren preached in 1847 and 1848. Professor Horace Wellington was pastor in 1849 and 1850. Rev. Edmund B. Fail-ﬁeld, D. D., ministered to the church for a time in 1851 and 1852. 'Elder Schuyler Aldrich was pas- tor from 1852 to 1855. Elder Elijah Cook supplied the pulpit in 1856 and at various other times. Rev. Ranson Dunn, D. D., preached as a supply on various‘occasions. In 1857 Elder F. P. Auger became pastor and remained . three years. He was an able preacher and a good business manager. Under
Page 41
CHURCH SERVICES ’ 41 his leadership a new-departure was taken and the Sunday school, church and society 'were conducted upon business principles. The means were raised and this church ediﬁce was erected under his ministrations. Elder O. D. Auger,‘ a brother of Elder F. P. Auger, was pastor from 1860 to April 7, 1861. Elder John Ashley was pastor from 1861 to 1867, Elder Geo. R. Holt was pastor from 1867 to 1870, Elder A. W. Ensign was pastor from 1870 to 1872. Elder A. J. Marshall was pastor from 1872 to 1873, Prof. J. S. Copp was pastor from 1873 to 1876, Elder G. S. Chappel was pastor from 1876 'to 1877, Elder John Ashley was pastor from 1877 to 1881 and Elder F R. Ran- dall was pastor from 1881 to the present time. In those early days when from poverty or other causes the church had no regular pastor, the members met regularly in their covenant and social meetings and kept the organiza- tion together. President E. B. Fairﬁeld. Prof. D. M. Graham and Prof. H. E. Whipple havepccupied the pulpit for short periods. Elder Wm. H. Osborn was pastor of the Eckford church for some time. Elders Whitcomb and Limbocker and Professors Wellington and Graham also ministered to the Eckford church at various times as pastor or supply. The ﬁrst twenty years of the church history may be classiﬁed as the pioneer period. The people were pioneers, they had pioneer preaching and pioneer singing. The jaded farm horses before a lumber wagon constituted the most stylish turnout seen going to church. I have seen whole families drive up to the old schoolhouse in lumber wagons, drawn by oxen. Calico dresses and coarse shoes had not been deprived of church privileges and excluded from the house of God. The fathers and mothers did not ride so fast on the road to church as do their children and grand-children today, but they started early and were quite as prompt. They put in a full day’s worship each Sunday. N0 twenty minute sermons were delivered. The morning sermon (as near as I can now time its length) was about two hours long, after _ which was an intermission of about half an hour, when the lunch basket was passed around; then came Sunday school and after Sunday school another short sermon, then all returned to their homes, conscious of having given good time. at least. in their worship. They had no organ. no church choir, but the congregation. when led by the enthusiastic voice of Elder Elijah Cook, never failed to sing “with the spirit and understanding.” Many of us can recall the thrilling eloquence and the impressive power of Elder Whitcomb as he gave expression to his agonizing petitions, to his overﬂowing gratitude and sublime adoration. in prayer. We can also recall the inpiring power and religious fervor of Elder Cook in social meetings in the exercise of his rare gift of song. 6

42 MEMBERSHIP—CAUSE OF RELIGION DEACONS Cornelius Putnam, Charles Smith, Charles Olin, Ira J. Wilkins, Horace B- Hayes, John Blake, Joseph C. Daniels, Elisha H. Cook, Lafayette J. Andrus, Theodore Cook and H. H. Sheers have held the oﬂice of deacons in thisv church, and Daniel Dunakin was chosen in the Eckford church. MINISTERS LICENSED AND ORDAINED ‘Twelve members of this chm'ch and its branches have been licensed to preach, and ordained to the christian ministry on the recommendation of this church, during its existence, whose names are as follows: Stephen H. Wilson, E. Hall, David Powers, Elijah Cook, Jr., Lewis J. Whitcomb, Walter H. Watkins, Stephen Mead, William'H. Osborn, George R. Holt, Henry B- Richey, Ennis Maynard, and J. D. McColl, D. M. Graham, and Horace Wellington. were ordained on the recommendation of this church. Walter H. Watkins and Wm. H. Osborn were members of the Eckford church or branch. MEMBERSHIP This church has been the spiritual home of nearly ﬁve hundred members ;. during the half century nearly ﬁve hundred persons have taken that solemn covenant just read. This ﬂock has had its sunshine and its shadow, its pros- perity and its adversity. It ha had its joys, its revival and time of spiritual: growth, and its sorrows, its indifference and times of spiritual decline. Yet in the light of the years, it seems to have had more of sunshine than of' shadow, more of prosperity than of adversity. It has been a power for good‘ in this community, in the denomination and states Whether this church has been “as a city set on a hill that cannot be hid,” as was devoutly prayed by its founders in that christian covenant taken by them ﬁfty years ago, can only. judged by its works. Has this organization, through its members. done anything for the cause of religion, christian education, human freedom,' and for gospel missions? Has it fulﬁlled its mission? By its fruits shall it be judged. CAUSE OF RELIGION Who can outline the religious influence of this church? Who-can describe the spiritual inﬂuence of any active christian church, of the impulses of morality and piety, of the assurances of faith and of the hopes of immortality and of heaven, there inspired? We can only gather a few leaves from the wayside and breathe the incense as it arises from the altar. We may note the
Page 43
CAUSE OF EDUCATION 43 good deeds of charity and feel the general inﬂuence of brotherly love; but we cannot on earth reach the choicest fruits of a christian church; the golden fruitage can only be gathered in heaven. The pastors of this church have been earnest and devoted men. They have preached the gospel from the Book itself. They have quoted poetry, not from Shakespeare and the mod- ern poets, but fﬂom the Psalms and Isaiah. They have quoted authority, not so much from Tyndall, Huxley and Darwin as from the sermon on the Mount; from John and St. Paul. A number of powerful revivals have been had and lasting religious impressions have here been made. No one can question but what this church has exerted a. great inﬂuence upon the morality of this.community. An enthusiastic Sabbath school has been con- tinually maintained for nearly two score years, in which the old and the young have been interested students of the Bible. This Sabbath school has been in fact, the nursery of the church. A majority of the members of the church, at the present time, were ﬁrst members of the Sabbath school. EDUCATIONAL CAUSE To appreciate the important part performed by the members of this church ' in the educational movement, we must go back ﬁfty years in the history of our state and of the Freewill Baptist denomination and consider the standard of public sentiment upon the question as it then existed. The common- wealth of Michigan wa then in its infancy. The people had not then had the inﬂuence of a graded school in every village and city. They had not lived beneath the light of our great university, nor had the beneﬁts of our numerous denominational colleges. Neither pastor nor people had enjoyed} the educational advantages which they now possess. There was no college in the Freewill Baptist denomination and its oldest seminary had then been in existence only four years. The ﬁrst Freewill Baptist church was organized by Benjamin Randall on the 30th day of June, 1780, and the denomination thus founded was not ﬁfty-six years old when 'this church was organized. The ministers were mostly uneducated men. Says a denominational his- torian: “Prejudice against an educated ministry and education for the ministry predominated during the ﬁrst sixty years of the denominational existence, and for a long time previous to 1840 the denomination had been losing from its ranks many ministers of piety and promise on account of its position ~on the question of education.” Elder David Marks tells us that when he determined to acquire an education he was accustomed to hide his grammar from his ministerial brethren to avoid their expressions of disap- proval. It is but just to say that this sentiment was not conﬁned to the Freewill Baptist denomination, but that it was common with many other
Page 44
44 CAUSE OF EDUCATION religious sects and was a result of the limited educational advantages of the day. Our present public school system has since revolutionized this condition of affairs in the state and our numerous denominational schools have worked a change in the church. Prior to 1840 the subject of education had been dis- cussed in denominational circles in New England. and on the 15th day of. January, 1840, the Freewill Baptist Educational Society was organized at Acton, Maine, “to provide means for the intellectual and moral improve- ment of young ministers.” This indicates the educational status in the east. The denomination, comparatively speaking, had no schools for higher educa- tion and but very few educated members and ministers. Strange as it may seem to us, the question of an educated ministry and the educational move ment were subjects of excited discussion and were opposed with the greatest ’ earnestness in denominational circles. Elder Samuel Whitcomb, the organizer and ﬁrst pastor of this church, Was the earliest advocate and the leading champion of an educated ministry and of the educational movement as a part of the denominational polity in Michigan. He had the sagacity to foresee that the church'ot' the future would require an educated ministry. As a means to that end, we ﬁnd him, soon after this church was established, advocating with his accutomed‘zeal, the establishment of a denominational school in the state. Elijah Cook, Jr.. who began preaching soon after, heartily endorsed this policy and pushed the . measure with all his stalwart power. During these early years Elders Whit- comb and Cook preached and organized churches in Calhoun. Branch. Jack- son, Eaton and Barry counties. They advocated the necessity of an educated ministry in their pulpits and agitated the question of a denominational school in the state. Wherever these evangelists labored the educational movement, so called, in the denomination, was brought before the people, and their churches were pushed to the front, far in advance of the other churches in the state. Among the prominent laymen in the denomination who took a leading position at that early day in the educational movement, I am able to mention Daniel Dunakin and Eli T. Chase, of this church, Heman Cowles and Thomas. Dunton of Battle Creek, Joseph S. Blaisdell of Assyria, Joseph C. Bailey and Jonathan Videto of Spring Arbor, and Rosevelt Davis of Blackman. Elder H. S. Limbocker, one of the early pastors of this church, was also one of the pioneer leaders in this movement. At' that time the mem- bers of the denomination were few in numbers, widely scattered and poor in purse. The yearly meeting, ﬁrst organized in the state at Leoni in 1839, contained only four hundred and sixty communicants. The agitation of the educational cause prior to 1844 had been principally carried on, as it had been begun, by Elders Whitcomb. Cook and Limbocker, and it had been
Page 45
ORGANIZED ACTION 45 mostly conﬁned to communicants in Calhoun and in adjoining counties where they had preached. These old fathers, though uneducated themselves and identiﬁed with an uneducated denomination and living in an uneducated age, recognized education as the handmaid of religion and preached this truth to their congregations. The ways and means, the plans and possibilities for a. denominational school were for years the subject of conversation between Elders Whitcomb and Cook as they met in neighborly intercourse. While Isaac E. Crary and John D. Pierce at Marshall. in the province of statesman- ship were discussing and perfecting the plan of our state public school system, laying its foundation broad and deep to be crowned by our great university. Samuel Whitcomb and Elijah Cook, Jr., here on Cook’s prairie, in the domain of church polity, were discussing and perfecting the plan and laying its foundations broad and deep for a denominational school in the state, to be crowned by Hillsdale college. ORGANIZED ACTION The denominational yearly meeting was to convene for its fourth annual conference at Franklin. Lenawee county, in June, 1844. The Calhoun quarterly meeting at that time contained the churches situated in Calhoun and adjoining counties. The delegates from this quarterly meeting to the yearly meeting were appointed some weeks before the yearly meeting was to convene. Samuel Whitcomb and Elijah Cook, Jr., from this church, Heman Cowles and Thomas Dunton. from Battle Creek, and Joseph S. Blaisdell. of Assyria, were the delegates appointed. They all favored the educational movement. and after their appointment conferred together and determined to bring the subject of a denominational school before the yearly meeting for action. Elder David Marks was at that time the most prominent leader in the educational movement and- was high authority in the denomination. After preaching for twenty years with zeal. power and success he was then pursuing a regular course of study at Oberlin College. Elder Cook wrote a letter to Elder Marks informing him of the measure proposed to be brought before this yearly meeting and urged him to be present to advocate the cause. Elder Marks was prevented from being present by sickness, but, he wrote Elder Cook a letter,'which was read to the conference, approving the proposed action. The yearly meeting convened at Franklin in June, 1844. Lewis J. Thomp- son delivered an address before the conference on christian education. Elder Whitcomb.. early in the business session of the conference, made a motion to raise ten thousand dollars to establish a denominational school within the limits of the yearly meeting. Rosevelt Davis seconded the motion and it was I

It was a new measure to the great majority of the delegates and they were not prepared to grapple with the question and assume the ﬁnancial burden. The motion was advocated by Elders Whitcomb, Cook and others. The approval of the measure by Elder David Marks, with the magic power of his name, was marshaled in its support. The motion trembled in the balance and seemed doomed to be lost. Laurens B. Potter (now Elder Potter of Lansing), be- lieving that the measure would be lost, unless modiﬁed in some way. drafted :a resolution to establish a denominational school in the state and to call a convention of the churches at Jackson to perfect the plan and to carry the resolution into effect. and offered it as a substitute. The vote was taken on this resolution, Samuel Whitcomb, Elijah Cook, Jr., Heman Cowles, Thomas Dun- ton, and Joseph S. Blaisdell, the ﬁve delegates from the Calhoun quarterly meeting, voted in favor of the measure; the rest of the conference were silent .and did not vote. Do we fully realize the importance of this vote? The vote of these ﬁve men on this measure, originally introduced by Samuel Whitcomb, gave to the denomination, to the state and to the world, Hillsdale college. The convention provided for in this resolution convened at Jackson in July or August, 1844, and appointed Cyrus Coltren (who was afterwards pastor of this church two years) agent to procure subscriptions, and deter- mined to locate the chool where the most contributions for the enterprise should be raised, having due regard for the healthfulness of the locality. Cook’s Prairie competed with Leoni, Jackson, and Spring Arbor for the school. Elder Cook tried to procure from Deacon Henry Cook the high grounds in the center of the‘prairie, now occupied by the buildings of Theodore Cook for a site. Spring Arbor raised the largest subscription and secured the prize. This community, headed by the generous subscriptions of Elijah Cook, Jr., Daniel Dunakin, Eli T. Chase and others contributed liberally to the enterprise. we must remember that a hundred dollars then was more of a sacriﬁce for the .majority than a thousand dollars would be now. It would be less burdensome for this church and society to raise ﬁfteen thousand dollars to endow a Whitcomb professorship of theology, or a Cook’s Prairie professorship of natural sciences in Hillsdale college now, than it was to raise the few hundred dollar donated to establish Michigan Central college at Spring Arbor then. The school opened on the 4th day of Decem- ber, 1844. Henry R. Cook, Stella Mead and Laura Hayes from this church were among the ﬁrst students. During the ﬁrst term of the school the treas- ury and the wood pile of the institution were exhausted at the same time. Henry R. Cook volunteered to divide his time between his books and the woods. He shouldered his ax, and felled the trees in the woods, and pre-

: CHARTERS—POWER TO CONFER DEGREES 47 pared the timbers for the sleigh, a neighbor volunteered to haul the wood to the school room and Stephen Mead and others prepared it for the stove, and thus the members of this church, in that emergency, saved the infant college from freezing out and kept the school open. . The legislature of 1845 granted a charter to the school, but refused to give the authority to .confer degrees. Elijah Cook, Jr., was the ﬁrst trustee named in that charter. The ﬁrst building was commenced in 1845. Daniel Dunakin laid the stone foundation with his own hands as a part of his con- tribution to the enterprise. The charter of the college was amended in 1850 and the power to confer degrees was bestowed. This was the ﬁrst denomi- national college chartered in the state of Michigan and the ﬁrst ever chartered in the Freewill Baptist denomination. Elijah Cook. Daniel Dunakin, Eli T. Chase and E. H. Cook were among its most inﬂuential trustees. When the question of moving the college from Spring Arbor arose, the trustees from this church held the balance of power and turned the scale in favor of removal and thereby multiplied the usefulness and greatness of the college tenfold. These men staked their fortunes for this college enterprise. The old charter at Spring Arbor made the trustees jointly and severally liable for all judgments that should be obtained against the corporation. A suit was commenced against Elijah Cook, Daniel Dunakin and Eli T. Chase, im- pleaded with the Michigan Central college and other trustees, but a favorable decision of the court saved them from loss. Daniel Dunakin and Eli T. Chase were members of a committee of ﬁve selected by the board of trustees to determine the new location of the institution, and they joined in the report locating the college at Hillsdale. Eli T. Chase for some time held the title of the property at Hillsdale in trust for the college. After the grounds were obtained and the buildings were nearly completed at Hillsdale, the courts decided that the special charter granted to the school at Spring Arbor could not be used at Hillsdale without legislative consent. The new constitution of the state, which went into effect in 1851, prohibited all special college char- ters. It had been the established policy of our state up to that time to reserve the power of conferring collegiate degrees exclusively for the univer- sity. At that time the power to confer degrees had never been granted to any institution aside from the university, except to the Michigan Central college at Spring Arbor. In this case the legislature ﬁxed the standard of scholarship‘so high that it deemed it impossible for the institution to reach it, or the power would not then have been given. Daniel Dunakin was elected from this district to the house of representa- tives, in the state legislature, in 1854. He was on the prudential or building committee of the new college at Hillsdale without a charter and. had a deep
Page 48
> 48 . INFLUENCE OF THIS CHURCH ON EDUCATION interest in the enterprise. Undoubtedly he did more work than any other member of the legislature of 1855 to change the policy of the state and to secure the passage of the general college law. Largely through his inﬂuence the law was passed and Hillsdale college was the ﬁrst institution to incorpo- rate under its provisions. The policy of the state was changed and, as the result, we now have a number of ﬂourishing and useful denominational col- leges in the state. Daniel Dunakin and Elijah Cook were elected members of p the ﬁrst board of trustees at Hillsdale, and Mr. Dunakin served on the board until his death in 1875. Franklin Mead has also served on the board of trustees several terms. This church and society have contributed thousands of dollars to build and endow Hillsdale college, and have sent scores of students to its classic halls. Has this church, through its members, done any- thing for the educational cause? Samuel Whitcomb, the organizer and ﬁrst pastor of this church. was the pioneer leader in the educational movement of the denomination in the state of Michigan, and he can properly be called the father of Hillsdale college. He was the great leader in this march of progress in the peninsular state. And by his side, as he marshaled his forces to battle with prejudice and ignorance, as his wise counselors, eﬂicient supporters and trusted lieutenants. under the banner of progress, we always found Elijah Cook, Daniel Dunakin and Eli T. Chase. Had it not been for the far seeing sagacity and the early labors and brave leadership of these men action would not have been taken at Franklin, and the school would not have been opened at Spring Arbor in 1844. Had it not been for the inﬂuence and votes of the trustees from this church, in 1852 and 1853, the school would not have been removed to Hillsdale and to a broader ﬁeld of usefulness. In fact, had it not been for the lives and- labors of these men. the Freewill Baptist denomi- nation to-day would not have had its grandest possession. Hillsdale college, with its ﬁfteen thousand men and women, disciplined by its hand, scattered all over the world. Truly these fathers builded better than they knew, but they had the “hearts to conceive, the understandings to direct and the hands to execute.” ANTI-SLAVERY CAUSE It is now an easy matter to be opposed to human slavery; in fact it is almost impossible to ﬁnd a pro-slavery man or woman, north or south. It was not so forty years ago. The democratic party then in power favored slavery. the free-soil or Wilmot proviso wing of the party, was in the minority. The whig party at that time had a strong anti-slavery element, yet it was compro- mising with the devil on the slavery question. These two parties then moulded public sentiment and controlled legislative measures. In those days
Page 49
ANTI-SLAVERY CAUSE—PATRGITISM 49 to be an abolitionist was to be an object of derision and contempt. It required earnest convictions and moral courage for a. church to espouse the cause of the slave, and stamina of character and strong individuality for a man to defy the'prevailing sentiments and become an outspoken abolitionist. Early in the anti-slavery agitation this church took a decided stand, and on the 19th day of May, 1838, in its monthly covenant meeting, passed a resolution to do all that its members could consistently do to advance the cause of the aboli- tion of slavery. This church was in advance of the denomination on this question, for the Freewill Baptist denomination did not make the question of slave ownership a test of church fellowship and refuse to admit slave- holders to its communion until its general conference in 1839. Soon the individual members of this church began to sever their relations with the old political parties on account of their positions on the institution of slavery. In 1844 Eli T. Chase voted with the abolition party, when it cast only eleven votes in the township of Eckford. ‘Soon after Samuel Whitcomb, John Whitcomb, Elijah Cook, E. H. Cook, Horace B. Hayes and others whose names I cannot now give, became champions for the African slave and voted the abolition ticket. I can recall some of the sneers that were directed against these advance guards of universal freedom. When we remember that _it is often easier to be shot at than to be laughed at, we can form some idea of the strong convictions and moral courage of these men in those early days. In 1854 Eli T. Chase, E. H. Cook and Daniel Dunakin were members of that immortal convention “under the oaks at Jackson,” and helped organize the republican party; that instrument, in the hands of God, which destroyed the hideous institution of slavery in our land and gave back to the African race the God given right of liberty. PATRIOTISM This church and society has not been wanting in patriotic efforts. They contributed liberally of their means and sent scores of men to vindicate the America ﬂag, and to serve the union on the bloody ﬁeld of battle. Among these patriots who gave their lives for their country I ﬁnd the names of Smith Rhodes, Orlando Crocker, Harrison Richey and Cicero Kennedy on your church roll, and from your society I recall the names of Sewall A. Jen- nison, Hoyt Henshaw, Sylvester Mumbrue, Lester Mumbrue and Bert. Spauld- ing. Some died in the dismal camp, some on the ﬁeld of battle, and some starved in the loathsome prison pen. “Dust may return to dust, but deep Within the hearts of freedom's sons, Embalmed forever, love shall keep
Page 50
50 MISSIONARY CAUSE The memory of these faithful ones; And coming years shalI swell our lays And weave new laurels for each head, While grateful freemen sing the praise Forever due our noble dead". MISSIONARY CAUSE II‘his church has contributed something, at least, to the cause of missions. The ladies have not only maintained their church society here, but have extended their labors over broader ﬁelds. The Freewill Baptist Woman’s Missionary Society of the Calhoun and North Branch quarterly meeting and the Woman’s Missionary Society of the St. Joseph Valley yearly meeting were organized, and, to a great extent, have been conducted by the ladies of this church. This church, this quarterly meeting and this yearly meeting all owe their ﬂourishing missionary organizations to the ladies of the Cook’s Prairie church. The labors of Mrs. 'Electa Potterson French, Mrs. Julia Hofer Cook and Mrs. Alma Dtunakin Owens and their co-workers from this church will not soon be forgotten. The seed that they have sown will bring forth fruit throughout the world wherever Freewill Baptist missionaries are spreading the gospel of Christ. CONCLUSION This chhrch has lived and labored ﬁfty years. Has it fulﬁlled its high mission? Will it live and labor another ﬁfty years? Who of us will be present at the centennial anniversary of this church ﬁfty years from now? Will this church be visible then? These questions come crowding upon us at this hour. This church to-day has one hundred and ﬁfty members bound together by the strongest ties of harmony and brotherly love. It owns this neat and valuable church property and is free from debt. Its wealth has in- creased since the fathers commenced to worship here ﬁfty fold. I can see no reason why this church vine should not grow, be thrifty and bring forth rich fruit at the end of the century. The fact that one of the original thirteen members is with us to-night, though past three score years and ten, yet young and joyous in spirit, gives us hope that many of the church and society of to- day will live to celebrate the next semi-centennial anniversary and carry the traditions of the present time to that generation, as Mr. Chase to-night brings the traditions of the fathers and spreads them before us. What a rare combination of privileges Mr. Eli T. Chase has enjoyed. How appropriate it is that he, as chairman of the executive committee, should have charge of this anniversary celebration. He is not only the sole surviVOr of the church as organized ﬁfty years ago, but is the only man now residing in the township
Page 51
MORAL AND SOCIAL INFLUENCE OF THIS‘CHURCH 51 who voted at the ﬁrst township meeting held in Eckt'ord in 1836, and is the only man surviving who voted at that election except Andrew Herrick, now of Homer. As a man of deeds, not of words, he has taken an active part in the religious and social questions of this church and community, and has participated in the educational and political alfairs in his township, county and state. ' He has lived to see the educational movement triumph in his denomination, and the sentiment of his church completely revolutionized on the subject. He has lived not only to see the institution of slavery wiped out, but to see the slave made a citizen and enfranchised. What a blessing to see these fond hopes all realized. He has helped to make this history, and now it must be a source of great satisfaction to him, and it will be a support to him in his declining years to feel conscious that the world is freer, wiser and better for his having lived in it. \Ve have consecrated grounds in our midst. Just across the way in your beautiful prairie cemetery are the graves of Samuel Whitcomb, Elijah Cook, Catherine Cook, Daniel Dunakin, Eliza Ann ISunakin, Jacob Rosecratz, Clarissa Rosecrantz and John Blake, eight of the ﬁrst members of this church—eight of the founders of this church ﬁfty years ago. In the wilder- ness they planted it for me and you. With grateful hearts let us ever cherish their memories, and as spring time shall come in each ﬂeeting year, cover their graves with sweetest ﬂowers of love. Let every Spring Arbor and Hillsdale student remember that to Samuel “'hitcomb, Elijah Cook, Daniel Dunakin, Eli T. Chase, E. ,H. Cook and Franklin Mead he owes a personal debt of gratitude. Let every Freewill Baptist who appreciates the progress of his denomination and its educational institutions remember that here the seed was sown and here the plan was conceived and here the inﬂuences were started, out of which has grown Hillsdale college. Let the christian and‘the patriot remember that this church has been on the right side of all great, moral and religious questions, has been in the front ranks of many of the reform movements of the day, and has done much for right living, for right ruling, for man and for God. From the achievements of these humble men, under God’s blessing, may we not learn a lesson and take courage, remembering that “We live in deeds, not yeais, in thou hts, not breaths, In feelings, not in ii res on a dis . We should count time y heart throbs. He most lives Who thinks most, feels the noblest, acts the best."

52 METHODIST EPISCOPAL CHURCH AT GALESBURG HISTORY OF THE METHODIST EPISCOPAL CHURCH AT GALES- ’ ' BURG

CONTRIBUTED BY A. D. P. VAN BUREN [John S. Martin, in Galesburg Enterprise, June 12, 1885.] The Methodist Episcopal society, in connection with Galesburg and vicinity, was organized in July, 1838, by Rev. James T. Robe, now living in Kalamazoo. Its membership at that date were Jabez Rogers, wife and daughter, Mrs. Warden, Moses McClellan and wife, Mrs. Hannah Austin, Mrs. Luke Rugg, Mrs. J. Burnette and son—nine persons. Their place of worship from the date of organization to 1837 was Mr. Rogers’ residence, a double log house that stood on the west side of the present David Vosburg farm; from 1837 to 1840 in a log school-house built on Henry Rogers’ farm, now owned by Luther Eldred; from 1840 to 1845 in a frame school-house 15 rods north from the southwest corner of Ralph Tuttle's farm, now owned by Mr. Carr; from 1845 to 1848 in the Baptist church in this village; from 1848 to 1852 in the Presbyterian church; then one year in the "Variety Store,”_now a part of Mr. Knapp’s present residence; then for a time in the Baptist church again. In January, 1855, their ﬁrst house of worship was dedicated; built where the Adventist church now stands. They occupied this church until June, 1871, when it was burned to the ground, without insurance. They met then for a short time in the Baptist church again until the basement of their present ediﬁce was ready for occupancy. On December 23, 1875, the church wa ﬁnished and dedicated and the society has worshiped in it to the present date. The following ministers have served the society from its organization, ﬁgures below being date of appointment:

54 ' MICHIGAN TERRITORY IN 1820 EARLY MICHIGAN BY \K'ILLIAM H. CROSS [Read before the Branch County Pioneer Society, December 28, 1885.] Michigan territory'in 1820 had a population of 8,765; in 1830, 31,639. It then comprised all the territory north and west of Ohio, Indiana and Illinois, and east of the Misissippi. In 1834 was added to it all the country west of the Mississippi river and north of Missouri, with a delegate in Congress to ask for what he wished, but with no vote to give to obtain it.“ How is it today? We have Michigan, Wisconsin, Iowa, Minnesota, Nebraska, Colorado, with twelve United States senators, nearly one seventh of the senate, forty one members of the house of representatives, over one eighth of that house, and much more than one eighth of the brains and busi- ‘ ness of either house, with over 9,000,000 of the best educated, intelligent, active and independent inhabitants of the globe; and this is what Michigan of 1834 has become in 1885, within ﬁfty one years. The world does move in the northwest. My ﬁrst fall and winter in Michigan and my ﬁrst night, ﬁfty nine years ago, were spent in the woods alone. 0n the last day of September, 1826, I came to Tecumseh, on the river Raisin, the then westernlfarming settlement of the territory, consisting of about twenty ﬁve families. The next day but one ( the ﬁrst being Sunday) I went to work for Peter Low. digging potatoes. I worked ten days and was taken with a severe attack of bilious dysentery and was unable to do any work for four weeks. I then went with my brother Robert J., who had-been preparing a place and cutting logs for 'a house on our.lands, four miles above the village and two from any settler, to assist him what I could and be company for him. Through the month of Decem- ber we got our house up. a building of 16x18 feet inside, with a shingle roof, two ﬂoors, a glass window. and board doors; a decidedly aristocratic mansion for those days. for it had a stick chimney above the edge of the roof. About the middle of January our stock of corn. on which we depended for our corn meal for bread and for feeding a. team of oxen, had got so low that it became necessary for one' of us to go to Monroe, thirty ﬁve miles, for that and other
Page 55
GOING TO MARKET 55 needed supplies for winter and spring. I was not strong enough to chop but thought I could go, and left with my oxen and sled, the snow being nearly a foot deep. The ﬁrst day I went about twenty miles to the mouth of the Saline river, the next day to Monroe, and traded some deer skins and peltries we had got of the Indians, and with a little money bought a barrel of Ohio ﬂour, a barrel of salt, a few groceries, nails and other needed indispensable things for cabin use, and, with what corn I could haul, got back seven miles toward home. Next day I got to what was known as the Big Prairie, where were some stacks of hay, put up by Mr. Evans, of Tecumseh. As I neared the prairie, I cut a number of logs of beech and maple wood, loaded them on my sled to make a ﬁre with when I got to the hay stacks, and just at dusk I got there. when I took the cattle from the sled, turned them in their yoke to the side of the stacks and let them help themselves, and I made a ﬁre with my wood, then thawed out some bread and pork I had with me, which was hard frozen, made my supper, and creeping into the hay stack as far as I ' could, with my blankets, made myself as comfortable as I could for that severely cold night, being eight miles from a settler’s cabin, that being my ﬁrst night in the woods alone. The next day I got home, ome seventeen miles, about sundown, with my load of about 1,200 pounds of much needed things for future use. ‘ ‘ FIRST WINTER IN COLDWATER, 1830—31. After the winter of 1826-7 we spent three more winters in Tecumseh, making improvements on our farms, but in June, 1830, we sold out our farms there, and in October, 1830, bought that part of your city lying on the east three- fourths of section 21. The four winters spent on the Raisin made us con~ clude that the winters of Michigan were much less severe than they were in Ontario county, N. Y., for they had proved so; but those of 1830-31 and 1831-2, the ﬁrst we spent in Coldwater, forced us to the conclusion that either a change - from the eastern watershed to the western made harder winters, hr that the Indians were correct in their declaration that the white men brought more snow and colder weather with them to kill off their ponies and the game upon which they depended for their living, for these ﬁrst two winters, 1830-1 and 1831-2, were much more severe than any we had before met in Michigan. And these winters we had to bring our provisions for ourselves, and most of our corn and grain and part of our hay for our stock from Tecumseh, nearly sixty miles, and on stich roads as the frontiersmen had opened on the line of the Indian trail, with not a stream bridged but all to be forded. and it was cheerfully done, for our hearts were strong. our minds determihed. Our anticipations of good farms, freedom from rents, independence from land- lords and from being required to change places at another man’s command,

EARLY DAYS IN MICHIGAN 57 No doubt there are others, but I am not sure, and I hope may be added those from your own county besides our old friend Allen Tibbits as above. What a host of memories must William B. Sprague have in store, who has lived in every president‘s time from Washington to Cleveland. EARLY DAYS IN MICHIGAN BY ALFRED L. BRIGGS, OF CONSTANTINE [From the St. Joseph County Advertiser, July 9, 1885.] . There are few persons now living, who. from personal experience, have any idea of the trials, adventures and hardships of those who, over 50 years ago, went into the wilderness of Michigan to carve out homes for themselves. It must be hard for the present inhabitants of this densely populated, highly cultivated and prosperous state to realize that but little more than 50 years ago it was really and truly a howling wilderness—the home of wild animals, and Indians, more savage and more dreaded than the wild animals. It seems almost like a dream that all this growth ‘and improvement had so recent a beginning. While enjoying the bountiful present, a knowledge of the past and of the early days in Michigan will not be unproﬁtable, and I trust not uninteresting. By request of some of my friends, I will give a partial sketch of events, and my experience the ﬁrst ﬁve years in Michigan. At the age of 21 I left my parents’ home in Middleburgh, Schoharie county. N. Y.. on the ﬁrst day of May, 1831. for Michigan. I arrived in Detroit, I think, on the 13th, and three days later at Jackson. The county seat had just been located there. I soon rented the only saw mill in the county, near the village, which I ran until the middle of July, when I was taken with the ague. and had it on and off until the ﬁrst of October. I then left Jackson for White Pigeon in company with Daniel Hogan, then va mer- chant at Jackson. who had a horse and buggy. At that time there was not a bridge over any river, creek, or marsh between Jackson and White Pigeon. 8 .
Page 58
i 58 EXPERIENCES FIFTY YEARS AGO There were only two rough board houses at Marshall; only two buildings at Kalamazoo, a log house by Bronson, the ﬁrst settler in the town, and a board shanty by an Indian trader, named Austin. I left Kalamazoo for White Pigeon, at that time the only place of trade, except Niles, in southwest Michigan. At White Pigeon there were three stores, by Barry 8: Willard. E. Swan, and Kellogg Brothers; a ﬁne hotel kept by A. Savery, the only land ofﬁce in the west part of the state. I boarded at the hotel, having the ague part of the time. I left “'hite Pigeon the. fore part of January, 1832. for Detroit, with the intention of returning to New York in the spring, in case I did not get rid of the ague. I had a ride to Hog Creek, 30 miles east of White Pigeon. I stopped over night at a log house kept by Judson. My bed was on the bare ﬂoor, with no clothing except what I had on. At that place two men from the east, Wales Adam and William A. Kent, had just built a cheap saw mill on Hog Creek, and neither had any knowledge about a mill. They induced me to stop over a few days and instruct them. While I was at White Pigeon I formed the acquaintance of a young man by the name of King, from Connecticut. He was at the hotel with the ague while I was there; he had heard I was stopping at Hog Creek; he came to see me and ask me if I knew of any speculation. I told him I had examined a good mill site two miles nerth on Swan creek, in ﬁrst-rate heavy timber land. I told him I had no means to improve the site (I had the previous fall entered the land on Broad street, where O. C. M. Bates now resides). He convinced me he had sufﬁcient means to improve the site. We at once entered into partnership, he to furnish the means and I the experience. Without delay we commenced,—about the middle of February,—cutting roads, building a log house, and getting out timber for a saw mill frame; we had hardly commenced getting the timber out when he received word from his friends east that he had better locate further west; he left me with a lot of hands and not ﬁfteen dollars at my command; he assigned over to me what he had advanced. and I was to pay him in two years. I went on with the improvement. I could obtain anything I wished on time. my credit was unlimited, better than it is at this time. My mill was framed and raised. I found a millwright. I previously bought a yoke of oxen and a wagon on time. I sent one of my hands with the ox team to Detroit for the irons and castings. as they could not be obtained nearer. I had previously engaged them. I was endorsed by Oliver Raymond. who was at that time a resident of Sturgis, and was well acquainted with the furnace man, A. M. Hurd. My man was obliged to stay at Detroit until the mill irons were completed. I sent my note payable one year from date for $150. twprey'ious agreement. I started the mill about the middle

_ EXPERIENCES FIFTY YEARS AGO 59 of October. I settled with the millwright by giving him my note for $125, payable one year from date. After I started the mill I had only cut a few logs when the dam broke and came near upsetting the mill. I soon repaired both mill and dam, and started the mill again. For more than four months I was not out of sight of the mill, and ran it alone that time eighteen hours out of every twenty four. I soon had piles of lumber about the mill. after supplying the demand in Branch and St. Joseph counties, but I was heavily in debt and must raise money and was at a loss how. The roads through the heavy timber lands were impassable to haul half a load. 'There was no snbw that winter, and I was obliged to haul logs on trucks. I conceived the idea of clearing out the creek about ﬁve miles to the openings for the purpose of conveying my lumber to some market. I hired the only man who was will- ing to assist me in the tedious job of working in ice water in the month of March. The creek was cleared. I then employed men rafting the lumber in cribs, some 1,500 feet in a crib. One man on a crib with a pole would run down the creek some ﬁve miles to a bank in the openings, haul it out. and that was his day’s labor. That was repeated, rafting and running till I had about 100,000 feet on the bank. Then I hired teams to haul the lumber to Colon lake and St. Joseph river. Then it was rafted and run down said river to the mouth and Lake Michigan. There was but little or no demand for lumber there. ~ I was told they had started a town across the lake at the mouth of Chicago river, where it was thought I might make sale of my lumber. There was a vessel lying there-4 think-the only one on Lake Michigan—- with part of a load of ﬂour bound for that town across the lake. I bar- gained with the captain to put a deck load of lumber on his vessel. I also chartered the vessel to return and take a cargo. I was to pay $200. We came in sight of the town; the vessel was anchored over half a mile from shore, the lumber put on a. scow and rowed in the river and put on the bank. There was no harbor there. I soon ascertained I had come to a poor market to sell my lumber, about 20,000 feet of clear whitewood. I at last made sale to a man by the name of Williams who was then keeping a 7 x 9 grocery. He was the only man there who was able to purchase the lumber. There were at that time about a dozen cheap houses or shanties. and one respectable one, called a hotel, the only one that had any paint on 'it, was located where the Tremont house now stands. There was a fort. and soldiers sta- tioned there, which was commanded by Col. Whistler. I was in the place two days, intending to leave for home the next morning and not return to St. Jo. for the cargo I had bargained for. I was aware I could not sell it. Late in the afternoon my friend \Villiams was hunting for me to inform me the

60 EARLY SURVEYS \ captain of the vessel had taken out a warrant to arrest me for a breach of contract for not returning for the cargo, as he had heard from some source I would not. I was not long paying my bill at the hotel, and struck out for the beach of the lake. I traveled some time after dark, I think about 15 miles. Was out of the state and safe. That was the ﬁrst and only time I ever ran away from an ofﬁcer. I stopped over night at a log but near the beach. The man had a squaw for his wife.‘ I took to the beach next morning, by way of Michigan City and Laporte, home. I also ran another raft the next year. 1834, down the river to the lake. In the month of June, 1836, I sold my mill and 400 acres of heavy timber land adjoining, for $4,500, and other lands, etc., for $1,500. Chicago was then heard of. Some thought it might make a smart town. I thought I might speculate. I went there on horseback with $6,000 on my person. I could then have bought hundreds of acres now cov- ered with buildings. I did not invest. I thought it only av mushroom town located on a wet marsh. There had been considerable improvement made since I saw it three years previous, in very cheap houses, even a small brick one. I returned with my money. I bought that summer twenty two hundred acres of land in Branch and St. Joseph counties and the following fall bought and built on Broad street. THE EARLY SURVEYS OF MICHIGAN WasnnvoroN, MICH., June 12, 1886.? Harm'et A. Ten-neg, Recording See, State Pioneer Society. Lansing: MADAM—I enclose to your address a paper in reference to the public land surveys of Michigan, which may be of interest and worthy of preservation. Having been an active participant in these surveys since 1840, and knowing many of the deputy surveyors, am pleased to note a desire on the part of those who would preserve historical data and reminiscences of the past to deal justly and secure accuracy. In vol. 5, page 115, of the “State Pioneer Collections.” the paper entitled “The life and times of William A. Burt, of Mt. Vernon. Michigan.” shOuld be credited to Geo. H. Cannon, of Washing- ton, Macomb county, Michigan, and not, as it erroneously is, to Scott Cannon, as no such person is known to exist. With great respect, etc., GEORGE H. CANNON.

GEORGE H. CANNON. Dept. Surveyor U. S. Lands. Washington, Midn, December 96, 1882. To the Editor of the Post and Tribwne: In your issue of December 27 I ﬁnd the following from the pen of Mr. George H. Cannon, the well known surveyor and “land-looker" of Macomb county: In a recent number of your paper Mr. George S. Frost, in his historical address, is represented as saying that “Mr. Trowbridge copied a list of the names of the white inhabitants of the territory for the census of 182 ." And after recounting the places of settlement which were then over that vast country, says: “The public surveys had not yet extended even into this peninsula." This is an error. as the linear surveys of that date had occupied a large area of the southern portion of the territory; parts of Oakland and Macomb counties having been surveyed as early as 1817 and 1818. I think that the following will show that an attempt, at least, was made to survey a portion of our state as early as 1815, although Mr. Cannon places the earliest date at 1817. The documeny which I copy below is on ﬁle at the general land ofﬁce at Washington, and through the courtesy of the Hon. E. M. Marble, United States commissioner of patents. several months ago. a copy was secured for me from the Hon. A. C. McFarland, commissioner of the general land ofﬁce. In addition to establishing a date I think it will prove of interest to your many readers as illustrating in what opinion the lands of our beautiful Openinsula were held in 181'5. It is proper to add that, acting upon the suggestion of the surveyor general, the congress repealed the act making appropriation of Michigan lands for the soldiers and I think appropriated other lands in lieu thereof located in Florida. The document referred to I have never seen in print, and I copy it verbatim as follows: Sunvrzvon GENERAL'S OFFICE. } Chillicothe, November 30, 1816. Sm:— The surveyors who went to survey the military land in Michigan Territory have been obliged to suspend their operations until the country shall be sufficiently frozen so as to bear man and beast. Knowing the desire of the government to have the lands surveyed as soon as practicable. and my earnest importunities to urge the work forward, they continued at work suffering incredible hardships until both men and beasts were literally worn down with extreme suffering and fatigue—the frost set in early, and the ice covered nearly the whole country, but broke through at every step, and the pack horses could not be got along with them, they were therefore obliged to submit to the climate and its'attendant rigors, and desist for awhile, intending to attack them again as soon as they think it possible to proceed. I annex a description of the country which has been sent to me and which I am informed all the surveyors concur in, it was only yesterday I received it and heard of their return—so soon as their health and strength is recruited I expect to see them all, only one of them having been here yet—in the mean time I think it my duty to give you the information, believing that it is the wish of the government that the soldiers should have (as the act of congress expresses) lands ﬁt for cultivation, and that the whole of the two millions of acres appropriated in the territory of Michigan will not contain anything like one hundredth part of that quantity.

62 CORRESPONDENCE CONCERNING SURVEYS or is worth the expenses of surveying it, perhaps you may think with me, that it will be proper to make this representation to the president of the United States and he may avert all further proceedings—by directing me to pay off what has been done and abandon the country—congress being in session other lands could be appropriated in lieu of them and might be surveyed as soon as those in Michigan—for when the ice is sufficiently stiong to bear man and beast, a deep snow would still embarrass the surveyors. I shall therefore wait to hear your answer to this communication before I proceed any further thinking I should be unfaithful to my trust it I had lost any time in communicating the information received. The country in the Indian boundary line from the mouth of the great Auglaize river and running thence for about 50 miles is (with some few exceptions) low wet Land with a very thick growth of underbrush, inter- mixed with beech, cottonwoods~ oak, etc, from thence continuing and extending from the Indian boundary line eastward. the number and extent of the swamps increases, with the addition of numbers of lakes from 20 chains to two and three miles across. Many of the lakes have extensive marshes adjoining their margins, sometimes thickly covered with a species of pine called “Taniirak,” and other places covered with a_ coarse high grass, and uniformly covered from six inches to three feet [and more at times) with water. The margin of these lakes are not the only places where swamps are found, for they are interspersed throughout the whole country and ﬁlled with water as above stated, and varying in extent. The immediate space between these swamps and lakes, which is probably near one-half of the country, is, with a very few exceptions, a, poor, barren, sandy loam land, on which scarcely any vegetation grows, except. very small scrubby oaks.\ In many places that part which may be called dry land is composed of little short sand hills, forming a kind of deep basins, the bottoms of many of which are composed of a_ marsh similar to those above described—the streams are generally narrow and very deep compared with their width; the shores and bottoms of which are (with a, very few exceptions) swamp beyond description; and it is with the utmost difficulty that a place can be found over which horses can be conveyed. A circumstance peculiar to that, country is exhibited in many of the marshes; by their being thinly covered with a sward of grass, by walking on which evinced the existence_of water or a very thin mud immediately under that thin covering, which sinks from 6 to 18 inches from_the pressure of the foot in every step, and at. the same time rising before and behind the person passing over. The margins of many of the lakes and streams are in a similar situation, and in many places are literally aﬂoat. 0n approaching the eastern part of the military lands towards the private claims on the strait and lake the country does not contain so many swamps and lakes, but the extreme sterility and barrenness of the soil ' continues the same—taking the country altogether so far as has been explored and to all appearances together with the information received concerning the balance, is as bad—there would not be more than one acre out of a hundred, if there would be one out. of a thousand that would in any case admit of cultivation. With great. respect I am your obedient. servant, EDWARD TIFFIN. The Hon. Josiah Mu'gs, Commissioner G. L. oﬂice, ll’ashington. J The above is an accurate copy, including peculiarities of orthography, punctuation, grammer, etc. _ Imagine the shade of our former surveyor general visiting again the scenes of his early life at Chillicothe, at Tiﬂin, Ohio, and then making a. rapid journey across the territory of 'Michigan in any direction. Possibly, however, he was misled by willful misrepresentation on the part of his surveyors. An example of that kind can be cited in relation to the alleged “survey” of some of our northern counties. Take, for example, Gladwin county: there is probably nowhere in the west a county that is so inaccurately surveyed as it is; indeed. it is generally believed that the party of surveyors who were to lay out that county. and upon whose skill generations of people must depend for accurate descriptions of their farms and homes, got on a big drunk of ten days’ duration at the old "Webster House,” in Saginaw City, and actu-

' May it not be presumed that much of the odium which for many years attached to Michigan, and which materially retarded its settlement, may be directly traceable to the inﬂuence which the promulgation of the above report in congress had upon the minds of those people who were seeking new homes in the then far west?

64 CONSULTING AUTHORITIES with this dry subject, right after the delightful music, right after the address of Dr. Alger, the “Old Man Eloquent,” and the interesting and touching tribute by Hon. Harvey Haynes to the memory of Hon. Roland Root and others of our fellow pioneers who have left us during the past year. I had a vague idea that the town of Green was lying about here somewhere or had been here sometime, but just where and when I did not know. Consulting encycloptedias brought no consolation. There was nothing in the American, Johnson’s, Chambers‘ or Britannica about this ancient town. Almost as a last resort I consulted the president’s message, but although it contained everything else, he had, alas, forgotten to speak of the town of Green. Then I consulted the statutes of the Michigan Territorial Council and talked with the oldest pioneers, who were in Michigan before I was born. We came here in 1835, but when we arrived the town of Green had had its brief career and had passed into history. We came to the place where this old town was, but it was here no, more forever. Yes, Branch county was once the town of Green. Not this county alone but Eaton and Calhoun and “all the country north of Eaton” composed this town. The section of this act organizing this town was approved Nov. 5, 1829, and reads as follows: Sec. 5. That the counties of Branch, Calhoun and Eaton and all the country lying north of the county of Eaton, which are attached to and compose a part of the county of St. Joseph, shall form a township by the name of Green, and the ﬁrst township meeting shall be held at the house of Jabez Bronson in said township' The house where the meeting.to elect township ofﬁcers was held was in that part of the town of Green which was some years afterwards named Bron- son, after Jabez Bronson. It was a long, low, log house, but however low, such houses always had a chamber above for sleeping room. It was a little way back from the street, near where the ﬂouringlmill now stands. This building, notable as the birthplace of the olden town, was at the same time a private residence, a hotel, a town house and the seat of justice. By law the courts could not be held in a bar room. In this house it was the only room large enough for that purpose. But the sturdy pioneer,iBr0nson. was equal to emergency. He had the liquors removed to a rear room just before the court convened. Then the justice. who was Mr. Bronson, with due solemnity, correctly proclaimed, “Gentlemen, this is not a bar room, but a court room,” and thereupon he would proceed with thetrial, no one- ques- tioning the correctness of his statement. When the town of Green was organized there were justices of the peace to be provided. and Governor Cass appointed Mr. Bronson, who was the ﬁrst judicial oﬂicer in Branch county. He removed from Connecticut in 1828 to Bronson’s Prairie, which was named for him. He was about 50 years of age, a ship builder by occupation. In his travels to the west he married a Canada widow and they came on to
Page 65
JABEZ BRONSON—PIONEER 65 Branch county. In trying cases he depended more upon his judgment than on the territorial statutes. He was not educated. He was also the early postmaster. Bronson held courts for about one year before they were held in any other place in the county. For many years Bronson's Prairie was the favorite resort of lawyers, the litigation being extensive. The itinerant ped- dler was often a victim in this court. Passing through, he was arrested and required to show his license.\ If he had none he was ﬁned to the extreme penalty of the law. It he was authorized, in some way he still had to pay the costs of court. It was in the house of the pioneer Jabez Bronson where the ﬁrst election of the great town of Green was held—a town that embraced several counties and somewhat over. These large towns existed in the days when Michigan ter- ritory reached to the Mississippi and shortly after to the Missouri—as Michi- gan has always been a growing state.“ Counties sometimes were very large. Brown and Michilimackinac 'counties once reached across the lake into what is now Wisconsin. The people were few and could not ﬁll the land, and so the land reached out and took in the people. Wayne was the ﬁrst great county. '. In 1796 it was all of lower Michigan, part of upper Michigan, part of Indiana and Ohio, and extended over into Wisconsin.‘ It had subsequently reductions and enlargements by proclama- tions or statutes until it took its present form in 1826. Brown, Crawford and Michilimackinac counties were striking examples of this reaching out to take in all the people. By the proclamation of Gov. Cass in October, 1818, they comprised the entire Michigan territory, to which the Indian title had been extinguished, reaching to the Mississippi, excepting .the counties of Wayne, Monroe and Macomb, which were then about their present dimensions. The changes in the geography of this state. from its French occupation over two hundred and ﬁfty years ago, would form an interesting study. And the maps showing the English settlements and control, the extinguishment of the Indian titles by treaty after our government ascendancy. would be very valuable. That Massachusetts and Connecticut once projected through southern Michigan is an intereting fact, and like many others relative to our early history, is little known. But for a town our hero Green was greater than any county was for a county. I do not know of any town that ever had so much true greatness. I ﬁnd no records of the ﬁrst town meeting held in the log house of Jabez Bronson. I can see who are there, certainly Bronson; Richardson, and some, if not all, of the other ofﬁcers who were elected. Probably there were not over twenty or thirty voters present. There is said to be no record of the second meeting of the town of Green. But the reports'of the ofﬁcers elected and * See appendix. page 54 9 s

66 EARLY TOWN MEETINGS IN GREEN their other ofﬁcial acts show there was such an election. The Hon. William H. Cross, now living in Center-ville, and who was present at the seéond town meeting in 1831, writes me: "The town meeting was held at the old Trading House on the west bank of Coldwater river in 1831, the ﬁrst Monday in April. Co]. A. F. Bolton was occupying the old building, making prep- arations for the erection of a hotel on the east side of the stream, then being put up for him by Harvey “'arner. After selecting Col. Bolton for chair- man, and John Morse and Columbia. Lancaster, then of Bronson, as clerks. we elected John Morse town clerk, Seth Dunham, of Bronson, supervisor, John G. Richardson, collector and Willard Pierce, Edward S. Hanchett and myself as commissioners of highways, besides three assessors. There were about thirty persons present. Of these there are' only two besides myself now living. One is Willard Pierce, who returned east and a short time since ‘was living in Connecticut. The other is Columbia Lancaster, now of Van- couver, Washington territory. He was the second lawyer in St. Joseph county and has for forty years been a prominent citizen of Oregon and Washington territories, and-at one time a delegate in Congress." But the third meeting is recorded. It "was at Pocahontas Mills, near Branch, April 2, 1832—0ver 53 years ago. An interesting feature of this meeting was the auditing of the account of John G. Richardson. the town collector for 1831 and 1832. The amount presented showed he had collected taxes to the amount of $56.82 and had actually paid out $59.32, leaving his due $2.50. What a. contrast between 1831-2 and 1885! I think the present assessed valuation of Branch county alone, which is not one tenth of the old town of Green, is $17,000,000. This year our taxes are higher than usual, and if they are one per cent on the valuation—and they approximate that probably—then the amount of taxes we pay in 1885 will be about $170,000. Don't we poor tax ridden modern citizens, when think- ing of those halcyon days of low taxes and little property, wish we were back again enjoying the thirties? There is, however, nothing so interesting to me- as the consideration of the names and characteristics of the town oﬂicials of' Green. I know more about them than I do of the town which they survived. I well remember the ancient collector of taxes, John G. Richardson. My father bought his farm near Bronson village, and he then moved farther east into the woods. He was a strong, healthy hunter. neverhad the ague, killed many a deer, never did much farm work, spent years in devising a perpetual motion, which never moved. But the greater dream of his life, in that long ago, was to go far away to the Paciﬁc, to Oregon. But he died many years since on his farm on the west line of Bethel. near Bronson, and never saw his
Page 67
EARLY TOWN OFFICERS—NAME 67 dreams of Oregon or a perpetual motion realized. His widow remarried and I, as solicitor, procured a divorce for her second husband on the ground of desertion. She was, I think, the ﬁrst white woman who settled in Branch county and the mother of the ﬁrst white child born in this county, and in that part that it would seem was then about the most prominent in the county. At that town meeting others were elected to ofﬁce whose names are very familiar to us, who still survive, beloved and honored: William H. Cross, treasurer; Allen Tibbits, commissioner of schools and assessor; and Harvey Warner, overseer of highways for Coldwater Prairie. It was voted at this meeting that the next town meeting should be held at the house of John Morse, which is the present old Phoenix House in Goldwater. - The life of the town of Green was as brief as brilliant. Measured by the importance of historicial facts connected with it, some might compute its life as lengthy, but its years, as measured by the-sun struggling through our then miasmatic atmosphere, was only about three. In 1832. on the re-organiza- tion of townships, the name of Green was dropped; the west half of Branch county being named Prairie River, from a stream in the southwestern part now called Hog Creek, while the east part of the county was called Goldwater. But though the legislative council, in 1832, crowded the name of Green off the atlas, yet some one still clung to the ancient name. Here is a ringing section that is given with an emphasis by an act of the legislative council, April 23, 1833: “SEC. 1. Be it enacted by the legislative council of the territory of Michigan, that the township of Prairie River, in the county of Branch, shall be called Green, and by this name of Green shall hereafter be known and distinguished, any law to the contrary notwithstanding.” The italics are mine, and seem necessary to give the spirit of the one who drafted the section. It is written as though it closed a dispute and settles the fact that Green was to be remembered. This brought Green to the front again. It was not so large as it once was, but it comprised several of the present townships. It was big enough to feel pretty well, but alas, its glory was transient. It ﬂashed up a moment only to go out in darkness forever. This town of Green, the grandchild of the greater Green, was born April 23, 1833, and the legislative council gave it life; but March 11, 1837, there was an act by a new power. Michigan had becomea state, and then the legisla- ture, by an act to organize townships, enacted this section: “Sec. 60. All that portion of the county of Branch known as the town- ship of Prairie River and the village in said town known as York shall, on and after the ﬁrst Monday of April next, be known and designated by the name of Bronson.”
Page 68
68 CHANGE OF NAME \ Please note that this act makes no reference to the act of 1833, which changed the name of Prairie River to Green. It ignores it—boycotts it en- tirely. Whether the legislature considered the act of 1833 unconstitutional. or desired to how a lack of respect to the memory of Green, history does not relate. Hence the second existence of Green was longer than the ﬁrst. being three years, ten months and eighteen days. and then passed off from our county atlas forever. It became onﬁo‘iifflf 8;“33 E}??? we“ 8°“e' ' Why the name of Green had become unpopular I cannot tell. No aged pioneer can tell me why it came or why it went. The name of Prairie River was soon lost for both town and stream. though the Hon. Wales Adams. who owned a saw mill on the creek where it ran slow and up hill by the marsh to 'turn the wheels, strove to have the name retained, but it soon degenerated into “Hog Creek.” I think the town was named for General Green, but I do 'not know. No pioneer I have asked can tell me. They were probably not consulted, nor the town either. the territorial council, in their wisdom and discretion, ﬁxing upon this name. In size the town must have had some- thing over 1,800 square miles, to say nothing of “all the country lying north of Eaton,” which, unless explained by statute. reached to the north pole. and certainly to Mackinac. But the statute of Nov. 4. 1829, in establishing St. Joseph and Cass counties, included Kalamazoo, Branch, Barry and Eaton counties for judicial purposes, as a part of St. Joseph county, explains the expression “all the country lying north of Eaton.” In the statute of Nov; 4, 71829, the expression is used, "all the country lying north of township number four north (being the north line of Eaton) of the base line. west of the prin-/ cipal meridian and south of the county of Michilimackinac and east of the line between ranges twelve and thirteen.” This tract is attached to St. J oseph for judicial purposes and by the act organizing the town of Green is made a part of it. This is a triangular tract boundary commencing at the intersec- tion of the principal meridian with the north line of Ingham, thence west about ﬁfty miles to a point about four miles west of the southeast corner of Kent, thence northeast to the headwater of Thunder Bay river or the south- west corner of Montmorency county, thence south on the principal meridian, about 150 miles to the place of beginning. making a tract containing about 3,750 square miles. Add to this the about 1.800 square miles of Branch, Calhoun and Eaton and the town of Green contained about 5.550 square miles, being in extreme length about 225 miles, and greatest width ﬁfty, and in shape somewhat like an Indian arrow. “All the country lying north of Eaton." etc., is the western part of the

THE HIDDEN MORAL 69 territory to which the Indian title was extinguished in 1819. As this title was not extinguished when Brown and Michilimackinac counties were organ- ized, this diagonal line formed the south and east line in that part of the state, of the county last named. It is necessary to determine the early boundaries of towns and counties to consider these Indian treaties. I have tried to ﬁnd some good moral hid away under the ruins and name of this great old town, but save the lesson relative to the brevity of all sub- lunary things, I ﬁnd nothing fruitful for that purpose. But after all, I think I do see a good lesson for the young in the names'and lives of some of the old town ofﬁcials of Green. who for over ﬁfty years have survived their arduous labors. “'hen we see today Mr. Cross, the treasurer, Mr. Tibbits, the assessor and school commissioner, and Judge Warner, the commissioner of highways, hale and hearty in body and mind, enjoying their eighties, it does seem as though there was after all something of advantage in good, honest, temperate lives, that makes men respected and gives them fullness and ripeness of years. So to-night for myself, and I think I may also in your behalf, I extend to these survivors of the township oﬁicials of Green most hearty congratulations and best wishes for yet many years. And to the memory of the town of Green, 1 say: “HAIL AND FAREWELL!” (Although a. short address by Mr. Randall on the same subject was published in vol. 9, the one here given being much more extended, it was deemed advisable by the committee to insert it in vol. 10.——En.) THE EARLY HISTORY OF HORTICL'LTL'RE IN MICHIGAN BY J'. C. HOLMES. OF DETROIT [Read before the Michigan State Pomological $ociety at Battle Creek, February 25, 1873.]\ The many very large. rough. hardy pear trees. the many ancient apple orchards and old Morello cherry trees that we ﬁnd scattered along on the' old farms, on each side of the Detroit river, testify to us that the early settlers
Page 70
a 70 ANCIENT PEARS AND APPLES in that vicinity were not unmindful of the value to themselves and their posterity of the plantations of fruit trees. The heavy clay soil along the banks of the Detroit river seems admirably adapted to the growth, health and longevity of pear trees, if we may judge from the present condition of many of these old trees that rise to a height of sixty or seventy feet and bear large annual crops of very good pears, known only by the general cognomen of “Old French Pears," their origin running back beyond the knowledge of the oldest Frenchman of our time. Tradition says that some of the early French missionaries brought pear seeds, scions and trees from Normandy and planted a few around each little habitation along each side of the river from Monroe to Mt. Clemens. I have seen it stated that several'pear trees were brought from France in 1749 and planted along the river side from the Brush to the Witherell farm in Detroit, :1 distance of nearly one mile. How correct this statement is I do not know, but it seems to be a well ascertained fact that in no other locality in this country can such trees be found as the ancient pear trees that are now“ stand- ing on the banks of the Detroit river. It is not unusual for them to bear a crop of thirty or forty bushels each. A short time since Mr. William L. Woodbridge, of Detroit, told me that he had many times taken a crop of ﬁfty bushels from one of these old pear trees that stood on his father‘s farm. These old pear trees seem to be as hardy as the oaks of the forests; no dis- ease has ever attacked them; they ﬂourish under neglect about as well as does the Canada thistle. Very few of them receive much care, yet they bear their full annual crops as regularly as a well kept apple orchard. In many of the old apple orchards in the vicinity of Detroit we ﬁnd the Snow apple, the red and white Calville, the Detroit red, the Pomme Gris or grey apple, and the Rosseau. The late Gov. William Woodbridge owned a farm adjoining Detroit on the west; it is now annexed to and is a part of the city of Detroit. About the year 1825 Gov. Woodbridge bought of Grant Thorburn, of New York, two thousand apple trees and some pear trees and planted them on his farm, making two good orchards. He had the leading varieties of apples of that day, viz.: the Rhode Island Greening, the Baldwin, Yellow Belleﬂeur, White Belleﬂeur, Gloria Mandi, Spitzenburg, Roxbury Russet, Twenty Ounce apple, Fall Pippin, Early Harvest, Black Gilliﬂower, and many others. He also had the Snow apple. white and red Calville. Detroit red or black apple and .Pomme Gris or grey apple. The scions of the six varieties last named he procured from some of the old orchards in Windsor and Sandwich, Canada, opposite Detroit, and engrafted them into some of the trees that he bought of Mr. Thornburn. In other orchards in the vicinity of Detroit, where
Page 71
FRUIT RECORDS 71 these varieties of apples are grOwn, I ﬁnd that for the most part scions were taken from Canadian orchards near Detroit and engrafted into the oldvtrees. The farthest backthat I have been able to trace these apples toward their origin is to the year 1796. Some years since, as I was passing through the orchard of Mr. Francis Baby. of Windsor. Canada, for the purpose of getting specimens of apples for exhibition, I noticed a very handsome. bright red apple, at that date, Sep- tember, not ripe. Its'name Mr. Baby did not know. -Mr. James Dougall, son-in-law of Mr. Baby, and a near neighbor. who was well acquainted with the orchard, had never noticed this tree or its ‘fruit, so we concluded to wait until it was ripe. then take another look. A short time afterward I received from Mr. Dongall specimens of this fruit, accompanied by a note in which he says: “in. Baby informs me that he received the original trees, which are yet standing, and from which I took the specimens I send you, from Montreal, in 1796, along with other kinds, and he thinks it had no particular name, but says it is one of the Calvilles. Captain Cowan, who commanded a small vessel on the lakes, and who had formerly been a gardener to Gen. Washing- ton previous to his being president, brought up the trees in his vessel for Mr. Baby from Fort Erie, and as he was an excellent grafter, he took scions from each variety received by Mr. Baby for the purpose of engrafting them into trees in Detroit. I ﬁnd soine of the specimens of fruit are very good, while others from the same tree are very inferior. Some of the fruit is stained red to the core, and some specimens are white throughout. The specimens with stained ﬂesh are always the best. This remark holds good as against the red Calville and the Rosseau, which apples belong to the same class.” In the Baby orchard, among the trees brought from Montreal in 1796, were ‘ the Snow, Calville, Pomme Gris and other apples that were leading varieties in the orchards in Canada. I afterwards found this handsome but nameless apple in some of the orchards on Grosse Isle, under the name of Bourassa. The only work in which I ﬁnd the Bourassa apple mentioned is J. J. Thomas’ Fruit Culturist. The apple of which I am speaking does not correspond with his description. In an English fruit book, by William Forsyth, published in 1802, in his list of apples introduced into England from France, Iﬁnd mentioned Le Calville d’Automne, which, judging from Forsyth’s description, I think must be the nameless apple that I have alluded to. Besides this variety, he mentions the Pomme Gris, from Canada, and the red and the white Calville as being highly esteemed in England. The Snow apple, or Pomme de Neige, or Famense, known by all these names, is also mentioned by Forsyth. All the fruit books speak of it as a native of Canada, with one exception, viz.,
Page 72
72 ‘ EARLY NURSERIES Chauncey Goodrich, in his “Northern Fruit Culturist,” published in Burling- ton, Vermont. says: “This fruit is said to be a native of Montreal; we believe it was brought from France by the ﬁrst settlers of Canada. Wherever they went, either in Canada or the United States, they planted this apple.” In Hovey‘s Magazine of Horticulture for 1851, under the head of “Descrip- tions and Engravings of Select Varieties of Apples,” he says: “The Fameuse, though an apple of American origin, and known to most Euro- pean writers on fruit; from the time of Forsyth, does not appear to have been generally known to American pomological authors. Neither Thatcher or Cox, the earliest authorities, notice it; Mr. Kenrick was the ﬁrst to give a full account of it in his American Orchardist. That a variety of so much merit should not have been long since more extensively cultivated, is some- what surprising; for as an autumn apple, both on the score of beauty and excellence, it has few superiors.” Mr. William L. Woodbridge, son of Gov. Woodbridge, started a small nur- sery, mostly of pear trees, on his father‘s farm in 1833, when he was a school boy; with the help of one man7 and with the attention he could give it him- self, he was quite successful in raising trees. He raised many apples and pears from seed, some of them were very superior-in ﬂavor and beauty. He raised some trees from seeds of the Snow apple, the grain was ﬁner and the skin lighter colored than the true Snow apple, but the ﬂesh had the peculiar flavor and snowy whiteness of the parent. - In 1836 Mr. Woodbridge sold between three and four hundred pear trees from his nursery, to be taken to Chicago. Among them were the Seckel, Summer Bon (L‘hretian, French and English Jargonelle, Pound, Bartlett and White Doyenne. Mr. \Voodbridge thinks this was the ﬁrstlot of pear trees sold from a Detroit nursery, and that his was the only nursery in Detroit at that time, and it was not a. very extensive one. In the utumn of 1830, or thereabouts. Gov. Woodbridge bought in New York twenty thousand small trees and plants and had them shipped from Buffalo on a schooner for Detroit. On the way up the vessel stopped at Huron and was obliged to remain there till the next spring, being frozen in. When she arrived at Detroit the trees and plants were found to be dead; the whole lot being a total loss. - I ' One of the ﬁrst nurseries established in Michigan was that of E. D. and' Z. K. Lay. near Ypsilanti. A short time since, I addressed a note to Mr. E. I). Lay, who still resides on his farm at Ypsilanti, asking some questions with regard to his nursery, in answer to which I received the following: YPSILANTI, February 10, 1873. “SIR—At your request I send you an account of the nursery started and

VARIETIES OF FRUIT 73 carried on in the town of Ypsilanti, on the plains cast of the now city of Ypsilanti. ' in the spring of 1833} I came to Michigan. then a territory. to select a place for establishing a nursery, and selected the above location. In 'the fall of 1833 my brother. Z. K. Lay. and myself came to Ypsilanti and brought with us about twenty ﬁve thousand cultivated trees. mostly of one season‘s growth. from the nursery of Asa Rowe. near Rochester, New York. They consisted of one hundred and thirty varieties of apples, seventy ﬁve varieties of pears, forty of peaches. three of apricots, three of nectariues. twenty of cherries, twenty of plums, three of quinces. ﬁfteen of strawberries, forty of grapes, native and foreign, together with cur-rants, gooseherries, raspberries, &c., also a large assortment of ornamental shrubs, evergreens. roses, peonies, her- baceous, perennial ﬂowering plants. &c. ' In the autumn of 183-1 we erected a small greenhouse and ﬁlled it with plants. I think this was the ﬁrst greenhouse built in Michigan. In the autumn of 1836 we erected a larger greenhouse and ﬁlled it with a. choice collection of tropical plants. I do not know that there was any nursery of fruit trees in Michigan at the time we started ours on the plains, near Ypsilanti. The leading varieties of apples cultivated at that time were the Baldwin, Belleﬂeur, Tart Bough, Canada Red. Snow, Rhode Island Greening. Fall Pippin. Summer Pippin, Gree‘n Newton Pippin, Porter, Rambo, Golden Russet. Talniau‘s Sweet, Green Sweet. Iisopus Spitzenburg, Swaar and Twenty Ounce Apple. . The leading varieties of pears were the Bartlett, ’Bui’fum, White Doyenne, Flemish Beauty, Seckel and Stevens’ Genesee. Of peaches, the Early Anne. Sweetwater, Royal Kensington, Prince‘s Red » Rareripe, Orange, Pound, Barnard. Early York, Malta and Red Cheek Melocoton. . Apricots and nectarines we found were too tender for cultivation in this climate. I The principal varieties of cherries cultivated at that time were the Amber Heart. American Heart. Black Heart, Black Tartarian, May Duke. Ox Heart. Carnation. and White Tartarian. The plums were Coe‘s Golden Drop, Duane‘s Purple. .Green Gage, Bleeker‘s Gage, Huling’s Superb. Smith‘s Orleans, “'ashington, Yellow Gage. The persons making the ﬁrst and largest purchases of trees from the nur- sery, except in our immediate vicinity, were John Bertram. J. Henry. J. D. Pierce, Sidney Ketchum, George Ketchum. C. D. Smith. Isaac E. (,‘rary. and others of Marshall and vicinity. In the course of the ﬁrst ﬁve years of our 10 ‘
Page 74
74 FRUIT GROWERS nursery we sold trees that went to Lenawee, Hillsdale, Branch, St. Joseph, Kalamazoo, Jackson, Kent, Shiawassee, Genesee,, Oaklandh Livingston, Wayne and other counties in the state. There has been a decided improvement in the varieties of fruit since we started the Ypsilanti nursery, particularly in pears. A large number of the varieties we brought to Michigan proved to be worthless; so also with our collection of apples, a large number of the varieties proved to be unworthy of cultivation in this state. Of the-persons who started nurseries in Michigan between 1837 and 1840, I remember the names of Willis, of Battle Creek, Dunham near Kalamazoo, and White near Monroe. Most oi them closed their nurseries within a few years.” In 1841 George Foster started a small nursery in Detroit, on Michigan avenue, near Cass street, and in connection therewith a seed store on Jetter- son avenue, between Woodward avenue and Bates street. The nursery was called the Detroit Nursery. This arrangement continued but a year or two. In the autumn of 1842 William Adair and .George Foster entered into cOpartnership, and the ﬁrm held forth at what was known as the Michigan garden, located on Randolph street, between Lafayette and Croghan streets. on the Brush farm, Detroit. They dealt in fruit and ornamental trees and greenhouse plants. Mr. Foster soon retired from the ﬁrm and Mr. Adair has continued the business alone from that time to the present, not having a partner either in business or household affairs. His garden is now located where it has been for many years, on Jefferson avenue, corner of Adair street, near Bloody run. At an early day, about 1836. Mr. Charles Hastings started a nursery on his farm in Troy, Oakland county. After a time Mr. A. C. Hubbard became interested in this nursery and the ﬁrm was then Hastings and Hubbard. Sub- sequently Mr. B. M. Davis was admitted a member of the ﬁrm; then, for a short time, the ﬁrm was Hastings, Hubbard and Davis. After a few years, the health of Mr. Hastings having failed, he withdrew from the ﬁrm. Messrs. Hubbard and Davis purchased some land on the Porter farm, on what was then known as the Porter road in Springwells. That road is now known as 24th street, Detroit. They moved their nursery from Troy to this location, where it has remained ever since. Mr. Hubbard died in the autumn of 1871, leaving Mr. B. M. Davis the sole owner of the nursery. l The extensive greenhouses connected with this nursery are owned by Davis, Taplin & Co. Mr. Taplin was an employé of the late ﬁrm of Hubbard and Davis, but is now a partner with Mr. Davis. Mr. Davis has charge of the nursery and Mr. Taplin of the greenhouse.

FIRST HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY 75 Mr. T. W. Dunham had a nursry four and a half miles south of Kala- mazoo, as early as 1840. He called it the Kalamazoo nursery. In 1844, Gibson and Russell, at Jackson, had for sale fruit trees and shrub- bery from the Ypsilanti nursery. In 1844, Mr. S. B. Noble had a nursery in Ann Arbor, where he sold fruit trees and ornamental shrubbery. At about 1840, Mr. Willis started a nursery at Battle Creek. In the autumn of 1835 I passed through Battle Creek. About the only busi- ness going on at that place then was the building of a canal to lead the water from one river to the other so as to utilize it in the running of machinery. In 1840 Mr. White, familiarly known as Variety White, had a nurwry at Monroe. The ﬁrst horticultural society in Michigan of which I have any knowledge was partially organized at the Northern hotel, in Detroit, on the evening of March 5, 1846. At that meeting there were present, William Adair, John Ford, J. 0. Holmes, Thomas Hall, M. Howard Webster, John Lumsden, John B. Piquette, Robert Radford, Robert Stead and Henry D. Hastings. J. 0. Holmes was called to the chair and Henry D. Hastings appointed sec- retary. Having adopted a preamble and constitution and appointed a com- mittee to draft by-laws, the meeting adjourned to meet at Mechanics’ Hall on the evening of March 16th. On Monday evening, March 16th, the society met according to adjourn- ment. Permanent ofﬁcers were elected and by-laws adopted. The ofﬁcers elected were: Presiden t—John Winder. Vice-Presidents—John C. Holmes and Benjamin G. Stimson. Corresponding Secretary—M. Howard Webster. Recording Secretary—John Lumsden. Treasurer—Thomas Hall. The committees appointed were a follows: On Fruits—Adrian R. Terry, Wm. Adair, Samuel Barstow, George Dueld. ’ On Trees and Shrubs—George V. N. L0_throp, Lewis Hall, Bela Hubbard, John E. Schwarz. On Greenhouse Plants and Flori§t’s Flowers—John Ford, M. Howard W'ebster, John 0. Holmes, Wm. B. Wesson. On Ind/igfmous Plants—~Bela Hubbard, John B. Piquette, F. F. Merceron. O-n Vegetables—Thomas Hall, Robert Stead. Henry D. Hastings, Thomas 'W. Lockwood. The membership consisted of

For the purpose of showing what were the leading varieties of fruit under cultivation, and who were some of the fruit growers in and near Detroit at that time, I will give the names of some of the exhibitors and fruits exhibited in 1847. Among the varieties named you will probably recognize some that were long ago discarded and stricken from the list as unworthy of general cultivation in Michigan. At the society’s exhibition on August 21, 1847, Mr. Marvin Hannah. of Albion, exhibited Red Magnum Bonum, Blue Gage. Green Gage, Yellow Gage and Damson plums. Bela Hubbard of Springwells; French Jargonelle and Seedling pears, Imperial Gage and Blue Gage plums. A. C. Hubbard, of Troy; Orange Pippin and Seedling apples of 1846 and Bleeker’s Scarlet plums. J.

75 OFFICERS There were many other exhibitors, but the names of exhibitors and the kinds and varieties of fruits exhibited, already mentioned, will suiﬁce to show us what fruits were grown in the several localities and by whom they were raised. ' Many excellent varieties of fruit have been added to our list since that day. In addition to the names of exhibitors already given, there were at subse- quent exhibitions in other years, several persons who exhibited large collec- tions of apples, pears, peaches, plums and grapes. Among them I may men- tion E. D. Lay of Ypsilanti; O. M. Bronson, Waterford; B. G. Stimson, Detroit; Wm. B. Wesson, Detroit; A. Whitehead, Pontiac. Judge Barkery, Plymouth, made collections from the orchards in that town and entered them for exhibition in the names of the proprietors of the orchards. He took great interest in the welfare of the society, and was generally present at the exhibitions, bringing large collections of fruits from Plymouth gardens and orchards. At the annual meeting in March, 1848, the following oﬂicers were elected: President—J. C. Holmes. ‘ First Vice President—M. Howard Webster. SecOnd Vice President—W m. R. Noyes. Corresponding Sem-etary—Thos. W. Lockwood. Recording Secretary—Francis Raymond. Treasurer—Wm. B. W'esson. > At the annual meeting held in March, 1849, the ofﬁcers elected were: President—Rev. George Dnﬁield. First Vice President—Bela Hubbard. Second Vice President—B. M. Davis. Corresponding Secretary—E. R. Kearsley. Recording Secretary—Warren Isham. Treasurer—Wm. R. Noyes. At the annual meeting held in March, 1850, the following oﬂicers were elected: President—Rev. George Duﬂield. First Vice President—E. R. Kearsley. Second Vice President—B. M. Davis. Treasurer—Francis Raymond. Coresponding Secretary—H. Howard Webster. Recording Secretary—B. G. Stimson. The oﬂicers elected for 1851 were: President—B. G. Stimson. First Vice President—John Ford.

FLORA AND POMONA 79 Second Vice President—T. H. Hinchman. Treasurer—Francis Raymond. Recording Secretary—Bela Hubbard. Corresponding Secretary—Wm. Adair. Librarian—Bela Hubbard. The ofﬁcers elected for .1852 were: President—A. C. Hubbard. First Vice President—Thos. W. Lockwood. Second Vice President—Francis Raymond. Treasurer—Stephen Smith. Recording Secretary—Chas. Betts. Corresponding Secretary—Bela Hubbard. The interest in the society was well kept up until 1852. In that year there was a great falling off. There were four exhibitions in 1852, but they were very small compared with former years. At the annual meeting held in March, 1853, there were but few present, and the society then died out. As the society now here in session is a Pomological Society I have spoken only of the fruits exhibited by the Detroit Horticultural Society, thinking you would be more interested in the history of the fruit department than in the departments of ﬂowers and vegetables, and it would make my paper too lengthy to speak of all the departments of horticulture in detail; but our tables were always graced with an abundance of beautiful ﬂowers and excellent vegetables. Indigenous ﬂowers from our own ﬁelds and forests always held a conspicuous place in the shows. I think I do not like the name of Pomological Society as well as I do that of Horticultural Society, for the former designates only one department of horticulture, while the latter embraces every kind of horticultural product. 1 am found of delicious fruits; I am equally fond of beautiful ﬂowers; I love to see a well kept orchard, so also a well kept ﬂower and vegetable garden. I love to see the choicest products of each on exhibition by the same society, and an endeavor on the part of the society to foster the cultiva- tion and exhibition of the riches of Flora, as well as the riches of Pomona. 1 am glad to know that although this society makes the advancement of the pomological interests of the state its leading object, it does not ignore ﬂowers, but has a place for them in its premium lists. On the 9th day of September, 1853, a convention of nurserymen from the southern part of Michigan was held at Jonesville, Hillsdale county. The object of the meeting was to establish, as nearly as possible. uniform prices for fruit trees; also for the purpose of discussing such subjects connected

80 PRICES—CONSTITUTION with horticulture as might be deemed interesting and beneﬁcial, not only to nurseryinen, but to all the citizens of our State. A schedule of prices was reported to the convention, and, after some discussion, it was adopted. This meeting adjourned to meet at such time and place as the chairman and sec~ retary might decm ﬁt to appoint. ' ‘ In pursuance of this adjournment a convention of nurserymen and fruit growers was called and met at Adrian. Michigan, on the 24th of February. 1854. At this meeting the following gentlemen were present: B. W. Steere. Isaac Chase, A. G. Eastman, D. K. Underwood, and B, F. Strong, of Adrian; ("‘harles E. l’erigo. Toledo; John Merritt, Tecumseh; (‘. H. Hage- man, Blissfield; C. C. Cooley, Hudson; Haynes Johnson, Jr., Hillsdale; Jesse Manson, Pittsford; John T. Blois. Jonesville; J. 0. Holmes, Detroit; A. R. Bentley. Monroe. The meeting having been called to order, J. C. Holmes, of Detroit, was called to the chair, and J. T. Blois, of Jonesville, elected secretary. After the transaction of some business the following list of prices was reported. discussed and adopted: Resolved. That our price for apple trees of medium size. or from 5 to 7 feet high, shall be not less than 18} cents each, nor less than $16.00 per hundred. Extra sized trees at proportionate prices. Dwarf apple trees from 25 cents to 37,} cents each' Plum trees shall not be sold less than 50 cents each; our rice for peach trees shall not be less than 20 cents each, or $15.00 per hundred. Apricot and ectarine trees. on peach stocks, shall be from 371} to 50 cents each. Quince trees of medium size shall be from 25 to 50 cents each. Our price for hardy grapes, from two to three years old, shall not be less than 25 cents each. , The following constitution was then adopted: ARTICLE 1. This association shall be called The Michigan Nurserymen and Fruit Growers‘ Association. ARTICLE 2. Any practical nurseryman, fruit grower or friend of horticulture may, by a vote of the society, become a member. ARTICLE 3. The objects of the association shall be to extend the acquaintance of the mem- bers and to advance generally the horticultural interests of this and neighboring States. ARTICLE 4. The officers shall consist of a president. vice president, and a secretary, who shall also act as treasurer. They shall be elected by ballot. and hold their offices for one year. or until their successors shall be elected. They shall perform the duties usually devolving upon such ofﬁcers, and form an executive board. ARTICLE 5. The society shall hold annual meetings on the ﬁrst Tuesday in December, at which time the annual, election of officers shall be held. ARTICLE 6. By-laws not inconsistent with this constitution may be adopted, and from time to time altered and amended by a. majorit of the members present. ARTICLE 7. This constitution may be altered and amended at any annual meeting by a vote of two-thirds of the members present. The society adjourned to meet in Adrian the next June, but for some cause,

The subject of grape culture was discussed by Messrs. l’ilcher, Holmes, Steere and Perigo. In the evening the society met in the ofﬁce of T. M.- Cooley, now Judge ' Cooley. ‘ Specimens of several varieties of apples were presented for consideration by Messrs. Scott, Str0ng, Cooley, Eastman and others. The subject of apples being introduced, the discussion was participated in by Messrs. Underwood, Scott, Perigo, Blois, Perkins, Bort and Holmes. The subject of strawberries was discussed by Messrs. Underwood, Perigo, Bort, Scott, Strong, Steere and Cooley. The constitution of the society was amended by striking out in article 5. the words, “The ﬁrst Tuesday of December,” and inserting “The second Tuesday in January.” The following ofﬁcers were elected for the ensuing year: President—J. C. Holmes, Detroit. ' Vice President—J. E. Perigo, Toledo.- Sccretary and Treasurer—J. T. Blois, J onesville. The third annual meeting was held at Jackson on the 8th of January, 1856. The following gentlemen were elected members: 'J. E. Beebe. W. R. Gibson, J. T. Wilson, D. Cook, W'. T. Howell, R. Dunning. Doct. D. Foote. J. M. Harwood, M. McNaughton, Wm. Hayden, of Jackson; E.

82 DISCUSSIONS Corners, N. Y.; Ira C. and A. A. Olds, of Hartford. Van Buren Co., Mich. The schedule of prices of fruit trees was discussed, but no changes were made. Many specimens of apples were placed upon the tables by the mem- bers. ' On motion the question of separating seeds from the fruit, also the treat- ment of stock seedlings was discussed by Messrs. Blois, S'teere, Moody, Willson, Beebe, Dunning, Foote and Holmes. The question of pruning in the nursery was then discussed. At the evening session of the 9th of January, the examination of fruits on exhibition and the discussion of their respective merits, occupied the evening. Messrs. Cook, Moody, Holmes, Gibson and Blois were the principal speakers. At the morning session on the 10th of January, the pear and grape ques- tions were discussed by Messrs. Moody, Knapp, Beebe and Holmes. The association then proceeded to the election of ofﬁcers for the following year, with the following result: President—A. C. Hubbard, Detroit. Vice President—J. T. Blois, Jonesville. Secretary—W. R. Gibson, Jackson. The society then adjourned to meet at Jackson, on the 2d of September. On the 2d of September, 1856, the association met at Jackson. The presi‘ dent, Mr. Hubbard, being absent the chair was occupied by Mr. J. T. Blois, the vice president. The following gentlemen were elected members: S. B. Noble, James De I'uy, T. E. Gidley, H. T. Buck, P. B. Loomis and S. Gidley. A large collection of fruit was exhibited at this meeting The principal questions discussed during the session were the quality and the cultivation of several varieties of apple, pear, peach, strawberry and grape. The dis- cussions were participated in by Messrs. Foote, T. E. Gidley, Willson, Knapp, Bort, Noble, Blois and Steere. Another subject discussed was the frauds that had been practiced upon western nurserymen and amateurs by eastern venders of trees. The society then adjourned, and this was the last meeting it ever held. The Nurserymen and Fruit Growers’ Association having been winter killed, or from some other cause died out, there was a call from Clinton county, Kal- amazoo county and other places for a meeting to be held at Jackson for the purpose of organizing a state horticultural society. In September, 1857, pursuant to this call, a meeting was held at Jackson to form a state horticultural society. The meeting was called to order by Mr. K. Gibson of Jackson. On motion, T. T. Lyons of Plymouth was elected chairman and V. B. Merwin. of Moscow, secretary.

MICHIGAN STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY 83 A constitution and by-laws were adopted and the association organized as “The Michigan State Horticultural Society.” The following ofﬁcers were elected: President—Hezekiah G. Wells, of Kalamazoo. ‘ Secretary—R. F. Johnston, of Detroit. Treasurer—P. B. Loomis of Jackson. Directors—Hiram Walker, Detroit; D. W. Underwood, of Adrian; John_ T. Blois, Jonesville; Linus Cone, Troy; J. W. Nelson, Grand Rapids; Wm. Bort, Niles. After the reading of letters from persons who were unable to be present, the society adjourned. - The ﬁrst annual meeting of this society was held at Kalamazoo on the 7th of January, 1858, under. very favorable circumstances. There was a large attendance, and a good display of fruit. An extract from a Kalamazoo paper says: The display of fruit was large and most beautiful, one of the ﬁnest ever made in this State. Indeed .we are assured that, for excellence, beauty and variety, this collection surpassed the exhibit of the New York State Horticultural Society, made at Rochester last winter. Over one hundred different warieties of winter apple, raised in this State, were here exhibited, arranged tastefully on plates, and spread upon a double ‘row of tables. At 3 o'clock P. M. the meeting was called to order by the president. The secretary being absent, Mr. T. T. Lyon, of Plymouth, was elected secretary pro tem. The following ofﬁcers were elected for the ensuing year: President—H. G. Wells, of Kalamazoo. Vice Presidents—E. T. Graves, of Battle Creek, and B. W. Steel-e, of Adrian. . _ Secretary—T. T. Lyon, of Plymouth. Treasurer—Stephen S. Cobb, of Kalamazoo. The society continued in session three days, during which time considerable business was transacted. The President delivered an address upon the sub- ject of horticulture. Several committees were appointed to report upon various subjects connected with horticulture; reports that were made by these committees were discussed; a list of apples was recommended for gen- eral cultivation, and a list was made of apples that promise well; and a list that was, in the opinion of the society, unworthy of cultivation. Contributors of fruit were A. C. Hubbard, Detroit; Jeremiah Stanard, Ionia; Samuel Johnson, Kalamazoo; J. T. Willson, Jackson; D. McKee, W. Taylor, E. Merrill, George D. Rice, S. S. Cobb and A. Buel, of Kalama- zoo; Joshua Clemens, Leoni; B. Hathaway, L'ittle Prairie Ronde; and T. T. Lyon, Plymouth. I

S-i , TERMINATION OF THIS SOCIETY This society held an exhibition in Detroit on the 30th of June and lst of July, 1858. The specimens of horticultural products exhibited were excel- lent, but not so abundant as the ofﬁcers of the society had reason to expect, consequently there were but few visitors. The exhibition seems to have been almost an entire failure with regard to the number of articles exhibited and the number of visitors in attendance. I think this was the last effort the society made to hold an exhibition of horticultural products, or a meeting of any kind. It went the way of all the rest; it died out. In those early days of which I have spoken we had no trouble in ripening peaches and plums in Detroit, but the subsequent cold winters and the cur- culio have wrought some\vhat.of a change in that regard. _ Peach trees grow stronger, and I think they are more healthy and longer lived grown in a heavy, strong soil like that of Detroit than in light soils. I have never seen a case of the yellows there; sometimes, in a cold, wet; back~ ward spring. the leaves curl and fall off, but the trees soon recover from this. The borer is not so fond of working in peach trees grown in a heavy soil as it is in trees grown on a light soil. I have now spoken of some of the fruit trees of olden times and of hor- ticultural societies that have had their day and retired from the ﬁeld. This new Pomological Society seems to be doing a. good work; it is not only new, but it is strong, active, energetic. You and I are part and parcel of it. I hope it will be well sustained so that it may be able to accomplish the good it seeks to do. DETROIT THREE éCORE YEARS AGO LEADING MEN OF THE EMBRYONIC METROPOLIS OF MICHIGAN.

88 HISTORICAL ASSOCIATIONS HISTORICAL DETROIT HENRY A. FORD I. , An old town like Detroit seldom fails to present many historic sites and other points of special interest to the antiquary, or to any citizen or stranger of average intelligence. This city, from its age, its occupation by several nationalities at the different periods of its earlier history, and its character from the beginning as a military post, is peculiarly fortunate in .the number and interest of its historical associations. The central lower part of the city, for several blocks along and near the river, is replete with them. The plan has been mooted of marking, by inscription on metal plates or otherwise, after the fashion of old European cities, the more interesting of these locali ties; and the praiseworthy suggestion will doubtless materialize soon or late in the hands of a society formed for the purpose, or by private beneﬂcence. Meanwhile, in a brief series of papers devoted to our historic localities, we will do what we can to deepen the interest and heighten the pleasure of citizen or visitor, in his casual walks about the ancient burgh. Let us take position at the postol’ﬁce, and proceed thence. The observer here, or at the intersection of Congress and Woodward, isapt to notice with some surprise a phenomenon not common 'in river towns—that he is at the bottom of a long and gentle slope from the northward, corresponding to a similar rise of ground between him and the river. Obviously, he is in the bed of an old-time stream—in this case the Savoyard river (more anciently the Rigolet des Hurons), named from a native of Savoy. who had a pottery upon its banks in the early days. This brook—for it should hardly be dig-' niﬁed as a river—took its rise several blocks east of Woodward avenue in a willow swamp on the Guoin farm. near the present meeting of Riopelle and East Congress streets. It flowed in an irregular course near the line of Fort street east, crossed “'oodward avenue at Congress, where it was spanned by a rude wooden bridge, and thence ran in general parallelism to the Detroit, which it entered at about Fourth and Woodbﬁdge, in a bay which then I

STE. ANNE’S CHURCH—CASS FARM 89 stretched along the fronts- of several of the old farms. It was bordered by rather narrow belts of low, marshy ground, upon one of which, the southern, the postoﬂice now stands. Within a little distance to the west and south, on the higher bank back of the pickets of the old fort, stood a lofty oak whose hol- low trunk held an image of the Virgin, and which was said to mark the spot where Father Constantin del Halle, founder of the church of Ste. Anne perished during an Indian attack in 1705. So the legend goes at least. Setting our faces toward the river, and walking down to the corner of Griswold and Jefferson, we are directly upon the primitive French settle- ment about Fort Pontchartrain. In a little cove-at the foot of Griswold, Cadillac landed with his queerly costumed band of soldiers and colonists. July 24, 1701. ‘The hamlet he commenced was built upon the contracted plan of old world towns, so that within the 120 feet that measure the breadth ~ of Jefferson avenue were comprised two French streets and the little blocks of dwellings between them. The ﬁre of 1805 swept them all away, and the last of their immediate successors, the famous Campau house, disappeared a few years ago from the site, No. 140 Jefferson avenue, now occupied by the stately Palms building. Mr. Campau is said to have built upon or very near the ground occupied by Cadilac’s headquarters. Between this and the south- west corner of Griswold, upon the north side of the old Ste. Anne’s street. of 15 feet width, and within 20 feet of the present south line of Jeﬁerson. stood the later Ste. Anne’s church, built in 1723 of logs, with two modest, spires and two bells. It followed its predecessors in a ﬁery ordeal; and its successor upon the same site, built in 1755, was burned in the ﬁre of 1805, but men are still alive who can remember the ruins that long marked the spot. The ﬁrst Catholic cemetery in Detroit adjoined the church directly in the modern avenue. All burials previous to 1723 were probably in the military cemetery, just back of the First National Bank. Still tanding upon Jefferson avenue and looking westward to the inter- section of Second, one could formerly have seen the sparkling waters of the Detroit, as they here came up to the high bank that formed the front of the Cass farm. In those days the river margins of the Cass. Jones, Forsyth. Labrosse, Baker and \Voodbridge farms abutted on a beautiful though not deep bay, long since destroyed by the ﬁlling and “made ground” which began with the improvement of the Cass farm for residence and business. The banks were high with a good road near the brink, and furnished a favor- ite promenade and driveway to the Detroiters of bygone generations. The solid little building used by the First National Bank has an interest of its own. having been erected in 1836, the “wildcat” days. for the bank of Michigan. It was bought by the United States in December. 1842, for 12

‘90 FORT PONTCHARTRAIN $32,000, and long used for the postot'ﬁce and federal court house. It stands as is well knoWn, upon the site of the east gate of the stockade about Fort Pontchartrain, which acquired special renown as the “Pontiac gate" after the failure of the treacherous Indian attempt in 1763. From this gateway. 0n the 31st of July in that year. marched the red coats under Capt. Dalzell to the massacre at Bloody Brook, and through it ﬂed back the remnants of that ill starred band after their terrible repulse. The stockade of 1807, built by Gen. Hull, extended far beyond this, reaching from the Cass to the Brush farm near the Biddle house, and from the fort on the second terrace. wh‘ose site is now crossed by Fort street, to the river. It had gates and block houses 1 on each side on the line of Jefferson avenue. Walking down Griswold street from the bank corner, we have on our right the site of the “King’s palace” and garden, names which mark the later. English regime, when the palace or ofﬁcial residence was built for Gov. Hamilton, the “Hair-buyer General,” as George Rogers Clarke designated him in the Vincennes campaign of 1778, from his oﬁ'er of premiums for scalps of American patriots. The site is now partly covered by the ﬁne buildings on the south side of Jefferson avenue. Turning westward on Woodbridge, we are at once upon the historic ground where the beginnings of Detroit were made. Somewhere here, upon a site that can not now be precisely identiﬁed, was the ﬁrst Ste. Anne’s church, pioust commenced only two days after the landing. Nor are the exact limits of Fort Pontchartrain probably now to be deﬁned. Mr. Farmer. in his “History of Detroit,” says that this ﬁrst of the Detroit military works stood between JeﬂFerson and Woodbridge, on the west half of the block between Griswold and Shelby, probably crossing Shelby and occupying a part of the ground now covered by the Michigan Exchange. In 1760-61 the tract con- tained within the stockade reachedjrom the present'line of Griswold to 50 feet west of Shelby, and from the alley between Larned and Jefferson to “’oodbridge. Twenty eight years later, in Revolutionary times, when the citadel was at the corner of Jefferson and Wayne, and just before the Fort Lernoult (afterwards Shelby) was built, all the ground between Griswold and Cass, Larned and the river, was included. The original fort—a rude log aﬁair, ‘but strong enough for itspurpose—was about 200 feet square. About 1858 the stumps of some of the cedar pickets enclosing it were found by workmen making excavations in ,the rear of the Michigan Exchange. The council house stood near the river, between Griswold and Shelby.- II. The close of the ﬁrst article of this series left our pedestrian upon the site

OLD BUILDINGS—HISTORIC NAMES 91 of old Fort Pontchartrain and the original French settlement, about the intersection of West Woodbridgc and Shelby streets. Near this spot stood the ﬁrst building occupied (1838) by a public free school in this city. It was a plain two story frame, 40 by 80 feet, not built for the purpose, and having a convenient grocery in the ﬁrst story, with outside stairs leading to the school room in the second. The house was erected on piles, upon the primi- tive river bank, a site now just east of the old Board of Trade building, on “'oodbridge treet. Passing along that street to the corner of Wayne, we are upon ground where once were the waters spanned by the narrow plank road or causeway leading out to the ﬁrst dock pushed from the adjacent shore into the Detroit—a small and very simple affair, on light piles, and composed of timber, logs, and loose stones. With the increase of commerce and the advent of steamers, new and more substantial wharves were constructed, and this was suffered to fall into decay. The space it occupied, and more in the vicinity, was transformed into “made ground” many years ago by the enormous ﬁlling of 25,000 cubic yards of earth. In the new volume of Mr. Parkman, “Montcalm and Wolfe,” an extract is made from the narrative of Father Bonnecamp, chaplain to the expedition of Celoron to the valley of the Ohio in 1751. He was here for a day, on his return from the expedition. and records that “the situation is charming. A ﬁne river ﬂows at the foot of the fortiﬁcations,” which, as we have seen, extended but little below Woodbridge. From this point, or a few rods beyond. the river trenched rapidly upon the present shore. forming the beautiful bay mentioned in our ﬁrst number, which was skirted by a high bank. At First and Second streets the waters encroached upon the line of Jeﬁ'erson avenue; and north of it, in a superb site upon the bank. stood the old Cadillac or Cass house. destroyed in 1882, which had to be moved but a short distance to reach its ﬁnal resting place on Larned street. The name given to Jetferson avenue, like so many others—would there were more—in the city, is itself historic. It is one of ﬁve Presidential names given to our principal avenues by the governor and judges of Michigan ter- ritory, in their replatting ot' the town after the sweeping ﬁre of 1805—Wash- ington, Jefferson, Adams, Madison and Monroe. It begins with the entrance of Woodbridge at First street. Starting from the ancient shore of the Detroit at this point, and now facing eastward, we pass. presently the location of the citadel or arsenal at the northwest corner of Jefferson and Wayne. con- nected with Fort Shelby by a covered way. The house of the military storekeeper, for a long time Capt. Perkins. was a small frame a little below. on the avenue, where Mrs. Perkins became as noted for the floral beauty of her front yard. as her husband for the neatness of his buildings and

9‘2 HISTORIC SITES grounds, with their piles of ordnance, shot, and shell. Between Wayne and Cass stood one of the old time block houses, on the line of the Hull stock- ade, the last one built; and, after the ﬁre of 1805 this was used as the public jail. At the northwest corner of Jefferson and Cass stood the dwelling of Judge May, built of stone from the chimneys left by the ﬁre. This 'suc- ceeded the block house in use as a. jail, but by 1815 it was abandoned for an' old wooden building on the same side of the avenue a little beyond Shelby“ The May residence was enlarged and became the excellent and widely reputed hostelry known for many years as the Mansion house. A small frame part of it, removed to another part of the city, was in existence only seven or eight years ago. On the opposite, the northwest corner, in the old Newberry build- ing, afterwards the Garrison house, was the ﬁrst telegraph ofﬁce opened in the city, for the Speed line, some time in the 40’s. At Jefferson and W'ayne the blutfy bank was ﬁnely utilized by Lieutenant Anderson for the placing of his 24-pounders, August 16, 1812, to resist the advance of Brock‘s force from Springwells; but the cowardice of Hull pre- vented the etfective resistance he had planned. Passing now rapidly the former site of Ste. Anne's church in the avenue. between Shelby and Griswold; of the Campau house of 1805, at No. 140, with Cadillac‘s headquarter's site thereon not far away, and of the guard- house and east or ‘fPontiac" gate of the old fort, where the First National Bank now stands. we come in a block further to the crossing of Woodward avenue, just below which. in Woodward, long stood the primitive market- house of the city. One of the old Godfroy homesteads stood opposite to the eastward, on Woodward and Woodbridge. The police station on the latter street stands upon the exact site of the Godfroy barn.‘ At Jefferson and Randolph, where Fireman’s hall now stands, was the government council house of the later dominations, opposite the notable two story brick residence—the only one in town when built—of Gov. Hull, on the Biddle house corner. Looking down to the northwest corner of Wood- bridge and Randolph. we see another of the old time hotel sites, where VVoodworth kept an inn as far back as 1812, and where his famous Steamboat hotel long ﬂourished. At the foot of Randolph were the original city water works. on the Berthelet wharf, with the reservoir in rear of the Fireman’s hall. The last relics of the latter water works, with the well remembered round tower. have but lately disappeared from the foot of Orleans. At or near Brush street ran the east front of Hull’s stockade. with a gate and block house here. The old church at the corner of Benubien, occupied as a carriage factory and warehouse, Was the First Congregational, built in 1845. Next beyond St. Antoine, on the south side, is a noticeable row of old

OLD LANDMARKS 93 dwellings, dating back to the 30’s and 40’s. \ A number of venerable mansions remain on ,the avenue, though most of them are much changed by modern reconstructions. The oldest are probably the Trowbridge house, at No. 494, built about 1826, and the Brush homestead at 462. put up in ’28, and recon- structed in ’70. Part of the Van Dyke house, at No. 308, was built in 1836; and the Moran residence, 393, is also an old one. But would you see the older Moran home, the most venerable building in Michigan? Drop down from Jefferson on Hastings one short square, turn to the right a few steps, and there, at No. 182 and 184 Woodbridge east, half hidden behind a. wilder- ness of weeds and with one or two of the ancient pear trees still towering above it, is the ruinous old building of 1734, wherein the late Judge Charles Moran was born. ' I Returning to Jefferson avenue, little of historic interest, save an old man- sion here and there, presents itself until the Pontiac tree is reached, in the valley of Bloody brook. the last visible memorial of the Indian massacre here wreaked by the great Ottawa chief and his painted braves upon the English troops, July 31, 1763. Alas! that is no longer a surviving memorial. Its partial decay was observed last year, and this spring it totally refused to put forth buds and leaves. Its wood is already beginning to be worked up into souvenirs. A few rods below, upon ground now deeply covered, stood one of the early mills, whose ruins, Judge Campbell says, could still be seen forty to ﬁfty years ago. In Mount Elliott cemetery, a little off the avenue, the grave of Major Hamtramck may be visited, and a mile or so beyond, near the river, at the southeast corner of the Wesson place, with a grand old elm still dominating it, may be seen the quaint little dwelling built for him by one of the Chapo- tons in 1802, and where “The Frog on Horseback,” as Hamtramck was called from his small size and singular appearance when riding. died the next year. Upon the site of the present water works until lately stood one of the last. of the old French dwellings, known as the Van Avery “or Chauvin house. It was built by Thomas Stewart and Jean Limarre, in 1769, with a solidity and honesty that never failed to command the admiration ‘of visitors. The 'great pear trees near it, planted in 1790, were known as the “Twelve Apostles.” The traveler thence to Grosse Pointe will pass the scene of the terrible battle in which an Indian tribe was almost annihilated in 1712, at Presque Isle, now Windmill Point, and will ﬁnd some old habitations at Grosse Pointe and about L’Anse Creuse. the little bay beyond. q

94 ° ' OLD LANDMARKS ‘ III. ' The saunter along Jeﬂ'erson avenue brought us to one or two points of an- tiquarian interest at the crossing of Woodward. Only a square below this, at the southwest corner of Woodbridge and Woodward, opposite the Mariner‘s church, is the ﬁrst known site of the Detroit postoﬂice, where Judge Abbott, who held the postmas'tership from 1806 to 1831, dispensed for many years the hatfuls of letters and papers that made up the mail for the settle- ment. The ofﬁce afterwards occupied the ﬁrst ﬂoor of a building on the Mariner's church corner. A few rods below this and seventy seven feet above Atwater street, was the margin of the river in the days preceding the im- provements along a few blocks of the city front. Walk now two squares up Woodward, turn to the right on Larnard one block, and view with reverent regard the oldest church building, by far, left standing in the city, and still occupied for religious purposes." The present Ste. Anne's church, at least the fourth or ﬁfth of the name in Detroit, is lineal descendant of the little log-and-bark building whose erection was begun by Cadillac’s people within the stockade about Fort Pontchartrain the second day after landing. The venerable stone pile at Larnard and Bates was com- menced in 1817, but not ﬁnished till 1832, though occupied long before. The devoted Father Richard, whose statue appears on the east front of the city hall, contributed his entire pay as delegate in Congress towards its build- ing. A Catholic cemetery of an acre’s size was located here in 1797, and in it the remains of Colonel Hamtramck ﬁrst reposed. Along here, between Bates and Randolph, Larned and Michigan Grand (now Cadillac Square), the ground was perhaps ﬁfty feet above the general level, forming the orig- inal “Piety Hill,” a name since appropriated for .a locality far up town, near Cass park. - A little north of Ste. Anne’s, on the west side-of Bates, near Congress, was the ﬁrst building, a very plain affair of twenty four by ﬁfty feet, occupied by the University of Michigan in 1817, and for a few, years thereafter. Passing on to the southwest corner of Randolph we are upon the site of the original Ste. Marie’s hospital, opened by the Sisters of Charity, June 9, 1845, in a much older log cabin; and, looking down to the northwest corner of Jef- ferson and Randolph, we may see in our mind’s eye the little one story brick building which held the Detroit bank as long ago as 1806. Facing now westward on Larned, our pedestrian may go on to Wayne, where, at the northeast corner, ﬂourished the Washington market from 1835 ' to 1852. At Nos. 164 and 166, between First and Second streets, stood, until * Ste. Anne’s was demolished in the early summer of 1886.

OTHER POINTS OF INTEREST 95 August, 1882, the strongly built frame dwelling which tradition affirmed to have been erected on the banks of the Detroit. then but a little way to the southward, by' Cadillac, for the chief of the Hurons, one hundred and seventy nine years before. The whole ancie'nt part of it, with its massive oak and pine beams and sills, was in admirable condition when torn down to make way for the present brick buildings. _ Returning to Woodward and pausing on the west side of the aveune, we face the ﬁrst church row, and the only one ever erected in Detroit. On the northeast corner stood the original Presbyterian church ediﬁce, a rather stately one for its time, as may be seen by the picture of its burning, now hanging on the east wall of the public library. Next and north of it was a little building of brick, occupied for a session room; beyond that the ﬁrst St. Paul‘s Episcopal church; and ﬁnally, on the other side of Congress, the Methodist meeting-house of a generation ago. At an earlier day the Pro- testant cemetery of the petty hamlet here included a part of the avenue in this locality, between Larned and Congress. Above this, to the city limit, Woodward avenue presents little of historic interest. It is worthy of notice, however, how closely the First Methodist church has clung to this avenue. lts next building, torn down but a year or two since, stood on the southwest corner of State and Woodward. and the superb ediﬁce now occupied is just beyond the Grand Circus at Woodward and Adams. The original building occupied by this society, but never dedicated, I believe, was put up in 1834, only two squares west of Woodward. and was abandoned _ because it was so far out “on the commons,” and difﬁcult to reach in bad weather. It is now occupied as a dwelling, at the southwest corner of Gratiot and Farrar. 0n the ﬂat-iron lot close by, upon which is the public library, long stood the county jail, which was succeeded by the Clinton street prison. Opposite it, on the site of the First Presbyterian church, was erected the gallows for the execution of the Indian, Kishkaukon, who defeated its pur- pose by suicide in his cell. At Farmer and Gratiot stood the old Pontiac depot, removed in 1842 from the site of the ﬁrst railway station in the city, at Dequindre and Jefferson where it was established in 1838. About 1850 the cars coming down Gratiot avenue stepped upon the opera house site, on the Campus Martins, which was ﬁnally abandoned for the Brush street depot. The Central depot, for the ten years 1838-48, was on the-site of the city hall, the trains moving in and out on Michigan avenue. ' Fort street, historically, is one 'of the most interesting of Detroit thorough- fares, as its very name suggests. Near its western terminus, on the river bank, may be visited a well preserved. though small, enclosure or fortiﬁcation of the mound-builders. L'pon and near the ground now covered by Fort Wayne
Page 96
96 THE FORT were the copious natural fountains or springs that gave the name to Spring- wells; and, in the vicinity, several interesting burial mounds could be seen forty or ﬁfty years ago. Hereabout were pitched the wigwams of the Pottawa- tomie village, whose site was granted by the tribe to Robert Navarre, “son of the scrivener,” one of the most notable of the early French residents. The Huron village was on the Jones farm, now a long way within the city limits. Xot far from Twenty fourth street ran Knagg’s creek, at the mouth of which, on the Detroit, stood his old red windmill, erected in or before 1795, and remaining until this century was well advanced. The late Mrs. Hamlin made it the scene of one of her entertaining “Legends of Le Detroit.” From this shore it is worth 'while to cast a glance across to the spire of the Sandwich church, marking the site of the Huron mission removed thither by Father Potier in 1747, upon the enforced abandonment of the mission on Bois Blane island. At Fort and Fourteenth streets, on the northwest corner, may be observed with some interest the venerable Piquette house, occupied in 1874 as the Little Sisters’ Home for aged poor. Three squares beyond, at the railway crossings, some traces are left of the banks of Campan’s Mill river, later Cabacier’s and ﬁnally May‘s creek, which entered the Detroit not far from the Central depot. The mill—a maulin banal, or public mill, in the earliest times, for grinding grain—stood at this crosing. Precisely at Cass street we strike the west line of the military cantonment attached to Fort Shelby in 1815, and at Wayne the boundary of the fort itself. This was built in 1778 by the British troops under their commandant here from whom it was origi- nally named Fort Lernoult, and extended from Wayne to a line about half way between Shelby and Griswold, and from Lafayette nearly to Congress street, the glacis running well down to the bank of the Savoyard river. Dur- ing the war of 1812-15 its name was changed to Fort Shelby, in honor of the gallant governor of Kentucky, who personally led his troops at the bat- tle of the Thames. Fort and Shelby streets, of course, derive their names from it. The stump of the ﬂagstaﬂ", a well kept fragment of Norway pine, now in the public library, was dug up a few years ago, during excavations for the cellar at the residence of the Hon. John Owen, No. 61 Fort street west. The military cemetery was a little to the northwest, between Lafay- ette and Michigan avenues. Another fortiﬁcation, but a petty circular affair of about forty feet diam- eter, with a parapet ten feet high, was thrown up in 1806, in consequence of an Indian scare, far out in the woods, near the northeast corner of Park and High streets. and was called Fort Croghan, sometimes Fort Nonsense. At the crossing of Fort and Griswold, on the northwest corner, one may

DETROIT IN 1838 97 recognize the old First Baptist church, now occupied for business purposes, Looking up Griswold we see the old Territorial and ﬁrst State Capitol of Michigan on State street, reconstructed to its present shape as the high school building in 1875, three years after the city hall was ﬁnished. Not far to the northwest of this, at No. 43 West Park, near Grand River, stood the ﬁrst building erected by the Detroit school board—a small wooden aﬂ’air costing $540. Pushing several blocks out on Fort street east, between Rivard and Russell, on the south side at No. 253, is the plain frame dwelling in which the young Lieut. Ulysses S. Grant resided when stationed in Detroit, away back in the 40’s. Returning by Congress street, the house No. 185, between Hastings and St. Antoine, may attract attention as the place of meeting between John Brown of Osawatomie and some of his Detroit sympathizers, Dec. 12, 1859, before he made his ill starred attempt at Harper’s Ferry. At the corner of Beaubien is one of the old Beaubien homesteads, to the rear of which was removed, from the site of Charles Busch‘s hardware store, the Dr. Brown house, one of those built next after the ﬁre of 1805. If the wanderer cares now to walk far enough up St. Antoine to reach Elizabeth, he will ﬁnd on the northwest corner another of the ancient Beaubien houses,'now occupied by the House of Providence. Farmer’s “History of Detroit” has been the chief source of information for these papers, although free use has been made of Roberts’ “sketches,” Mrs. Hamlin’s “Legends” and many other publications—The Detroit News. DETROIT IN 1838 BY HENRY. A. FORD Materials for the study of Detroit ﬁfty years ago do not abound, except in the memories of a few living men. The directory system had yet reached scarcely any of the infant cities west of the Alleghanies; and the paucity and brevity of local sketches in the newspapers of those days afford but narrow 13

98 STATISTICAL ﬁelds for investigation. Happily about the time when the ﬁrst tentative efforts Were made to transform Michigan from a territory to a full ﬂedged state, it entered the intelligent brain of Mr. John T. Blois, teacher of the Detroit Latin and English school, to compile a gazetteer of the incoming commonwealth, as a source of accurate information at home and a guide to immigrants from abroad. The result appeared early in 1839, in a neat 16 mo. volume of 418 pages, apparently printed in New York, and published there by Robinson, Pratt & Co., in Detroit by Messrs. Sydney L. Rood & Co. A few copies of this, in the original covers of ﬁgured blue cloth, still exist, and are unique and invaluable relics of the early days of Michigan as a separate state. Mr. Blois brings his statistics and other data, so nearly as he can, down to October, 1838. The state had then provided for thirty nine counties, of which Arenac (but recently organized), Barry, Sanilac, Gratiot, Montcalm, Isabella, Clinton, Gladwin, Oceana and Midland were as yet unorganized. It was mak¥ ing rapid progress, however, and the legislature. which was then charged with such business, had provided at its last session for the erection of seventy two townships. The population, at the close of 1837, numbered 175,000 (besides 7,914 Indians), against 87,278 in 1834 and 32,538 in 1830. There were but two chartered cities—Detroit and Monroe—and twenty three incorporated villages. Of'the 56,451 square miles of territory only 25,636 had been sur- veyed, and the Indian title to at least two thirds of the upper peninsula had not yet been extinguished. The northern part of that region was still some- times called “the Siberia of Michigan.” But in that and other portions of the state a geological survey under the lamented Dr. Douglass Houghton was progressing with excellent results, under an appropriation for three years of . $12,000 per annum. The public lands were being sold at government ofﬁces in Detroit, Monroe, Kalamazoo, Flint and Ionia. The era of wild specula- tion was not yet over, and under the new banking law of the state forty ﬁve wildcat banks had been started between Aug. 15, 1837, and April 3, 1838, when an alarmed legislature put a stop to inﬂation of this kind. Fifteen banks were already existing under older laws, and altogether had a. nominal capital of more than $10,000,000. Twenty four railroads, with a total length of 1,011 miles, had received special charters. and three or four others, aggre- gating 591 miles, were provided for under the internal improvement system of the state, which likewise contemplated several canals and sundry river improvement. Five state roads or turnpikes had been made, all pushing out from Detroit. and one of them, the Chicago road, being 254 miles long. The whole state had but sixty eight mail routes, only three of these directly reaching Detroit. The larger lake steamers, of 250 to 472 tons, numbered
Page 99
STATISTICAL—DETROIT THE CAPITAL 99 but nineteen, and the .largest yet launched upon these inland seas was the “Illinois,” of 7 55 tons, built here. The entire tonnage owned in the Detroit district in 1837 was but 6,994, against 995 in 1830. The industries of the State were as yet light and comparatively unimport- ant. The estimated value of the agricultural product of 1837, based in part upon the census of that year, gave $2,114,366 for 1,691,499 bushels of wheat; $1,163,446 for oats; $1,319,045 for corn and $36,573 for rye; making a total of 84,633,430. Neat stock was estimated at $4,480,500; horses, $1,405.- 800; hogs, $1,636,425; sheep, 895,515; total, $7,617,240. Mining had hardly yet begun. The Clinton salt works were going; Mt. Clemens had a glass factory and was doing a little ship building. Incomplete census returns in November, 1837, exhibited 433 saw mills, 114 grist mills, 23 carding machines, 12 cloth dressing establishments and 16 distilleries. The vast in- dustrial development of Michigan was yet mainly in the future. Wayne county at this time had 23,400 people, being little more populous-I than Washtenaw with 21,817 and Oakland with 20,163; but apart fI‘OIlli Lenawee, which had 14,540, it had more than twice as many as any other in: V the state. Its only villages were “Dearbornville,” which had about sixty families and the United States arsenal, just completed; Plymouth (or “Plymouth Corners”), about 300 population; Northville and Flat Rock, about 250 each; Redford “small,” and Gibraltar, ﬁfteen to twenty families. Detroit had yet no suburb of Springwells, except as a farming settlement, and Hamtramck is set down as “three miles” from the city.' The Central rail- road was running across the country as far as Ypsilanti; the “Pontiac road” was in operation to Royal Oak, and the “railroad to Shelby” was in course of construction. The depot was upon the Campus Martins, where the opera house now stands. The county sent two senators and seven representatives to the state legislature. Detroit was in 1838 not only “port of entry” and “seat of justice for “'ayne county,” but also “capital of the state of Michigan.” The state house, otherwise the county court house, now built around by the high school building, is named as a “commodious ediﬁce of brick, constructed in the Ionic order 90 feet by 60. The portico in front is supported by six columns and the entablature at the sides by pilasters. The steeple, crowned with a dome, is 140 feet high.” The view from this was thought to be exceeded by but two others in the country, those from the state house in Boston and from St. Michael’s church in Charleston. On the 1st of January of that year the place had a population of 9,278 against 4,968 in 1834, 2,222 in 1830, 1,517 in- 1828, 1,442 in 1826, 1,110 in 1820, and 770 in 1810. Thus within a decade the population had once increased by 50 per cent, had once more than
Page 100
100 BUSINESS—PUBLIC BUILDINGS doubled, and again nearly doubled. With very few exceptions all lived below the Grand Circus, and along not more than a mile’s front upon the river, “more or less densely settled.” Most of the business was done on Jefferson avenue, but Woodward avenue was “becoming of increased importance." Atwater, “upon the river,” and Woodbridge, “running parallel with it upon the declivity,” were “mostly occupied by-stores and dealers in the heavier articles of merchandise.” There were 4 banks with $2,250,000 capital, 27 dry goods, 25 grocery and provision, 14 hardware, 10 forwarding and commis- sion, 8 drug. 7 clothing and 3 book stores, 8 silversmiths and jewelers, 27 law- yers, 22 physicians. 3 markets, 4 printing ofﬁces, issuing 4 weeklies (1 religious), 3 dailies, 1 tri-weekly and 1 educational monthly. The little city had also a Mechanics' hall, a theater, museum. circus, public garden, and a number of federal and state ofﬁces. In manufacturing there were 3 iron foundries, 1 brass foundry, 2 breweries, an edge-stool and a sash factory, and _ “a large steam saw mill.” Much wholesale trade was already done, one half Ito three ﬁfths of all merchandise sold going to the interior. No great amount of any product was exported, except ﬁsh. The fur trade had declined, although the American Fur company still kept its agency here. Forty seven lake vessels'of all kinds were owned in this city, with an aggregate tonnage of 5,164. For their accommodation 5,900 feet. of wharf had been made. About three steamers and as many sail vessels arrived and departed daily. The steam ferry to the Canada shore was running. Western emigration pass- ing through afforded a large source of proﬁt, especially in the season of navi- gation. I The town was quite well and modernly built, nearly all the huts and cottages of the French period having disappeared. Wooden buildings were much the more numerous; and as many of them occupied leased grounds. the sight of houses in process of removal was more common than now. The business quarter had several ﬁne brick blocks and the city had “altogether a cheerful and comely appearance,” with “not a few outward indications of high cultivated taste and reﬁnement.” The principal public buildings, besides the state house or capitol, included the city hall on the Campus, a $20,000 brick structure, 100 feet by 50, with two stories and a basement, the lower story occupied for a market; St. Paul‘s church, brick, with a 115 foot tower; the Baptist church, a plain affair at the corner of Fort and Griswold; St. Anne’s, still standing on Larned street, but then its two spires were “in front,” and were backed by an octagonal dome 30 feet high; and the old Bank of Michigan building, costing $40,000. There were eight church societies, two Catholic. one colored. and one each of Epicopalians, Presby- terians, Methodists, Baptists, and German Lutherans, The Catholics had

SCHOOLS—“’ATER WORKS 101 one and the Protestants another orphan asylum, the latter in “a handsome two story brick ediﬁce,” on the familiar site then “a mile and a half above the city.” The public schools of the place were grouped in seven districts which together had 4,355 children of school age. A branch of the state university was located here. Three free schools were maintained by the ladies’ free school society (Protestant), specially for indigent children, who were furnished books and all needed supplies; and others were the St. Clare English and German (Catholic) and the French female charity schools. The chief private schools were the Detroit female seminary, in care of Prof. and Mrs. Wilson; the young ladies’ institute, conducted by Mrs. Hector Scott and her daughters;'St. Clare’s seminary and several schools for boys, taught by Profs. Blois, Mitchell and Bacon. The state library, kept at the capitol, already numbered 1,900 volumes; the Detroit young men’s society had made a good beginning with 1,200; and there was also a circulating library of about 1,000. The society named had been in existence for six years, the historical society for about ten, the state literary institute was organized the same year, and several other organizations of the kind had been made here. The system of water supply demands a passing notice in closing. Steam power, forcing water from the river, was giving but partial service, and a plan had been mooted to utilize the current of the stream in generating a power for further use. This had been superseded, however, by the works - which stood until a_ quite recent day at the foot of Orleans street, where the tall chimney may still be seen. This was then “the upper part of the city,” and a brick tower was here being erected, sixty fo'ur feet in diameter and going to a height of ﬁfty feet above the river, supporting a cast iron reservoir twenty feet deep, with a capacity of 425,000 gallons. Water was to be taken 450 feet from the shore and 6 feet below the surface of the river, through a 12 inch pipe. A 25 horse power engine would do all the work. One hundred ﬁre hydrants were to be connected, each capable of throwing a stream into the third story of any building in the city. The cost of this modest system was estimated at $100,000 and it was to be ﬁnished in 1839. The sewerage of the city was already pretty good; but the streets were mostly in primitive condition. and bad in the spring and after hard rains. Paving with wood, however, had hopefully begun—Detroit Post and Tribune.

102 DIRECTORY FOR 1837 DETROIT NEARLY FIVE DECADES AGO. There is possibly no greater pleasure reserved for old age than to take a retrospective view of a life well spent, to mark the stepping stones to success in the past, and to be able to enjoy the fruition of well directed effort. The every day occurrence of a business man receiving a telegram from Bulfan or Chicago. telephoning to his wife that he will not be at home that night, and in a few hours arriving in one or the other of these cities, would appear even more wonderful than the wildest story in the Arabian Nights to an inhabitant of Detroit ﬁfty years ago. if it were possible that he could be resurrected and made witness of the uses of our modern improvements and discoveries. Strange as it would undoubtedly seem to him of a half a century ago, yet the people of the present time have become so accustomed to the new modes of living that there are already many young business men who do not possess the faintest idea of what the lives, manners and customs of their grandfathers and great-grandfathers were two generations ago. Postmaster Codd has in his possession a work that reﬂects a great deal of the life of this city when its population was less than 10,000. It is a “Direc- tory of the City of Detroit with its environs and register of Michigan for the year 1837.” It is a book of about 200 pages, and professes to contain “a classiﬁcation of the professions and principal trades in the city, every information relative to oﬂicers of the municipal government, to public ofﬁces and ofﬁcers, to churches, associations and institutions, to shipping, steamboats, stages, &c. Also, a list of the State and County Ofﬁcers, &c., &c., by Julius P. Bolivar MacCabe.” It is printed by William Harsha, father of Walter Harsha, present clerk of the United States circuit court. The ﬁrst thirty six pages are given up to advertising, thus showing that there were many shrewd business men here at that time. Among these advertise- ments may be found much to amuse. One page announces that: “The Detroit Evening Spectator and Literary Gazette is published on an imperial sheet, on Wednesday and Saturday evenings at $4 per annum. Its ﬁrst page is devoted to belles lettres and science; its second, to the current news of the day, and editorial matter, comprising comments on passing events, full reports on important public meetings, remarks on literary and moral subjects, etc., etc. The two Iremaining pages are devoted to advertisements.” At that early date the city possessed a Detroit museum. It was situated on the corner of Jefferson avenue and Griswold street. By its advertisement “the public are respectfully informed that this establishment has lately been ﬁtted

An entire new cosmorama has been erected with new and splendid views. * ' Phantasmagoria, and phantascopal illusions will be exhibited every evening at 8 o’clock.” “Capt. Charles Walsh would present his unfeigned thanks to the citizens of Detroit. and the public, who have so kindly extended to him the-very lib- eral patronage he has been favored with at his establishment. He takes pleasure in stating that ‘The Shades’ has become a resort for gentlemen such as he is exceedingly happy to wait upon, and ﬂatters himself that in time his unwearied endeavors to please will give his place the character he intends it shall hear.” The “Capt.” does not state where his place of resort was located. H. Vaughan, keeper of the “Franklin retreat,” begs leave to inform the public that he is now receiving his winter supply of oysters, together with other delicacies of the season.” James G. Crane 8: Co., hatters, announce the receipt of goods, “all of which will be sold low for cash, and no growling.” At the time this directory was published there were three banks here: The Bank of Michigan, the oldest institution of the kind in the city, having a branch in Kalamazoo, capital $100,000, with the privilege of increasing it to $250,000, in the bank and branch; the Farmers and Mechanics’ bank of Michigan, capital $100,000, and the Michigan State bank, capital $100,000. In 1834 Detroit possessed only four wards and a population of 4.973 persons. Three years later there were 9,763 persons in Detroit. There were seven churches, two of which were Catholic, one Episcopalian, one Presbyterian, one Methodist, one Baptist, and one German Lutheran. Under the heading of charitable institutions appears the following: “Wayne county hospital and poorhouse—Fort Gratiot road, established in 1832. under the direction of the Rev. Mr. Kundig. This establishment is supported by a county cess. The average number of its inmates ranges from 25 to 40. Three ladies of the order of St. Clair super-intend the institution.” Of the orphan asylum it says: “This benevolent institution is situate on the Fort Gratiot turnpike road, at a distance of two§niles from the city. The number of children left destitute by the ravages of cholera in 1832, sug- gested to the Rev. Mr. Kundig, R. C. Clergyman, (who in the exercise of his ministry braved the dangers of this pestilence as he walked through its ‘valley of death’) the necessity of then establishing this asylum.” There were three markets. The city market, on the ﬁrst ﬂoor of the city hall; the Berthelet, at the corner of Randolph and Woodbridge streets, and 'the “'ashington. corner of Wayne and Larned streets. In 1837 seven rail-

104 STORY OF GLADWYN roads had been chartered to run into the city, and two of them were at that time in the course of contruction.- They were the Detroit & St. 'Joseph road, whose whole length was 196 miles, andthe Pontiac and Detroit road. The directory proper, containing the names of the residents of the city. is comprised in 38 pages, each page averaging 30 names. An appendix shows that Levi Cook was then mayor, George Byrd city clerk, James A. Vandyke city attorney. Israel Noble is quoted as sexton, and the city got along with three constables. H. V. Disbrow was chief engineer of the ﬁre department and there were ﬁve ﬁre wardens for each of the ﬁve wards. A mayor’s court held by the mayor, recorder and aldermen, or any three of them, was held on the second Monday in every month. Sheldon M’Knight was postmaster and Andrew Mack collector. T. E. Tallman was county clerk, and the sheriff, John M. Wilson, was content with two deputies—Detroit News. THE GLADIVYN AND PONTIAC FABLE BY HENRY A. FORD “Edmund Kirke” (Mr. J. R. Gilmore) apparently accepts without que's- tion the old story of Gladwyn and the Indian girl. and even furnishes it with a new picture, one truer to the probabilities of such a scene than the elabor- ate painting of the late Mr. Stanley. The story itself is familiar enough to all readers of western or aboriginal history, and need not be repeated. But. after passing almost unchallenged for nearly a century and a quarter, it is time to inquire whether the incident belongs to veritable history or to romance —whether it has sufﬁcient warrant in contemporary accounts, or took its origin in the legends and traditions of the wild woods. This inquiry will justify the brief space we care to give to it. The hero of this tale is Major Gladwyn, English commandant of Detroit and its dependencies in the year of grace 1763. and for some time before and after. The attempt of Pontiac and his warriors to seize the fort and mas“

GROUND FOR THE TRADITION 105 sacre the garrison by an act of treachery succeeding the present to \Gladwyn in a particular manner of a belt of wampum at the end of the great Ottawa’s address, occurred May 7th of that year. The commander’s full official reports have never been reached in the search for authentic accounts of the transac- tion; but, in a brief statement to his superior, Gen. Amherst, dated one week after the attempt, he simply says: “On the 7th he (Pontiac) came, but 1 was luckily informed the night before that he was coming to surprise us.” Not a word of Gladwyn’s has ever been discovered giving color to the tale that Pontiac’s plan was disclosed to him by an Ojibwa (Chippewa) mistress, or any other Indian girl. Two months later, in early July, 9. private letter was written from Detroit which was presently given publicity in the Newport (R. I.) Mercury for August 22, 1763. The writer thus tersely tells the story: “The Ottawas and some of the Chippewas to the number of 300 came to the fort and held a treaty with Major Gladwyn, who had information the evening before that the Indians were determined to fall upon and murder the ofﬁcers and soldiers in council, while they were to have parties at the diﬁerent merchants’ houses, to treat them in the same manner,” etc. Had there been valid ground for the tradition, it could hardly have failed to be noticed in the famous “Pontiac Manuscript,” discovered in this city many years ago, the supposed work of a French priest here at the time, and describing events with great particularity and minuteness. If any Indian woman had visited Gladwyn with information of the attempt, and the inci- dent was known among the garrison, he too must have known it, and in his garrulous way would have recorded it. But he writes nothing of the kind—' on the contrary says “the plot was disclosed to Gladwyn by a man of the Ottaway tribe.” But he does say further that the next day Pontiac sent four of his warriors from the Ottawa village (just above the present site of “'alkerville) to the Pottawatomie town (at Springwells, now the west end of Detroit, near the fort) to seize an Ojibwa girl whom be suspected; that they took her before Gladwyn but learned nothing from him to criminate her, and she was then taken to Pontiac, who beat her severely with a kind of racket or Indian ball club. A similar story was told long afterward by an old Indian to Henry Conner, the interpreter and trader, son of the Moravian pioneer near Mt. Clemens, and very likely has some foundation in fact, though it proves nothing for the historic truth of the woman’s guilt. No other contemporary letter, narrative, or ofﬁcial report has yet been found attributing the betrayal of the plot to an Indian girl. The story has been given reputable currency, chieﬂy by Mr. Parkman, the historian, who inserts it in much detail in his noble work on “The Conspiracy of Pontiac.” 14

106 THE CORRECT VERSION His immediate authority was a letter from the late Henry R. Schoolcraft, who rested his statement not‘ upon documentary evidence, but upon the tradition related to him by Conner, including the death of the woman by falling into a kettle of boiling maple sap. It had long before, however, been related and had got into literature. Jonathan Carver heard it on his visit to the north- west six years after the conspiracy, and embodied it in his book of travels. Other accounts are much later, but are in their origin altogether traditional, though in several cases made by persons living at the time of the treacherous attempt and subsequent siege under Pontiac. Pelletier, or Peltier, a descendant of one of the two coureu'rs des bois found here by Cadillac in 1701 was then 17 years old; and he told it to Gen. Cass in 1824, sixty one years afterwards. Maj. Thompson Maxwell, at Gen. Cass’s request, dictated his reminiscences of the siege to the late C. C. Trowbridge in 1821, ﬁfty eight years after. He was an illiterate man, and his relation is full of blunders. Other narratives given late in life by St. Aubin, Guoin, Mr. Meloche, and others are evidently affected by the romance with which old age will clothe the simplest occurrence of early days. In the total absence of any docu- mentary evidence or contemporary statement it must be held that the story grew to its present proportions and brilliancy from the mere suspicions of Pontiac and his brutal punishment of the Indian girl which subsequently in the legends of the prisoners and the savages received its variegated embellish- ments, that have lost nothing at the hands of successive historians. Mrs- Sheldon in her history of Michigan says that a soldier at the fort named William Tucker, who during captivity among the Indians had been adopted into a tribe, learned the designs of Pontiac from his savage sister and dis- closed them to Gladwyn. This is very likely the correct version of the affair and the soldier’s “sister” may plausibly enough have been the woman scourged by the haughty Pontiac—Detroit Tribune.

FOUNDERS. 107 THE OLD MORAVIAN MISSION AT MT. CLEMENS BY HENRY A. FORD one of the most obscure episodes in the annals of the northwest, so little noted that Judge Cooley’s recent history of Michigan (in the “American Commonwealth,” series) has not the least reference to it, is yet fraught with the highest interest to the reader of heroic and daring deeds, undertaken for civilization and christianity. It illustrates grandly the devotion, courage, endurance, and missionary enterprise of the Moravian brethren, who, next to the indefatigable “black robes” were the ﬁrst emissaries for Christ among the savages of the new world. The Unitas Fratrum, otherwise called the Moravian or Bohemian breth~ ren, trace their origin back of the Reformation to the time of John Huss. Early in the last century his disciples were expelled from Bohemia and Mora- via by their ﬁerce persecutors. Among their sympathizers in the neighbor- ing state of Saxony was the noble Nicholaus Ludwig, Count von Zinzendorf, the youthful son of a Saxon minister of state, and already eminent for his piety. He admitted a small party of the Hussites to reside upon his estate, organized ‘them and the refugees and converts who joined them in considerable numbers into a church, and so became the founder of the Moravian brother- hood. Beginning to preach the gospel he presently devoted his entire prop- erty and energies to the propagation of the faith. In 1736 he was banished from Saxony, and ﬁve years later came to America and established the Mora- vian church at Bethlehem, Pa., where its chief seat in this country still remains. After nearly twenty years’ service among the savages and the people of his native land, to which he was allowed to return, he died upon his ancestral estate, May 9, 1760. He left more than 100 works of his author~ ship in 'prose and verse, some of which. used as hymn books by the pious Moravians, are said to be characterized remarkably by indecent ﬁgures and allusions. . No christian church, not even the Roman Catholic, has been more distin- guished for zealous missionary spirit in the face of tremendous difﬁculties

108 ZEISBERGER—RECORD OF HIS DIARY than the Moravian. From the Cape of Good Hope to Labrador and Green- land, and from the steppes of Asiatic Russia to the deep forests of the new world, their mission stations have been planted with astonishing success. From Bethlehem the missions, principally among the Delaware Indians, were pushed rapidly westward into the tangled wilderness, during the latter half of the eighteenth century, until in 1771 they paused for a. time in the fertile valleys of the Tuscarawas and the Muskingum. Here were founded stations of some permanence, bearing the beautiful names of Schonbrunn, “The Shining Spring;” Lichtenau, “The Pasture of Light;" Salem, “Peace,” and Gnadenhutten, “The Tents of Grace.” The last was a favorite designation among the Moravians, no fewer than ﬁve of their American stations bearing it, including that founded in Michigan. In the Ohio country the founder and continuing head of the mission was the Rev. David Zeisberger, for sixty two years a most devoted and energetic servant of the church among the aborigines. He was born at the hamlet of Zauchtentha], Moravia, April 11, 1721, and ended a career of great usefulness in his 88th year,‘at Goshen, in the Tuscarawas valley. He was the founder of New Gnadenhutten, near Mt. Clemens, Mich., and thus has place among the heroes of our state history. His biographer, Bishop de Schweinitz, describes him as of small ﬁgure, but well proportioned; his face pleasing and cheerful, but seamed by endless care and the exposures of his long life among the savages; his dress neat and plain. He had become taciturn as an Indian, and often spoke in terms rather beﬁtting the council house than a christian church. This quality proved of eminent service to the patriot cause at a critical period of the revolution, and there was one, eventful moment when the single voice of Zeisberger, pleading successfully before the council of Delaware braves against alliance with the British, possibly saved American independence. He had been adopted into the-tribe of the Onondagas by a name signifying “On the Pumpkin,” and had great inﬂuence with most of the tribes which he encountered. ' , Upon the low bluff on the south side of the Clinton river (a century ago called the Huron), a little outside the southwest corner of the corporation of Mt. Clemens, and only twenty miles from Detroit. a slight depression in the open ﬁeld a few rods from the residence of Mr. Henry Steevens, and per- haps a few aged fruit trees. are the only visible memorials of the Moravian occupation in Michigan. The history of the events precedent to the settle- ment. of the settlement itself in July, 1782. and its abandonment four years after, has many points of interest. but must be brieﬂy told in these columns. Fortunately for our narrative. however. as well as for the future historian, new and important light is now thrown upon the'record by the recent trans-

SUMMONS TO DETROIT 109 lation and publication in two goodly octave volumes, of the diary of Zeisber- ger, which has lain in the original German and in manuscript for nearly a hundred years. With the invaluable aid of this the story is newly compiled. During the revolutionary struggle the Delaware nation had suffered terribly from both sides fOr their persistent neutrality. The christian Indians in the river valleys of Ohio lived directly upon the war path traversed by the Wyan- dottes and other tribes in alliance with the British, and the hardy borderers of Pennsylvania and Virginia; and so were between two ﬁres. In the fall of 1781, under orders from Detroit, the British headquarters in the north- west. they were forcibly deported from their peaceful and prosperous villages and left utterly destitute upon the Sandusky plains, from which they were forbidden to return. A winter of'awful cold and hunger had been passed in a wretched cluster of huts a few miles below the present Upper Sandusky, and when, in March following, a hundred of the miserable exiles had been allowed to go back to their towns to gather the standing corn, they were seized, brutally murdered and scalped by a party of frontiersmen, who wrongly held them responsible for some of the fresh atrocities in the settlement. The feeble remainder had been peeled and plundered, persecuted and threat- ened, scattered like partridges upon the mountains. Zeisberger and his pious associates were stripped of even the clothes they wore; and several months after. when summoned to Detroit, they were still in a state of abject ragged- ness and destitution. , It was in October, 1781, that the British commandant at Detroit, Major De Peyster, of generally happy memory, sent for the missionaries in Ohio to answer before him the charges made against thegn of sympathy and com- plicity with the American cause. The summons was answered by Zeisberger, Heckewelder, Sensemann, and Edwards, with ﬁve of the christian Delawares. The second of these, although not so long in the service as Zeisberger, became the most famous of the Moravians in America, partly by his writings on the Indians, which are still highly esteemed, and partly from his superior quali- ties. The historian Hildreth says: “In disposition he was like the Apostle John, while his companion, Zeisberger, partook of the spirit of St. Paul.” He was English born, but son of a German refugee, and died at Bethlehem Jan. 31, 1823, aged 80 years. Although much associated with Zeisberger in Ohio and elsewhere, he was not a founder of the mission on the Clinton, but several times visited and labored there, and should have honorable mention in the story of its brief career. The little party was but poorly equipped for the journey to Detroit, and had a painful time struggling on horseback through “the deep swamps and, troublesome waters” of northwestern Ohio. Somewhere near the present

110 ARRIVAL AT DETROIT—RECEPTION site of Toledo Zeisberger records: “We met today, as indeed every day as far as Detroit, a multitude of Indians of various nations, who were all bring- ing from Detroit horse loads of wares and gifts, and in such number that one would think they must have emptied all Detroit.” Arriving at the Itiver Rouge, which he calls the “Rush,” they could not get over for want of a boat1 and “had to pass the night three miles from the city, under the open heaven, but had nothing more to eat. “’e could see very plainly,” he adds. “the city and the whole country round about, on both sides the river, which is about a mile wide.” The next day they crossed in a canoe, and “came at once to Detroit, after we had ﬁrst passed through the settlement this side of the city, which is thinly settled, and is built like a village along the river.” They were at ﬁrst rather cavalierly received by De Peyster, but after con- siderable detention and much questioning, were fairly vindicated, when his demeanor changed, they were kindly treated and allowed to return to their Indians on the Sandusky. Zeisberger’s diary, however, does not quite bear \out the tale usually told of absolutely cruel and oppressive treatment accorded them there. He speaks always well of De Peyster, to whom the mission on the Clinton was afterwards much indebted. His notes of the visit and of a brief residence here the next year, awaiting the arrival of the christian Indians, include many interesting vmemoranda of the Detroit of more than a eentury ago. A minor problem of local history is solved by his mention of “Yankee hall,” a building near the fort, so called from the occupation by the American prisoners brought in by the Indians. This has heretofore been known in our local literature only by the corrupted name of “Jakey hall.” Mention is made of “the palisades in the shipyard.” which lay near the foot in Woodward avenue. Long afterwards, upon a Lake Erie island, Zeisberger observed “much red cedar timber,” quantities of which were taken to Detroit for ship building. The “upper end of Germantown,” a locality in or near Detroit, not yet identiﬁed, was the scene of the baptism of four.children by the missionary, , The missionaries received a fraternal call from the French priest (Father Peter Simple), “quite an old man, with whom, however, we could not speak, for he knew no English.” In various parts of the diary, Detroit morals receive but doubtful compliments, as the following: “It is wonderful here, and pleasant, if any one is found who shows a desire for God’s word, for the place here is like Sodom, where all sins are committed." The merchants reported of the christian Indians “that they have paid their debts to the last penny, say- ing it could well enough be seen that they were an honorable people, arid better than all the inhabitants around Detroit, who do not like to pay their debts, and add thereto.” Many well known or'totally unknown citizens of Detroit

REMOVAL TO NEW GNADENHUTTEN k 111 at that time come into the narrative, as Elias Schmidt (baptized by Zeis- berger, June 23, 1782), Isaac Williams, the Indian trader, and his companion, Cassedy “Homes” and his wife, “some gentle people,” who went in sleighs over the ice on the lake to visit the mission, McKee and Elliot, the famous (or infamous) British agents and traders, a “merchant from Detroit,” who had his two children baptized respectively John and Mary, and others. “A man by the name of Halse” was found living near the mouth of the Detroit river, whose child Heckewelder baptized. Baptisms had been conducted here, it seems, with considerable looseness: “As there is no ordained preacher 0f the Protestant church in Detroit, the justice baptizes the children also, or the commandant, if it be asked of him; but to many this is not satisfactory, and they are scrupulous about it.” Hence the Moravians are often resorted to for this ordinance, and occasionally for marriage. A period of great scarcity of food in Detroit is noticed July 18, 1784. One of the Indians had just returned to the mission and reported “nothing to be had for cash. With his own eyes he saw a Spanish dollar offered a baker for a pound of bread and refused. A hundred weight of ﬂour costs £7 13s, and is not to be had.” At another time, the same summer, two Frenchmen from Detroit brought word that “in the settlement there is a very bad out- look. They said that most people there had no bread and lived from the weeds they ‘cooked and eat.” I March 1, 1782, another summons was received by Zeisberger and his com- panions on the Sandusky, this time that “the teachers and their families” should be brought to Detroit. It was now the intention of De Peyster, whose mind had again been poisoned by the Wyandottes, to keep the missionaries here or send them away to Bethlehem; but after a time he consented that they should found a new mission station in the vicinity of Detroit. and send for their christian Indians. Under the depressing inﬂuences of another removal, but particularly of the horrible massacre of their brethren and sisters on the 7th and 8th of March, in the Tuscarawas valley, the Delawares slowly arrived, and on the 2ch of July Zeisberger and John G. Jungmann, with their wives, Wm. Edwards and Michael Young, who were unmarried, and four Indian families, in all but twenty ﬁve person, set out in a sail boat for the Clinton river, on whose banks, at the site already indicated, a small tract for a mission had been procured from the Chippewas. “Three miles from the city we came to an island where we took aboard our two pilots, who were to conduct us to the appointed place.” It was evening of the next day before the devious windings of the little river had been traversed for a few miles, and the destined point reached. Here, among much excellent forest, the diarist noted “wild cherry trees, which had a ﬁne red wood, of which in
Page 112
112 FAVORS RECEIVED Detroit the most beautiful cabinet work is made." The place was evidently the site of an old Indian town, of which many “corn holes” and other indi- cations were observed. Religious services were held the same evening around the bivouac ﬁre. for which the Moravian text of the day seemed specially ﬁtting: “For ye shall go out with joy and be led forth with peace." Tents were pitched, but in a few days huts were erected, which in due time became substantial cabins. Only two rows were built, one on each side of a street, “full four rods wide.” each lot having a front of three rods or ﬁfty feet, very nearly. Accounts vary as to the number ultimately erected, from twenty to thirty. A rude chapel, not much larger than the other buildings, was ﬁrst occupied on the 5th of November. There was no blockhouse or stockade. but the little church was slightly fortiﬁed. This Moravian station appears to have existed during several months of its short life, without a name. It is not mentionedby Zeisberger by the favorite name of Guadenhutten until Sept. 4, 1783, and it was not until Loskiel wrote his history of the Moravian missions that it received the designation by which it has since been known as New Guadenhutteu. The settlement was founded under auspices that well entitled it to be called “Tents of Grace.” Every- body at ﬁrst was kind. Major De Peyster had supplied the infant colony with unusual liberality. “He said.” Zeisberger wrote. “we must not think he had put us where we must suffer want; he wished to supply both us and our Indians with food until we ourselves had a harvest and could supply our- selves.” In a single issue from the government stores he provisioned the colony for six months. Shortly after this De Peyster was superseded by “the Lord George Hay,” as Zeisberger in his simplicity calls him, who was also favorable to the mission, and showed it many kindnesses. The diary enables us to ﬁx almost to a day the time of Governor Hay‘s death. which occurerd here, since by these memoranda he was buried Aug. 2, 1785. The merchants of Detroit were similiarly hospitable. "When we came into the city we were welcomed everywhere, people were glad to see us, gave us good wishes and showed themselves serviceable to us. There were some peo- ple who offered us on credit or upon payment to provide our Indians for ﬁshing, with ﬂour, corn and all materials in the winter when the lakes were frozen—an important matter for us, and one that always interested us." Hunting and ﬁshing in the vicinity of the village were excellent, and the second summer their humble crops began to be available. The characteristic feebleness of Indian agriculture, however, had not greatly improved under the inﬂuence of the missionaries, and but twenty ﬁve to thirty acres had been improved when the station was broken up.

WEATHER—GROWTH OF MISSION 113 Besides their modest husbandry, the hunting and ﬁshing, sugar making in 1the season, and frequent religious service at all times of the year, the Indians made canoes, baskets, brooms, bowls, ladles and other simple articles, for which ready market was found in Detroit. A salt lick was found somewhere in the back country, from which-the Indians returned, “having boiled a good lot of excellent salt, which is just the thing for them, salt being here a scarce thing.” In the spring of 1783 “some Indian brethren went to the mouth of the river to help block out his house for a white man, who wishes to settle there and invited them “the ﬁrst note, we believe, of civilized settlement in Macomb county, elsewhere than at_.\ie\v Gnadenhutten. As before hinted, visits of Detroiters to the mission were frequent. December 19. 1785, Some of the Indian brethren went “to lay out and make a new and straight road to Detroit.” This, when ﬁnished, became the famous “Moravian road,” the ﬁrst wagonway made in the interior of Mich- igan. It was “twenty three and one half miles from our town to Detroit, straight through the bush.” The annals of the four years at New Gnadenhutten are comparatively uneventful. The winter of 1783-4 was terribly severe. The “gentle people” from Detroit who visited the station January 10th, “simply to see our town,” reported “that by the thermometer it has not been so cold for twenty eight years as it is now, it being seven degrees lower than in the whole time.” On the 24th, Zeisberger makes entry: “This week it snowed several days in succession, and the snow was now three feet deep, so that it was hard to get ﬁrewood.” And a few days later: “It has snowed nearly every day, and the snow gets ever deeper. Our Indian brethren, about whom we are most anxious and distressed, have many of them, nothing more to eat. " " " No one had thought there would be such a winter. Old settlers in Detroit say that as long as they have lived there the snow has never been so deep.” Within three days, however, by the help of snow shoes, more than a hundred deer were shot, which removed all the present fear of famine. But the streams were frozen hard, and out upon the lake, a mile from the shore, the ice was three feet two inches thick, and did not go out till May. The snow was ﬁnally ﬁve feet deep, and remained till late in the spring. Most of the season was spent in a struggle for comfort, if not for life. The mission grew only by natural increase and the immigration of chris- tian Delawares formerly in Zeisberger’s ﬂock. It was started, we have seen, with but nineteen Indian souls, including children. On Christmas, 1782, he writes: "There. were together ﬁfty three of us. white and brown.” Many of the converts came from the Shawanese towns in Ohio the next May, and in his last entry for the year he says: “Twenty six brethern have this year 15
Page 114
114 DISPERSION OF MORAVIAN COMMUNITY been absolved and sixteen readmitted to the holy communion.” Natural increase in 1783 did not quite keep pace with death—ﬁve against six. Among the births was Susanna, daughter of Richard Conner, born Dec. 16th, and baptized the Sunday following. But one new communicant was received in 1784, one woman baptized, eight children born, three couples married, two adults died. At the end of 1785,-the last entire year spent at New Gnadenhutten, Zeisberger was able to record only the baptism of two adult women and two girls, as many persons admitted to the communion, one child dead during the year. “The inhabitants here on the Huron [Clinton] river are 117 Indian souls.” There were probably no more when the removal occurred, less than four months afterwards. No impression whatever had been made upon the heathen Chippewas, none of whose villages were in their vicinity. Friendly relations were maintained. and there is no account of Indian alarm at the settlement, a remarkable thing for a pioneer town. But when the Chippewas heard that the war of the revolution had closed, and the chief claiming the land on the river had died, they began to suggest the removal of the mission whose heads were formally warned by a deputation of the heathen in the middle of January, 1786. A few weeks afterwards they were advised by the governor of Detroit to comply with the wishes of those whose hospitality they had so far peacefully enjoyed, and on Thursday, the 20th of April, the congregation betook itself to the chapel for the last time, and, after solemn service of thanksgiving, loaded their canoes, and in the afternoon paddled sorrowfully down the river. At Detroit they took two sailing vessels for the Cuyahoga, upon whose banks they settled in poor shape for a. time, and, after some further wanderings, a remnant of them ﬁnally located at Fairﬁeld, a few miles beyond Chatham, Canada, and near the battle ﬁeld of the Thames, where Tecumseh was killed. Their improvements on_ the Clinton were purchased by Maj. Ancrum, the British commandant at Detroit, and John Askin, the trader, for a total sum of $450. Some of the cabins were occupied by tenants for a number of years, but all long since disappeared, leaving no trace except the cellar of Richard Conner, indicated near the beginning of this narrative. “None of us all remained behind,” says Zeisberger, “save Conner’s family, - who himself knew not whether to go nor what to do.” He was the sole Mo- ravian layman who had been allowed to settle there. Richard Conner (originally O’Conner) was a native of Ireland, but had migrated from Mary- land to the wilderness west and married a white girl who had been a captive among the Shawanese. After Lord Dunmore’s campaign against the Ohio Indians (1764), they settled in Pittsburg, but went to the Moravian town of Schonbrunn to seek their son, who was now himself a captive. Here they so \

GRADUATION LAW 115 commended themselves that, against Moravian usage, they were permitted to remain. June 14, 1782, they followed the missionaries to Detroit in a ship from Sandusky “on account of,the unrest caused by war,” but did not go to the mission till the last of March, 1783. The rest of Conner’s life was spent at the Moravian site, where he died April 17, 1808. He left four sons, James, John, William, and Henry, who became somewhat notable in the pioneer days of eastern Michigan, and are well remembered by a few of the old citi- zens of Detroit. The last named, called Wah-besken-dip by the Indians, was renowned for his great strength, and was a superior interpreter and trader among the savages. He fought with Harrison in the battle of the Thames, and was present at the death of Tecumseh. Richard Conner’s only daughter, Susanna, was born at the mission Dec. 16, 1837, the ﬁrst child of white parents born within the limits of the present Macomb county. She married the late Judge Elisha Harrington, whose farm covered the site of the old mission. A part of the tract was subdivided in 1837, during the internal improvement mania, to form the village at the beginning of the Clinton 8: Kalamazoo canal, at ﬁrst called Casino, but later known as Frederick. A few ruinous houses are all that now remain of it.—-Detroit Tribune. \ “'ATERTOWN THIRTY YEARS AGO [TUSCOLA COUNTY] The following paper was read by the Hon. Enos Goodrich of Watertown, at the pioneer picnic at Mayville, August 21, 1884: The year 1854 was one long to be remembered in the early history of northern Michigan, for it was in that year that the passage of what was known as the “Graduation Law” gave an impetus to settlement such as the state had not known since the speculating days of 1836. Steadily but very slowly had been the march of improvement for the intervening eighteen years. Many of the wild lands of Michigan had been in market from'twen'ty to forty years with- out a purchaser. This state of facts, not only in Michigan, but in other frontier states, prompted Congress, in the year 1854 to reduce the price of all lands having been in the market twenty years or over, down to prices from one dollar to twelve and one half cents an acre. according to a graduated scale, governed by the time they had been in market. This act was intended
Page 116
\ 116 RESIDENTS OF \VATERTOWN for the beneﬁt of actual settlers, but like most other benevolent acts it was in many cases perverted to purposes of speculating. Nevertheless there is no doubt but it resulted in actual beneﬁt to the country. At the time of the passage of the “Graduation Law” about three quarters of the lands of Watertown were still the property of the government, and the portions that had been located were almost exclusively taken for the timber. The speculating epoch of “wildcat days.” which ran wild over the southern counties, had just dipped over the border and taken three small tracts in Watertown near North lake. On the 19th day of December, 1836, Calvin C. Waller, had made a small entry of land on sections 32 and 33, and the 23d day of January, 1837, Alva Bishop invaded the township by making a location on 33.’ But who Calvin C. Waller and Alva Bishop may have been are facts not known to the writer. Whether they have gone to join the majority of the pioneers of that early period in the better land, or still live in other climes- must remain for others to tell. And now the wilds of Watertown enjoy a long season of unbroken repose, until John McCartney invades the very heart of the township by a location on section 21 under the date of October 18, 1851. During the next succeeding three years quite extensive tracts of land were located for their timber. Principal among the locators are the names of Chester Baxter, who, I think, was a Vermonter, and Royal C. Remmick and Enoch J. White. both citizens of Michigan, both widely and favorably known to our early pioneers. and both of whom, after a long and successful career, have years ago passed from the scenes of earth. Of those who purchased lands in Watertown, not far from thirty years ago, I present an imperfect list of such as are known to be living and such as are known to have passed away. Among the living are Nathaniel M. Berry, Charles Dickinson, Joseph Colling, Thomas Duncan, James Docherty, Samuel P. McNeil, Franklin Wright, James McCartney, Jacob W. Brown. Patrick O’Neil, Nathan Potter, Nathan N. Wilson, Thetford; Edward H. Thompson, Flint; John H. Mar- kell, James H. 0. Blades, Fenton; Jasper Johnson, Curtiss Coffeen, Samuel Salein, Oakland Co.; James L. Cain, Enos Goodrich. Among those known to have passed away we have to record the names of George Turner, Ira S. Begel, Alphant J. Glynn, Charles Merrill. Benjamine Decker, Samuel Mc- Neil, Amos L. Hinney, Ira Davenport; Merrill Henry. In looking back over the past thirty years it is almost wonderful to note the very large percentage of early pioneers who have been spared through the 'vicissitudes of life, to assist in pushing on the grand work of improvement, and who. like the old guard of Napoleon, can still stand side by side and
Page 117
, > PRIMEVAL FORESTS 11‘7 answer to the roll call of Water-town's early founders. But who can say how long the list I have presented to-day will remain unbroken. As the Hon. Andrew Parsons said to us when he dismissed the senate of 1835. “It is not probable that we hall all meet again in time.” Were it within the province of my subject I might here waft away your thoughts to the untrodden regions of the future, in imagination contemplative of what Watertown is destined yet to be, but my theme leads me to linger with the past. But before passing from this stage of the subject it is meet that we should pay a passing tribute to the memory of two of Water-town’s old settlers, who within the past few weeks have been suddenly called away from the scene of their earthly labors. Benjamin Sperry and Henry E. Chaplain, though not among Watertown’s very earliest settlers, may justly be classed among its pioneers. It must be at least a quarter of a. century since these two men sat down among us and united their labors with ours in pushing forward the work of improvement. And nobly and manfully did they do their work, closing their labors only with the closing hour oftheir lives. One day early in July just passed, I was driving from Fostoria to this village, and met Mr. Sperry, also driving his team; he seemed hale and vigorous, cheerful and active as I had known him in the years of the past. It was the last time I ever saw his honest face; perhaps in less than an hour from that moment, in returning homeward, near the spot where I met him, his team took fright and dashed him to death. Scarcely had the startling news died away, when it was heralded that old Mr. Chaplain, while in the act of carrying a pail of water had dropped down dead; “Heart disease” was the verdict, though why should we wonder that after 84 years of active service the wheels of life should at last stand still. Thus ended the earthly career of two of Watertown's most respected pioneers. How often do we see the world run wild over some military chieftain, whose only merit is that he has steeped the earth in the blood of his fellow beings. In this connection let us call to mind the language of the poet: “A \vit’s a feather and a chief‘s a. rod, An honest man's the noblest work of God." But I must return to linger a little while with our primeval forests. Thirty years ago to-day there was not a white settler in Watertown. From one extremity to the other it was clad in a garb of almost the heaviest timber that I ever saw. Here'grew the beech in the greatest perfection I ever saw it in any country. Here too were found the different varieties of maple in perfection. Oak was not abundant, but the rock elm and the linden or bass- wood were abundant. and of the ﬁnest quality. On interval lands the black ash and the American elm towered side by side in nature's grandest form.

118 EARLY SETTLERS IN WATERTOWN Here, too, the poet Burns might have embraced his “Highland Mary” be- neath the “Gay Green Burk” . (or birch), but _the “Hawthorn Blossom” was rarely if everfound. A few swamps of cedar of the most impenetrable character made a safe home for the owl, the wolf. and the wildcat. Along the gentle hillsides the dark green hemlock cast its sombre shadow—while towering high over all waved and murmured the green branches of the mag- niﬁcent pine. I will notvstop to weary you with details of height, diameter, and circumference, but will say that during a lifetime spent largely in the midst of pine timber I have seldom if ever seen the pine of Watertown equaled, and certainly never surpassed. ' Why is it that the denizen of the forest loves his toil? Why is it that he shrinks from no hardships and murmurs at no privation? It is that he is brought in daily and hourly contact with the scenery of nature where he imbibes “Health in the gale and freshness on the stream." He takes the blessings of nature from the fountain head. The late Wil- liam S. Patrick, of Flint, widely and well known as an adroit and accom- plished woodsman, once assured me that “he never in his life spent a long day in the woods.” Beguiled by the presence of the ever varying works of God the forest dweller drinks in inspiration from the works of nature by which he is surrounded. The poet Armstrong in speaking of the atmosphere of the crowded city says: “It is not air ~ ' That from a thousand lungs wreaks back to thine." The‘ blind poet Ossian, when reclining on the mossy banks of his native highland, drank in inspiration from “the sounding woods of Garmallar,” which gave to his wild, weird songs a freshness that will go with them while poetry shall be read and time shall endure. ' But to return. It was thirty years ago the 20th of last April when Marcus Tetesouth, Alfred Fox and myself left our camps in Millington, and with our packs and equipage climbed the rugged hills and threaded the ravines along the section line west of Watertown center. That night we slept in an Indian wigwam on section 21, and near the line now dividing the farms of Mr. Hoyle and Didymer Johnson. Our next night we slept on the north bank of Elm creek, a little below the Fostoria brick yard, on land now owned by Linus'Hart. But why pursue our journey further, now that my comrades are gone. For the past twenty seven years Alfred Fox has slept in the Good- rich cemetery. and Marcus Tetesouth has reposed in the Millington cemetery for a dozen years at least. My own wanderings have been long and weary to bring me. here in your presence to-day.

RETROSPECTION 119 It was late in September 1854, when in company with Nathaniel M. Berry, the ﬁrst settler of Watertown, and nearly a dozen other adventurers I came clambering and blundering through windfalls and cedar swamps, from the old Farrell saw mill in Marathon to the quarter post between sections 26 and 25, and one half mile west from the present village of Fostoria. Several of ' the company after making choice selections of land left them never more to return, with a solemn conviction that town 10 north, range 9 east, was too far from paradise; and of the whole company Squire Berry was the only one that ever perfected his claim and made a home of it, myself excepted. Between that late September evening and the close of the year, so far as the best date can be gathered, there was but one more actual settlement per- fected in Watertown and that by a genius known as “Trait Crosby,” who staked his claim where Henry Kincaid now lives, on the southeast corner of section 25, one mile east of Fostoria, He remained but a short time and like the wind that “bloweth where it listeth,” no one knew when e’er he came or whither he went. Several cabins were erected in October. Franklin Wright and Alphant Glynn who came together from Ohio, and Samuel McNeil and his son “Perry” from Genesee county in this state, were among the very ﬁrst beginners, but their cabins remained empty until the following spring. The advent of 1855 brought with it a swarm of settlers and from that period onward Watertown has been getting out of the woods. If her citizens are worthy of their opportunity, health and prosperity, wealth and happiness lie along their future pathway. 'As to myself, I feel that my earthly journey is drawing to its close. One week ago last Monday I passed my seventy ﬁrst mile stone. My life was begun and my youth spent in the wilds of western New York. Emigrating to Michigan in 1836, when _it was a territory, the years of my mature manhood were spent in the county of Genesee, and for the last quarter of a century I have looked upon Watertown as my home. And as I look back over my past life my greatest satisfaction is derived from the thought that I have helped to cause the wilderness of three new counties “to bud and blossom as the rose,” and my greatest regrets for the future arise from the fact that it is not for me to settle and improve a few more counties.

120 SALT \VILLIAMS THE SCHOONER MINK. AND OTHER ITEMS BY EPHRAIM S. \YILLIAMS, 0F FLINT In a former article. where I spoke of our family (the family of Oliver \Villiams) coming to Detroit in the autumn of 1815 on board of the schooner Mink, I overlooked an incident relating to the Mink that I think' should not be passed by. , The schooner Mink (report said) was built upon Lake Superior, by the Hudson Bay company, for the transportation of their goods and furs up and down that lake. The Mink, by accident or otherwise, ran the rapids of the Sault Ste. Marie safely, and for many years ran on the lower lakes. I remem- ber hearing it said that she was driven down the Sault river in a gale of wind. It seems impossible, when one stands and sees the Indians run those rapids, with their canoes, requiring the greatest skill to clear the rocks in safety, yet the schooner Mink made the trip without touching a rock. Perhaps no other animal but a “Mink” could have succeeded as well, being a water animal. I must say we thought very poorly of her as a passenger vessel in 1815, for her accommodations were very poor indeed; the cabin was only four or ﬁve feet high and we could not stand upright in it, and the bilge water scented the cabin awfully, so bad that the family camped on the deck under a tent made with sails that the captain was kind enough to furnish us. In the days when the Pontiac railroad was run (or walked) by a single horse, there was an old couple who took passage from Pontiac for Detroit. Mr. Alfred Williams, called Salt Williams, was on board the train. The old lady became fatigued and, addressing Mr. Williams, not kndwing he was one of the proprietors of the road, she remarked that they went very slowly and she would like to know when they would get to Detroit. Mr. Williams (Salt) stuttered badly, and he replied to the old lady as follows, “I don‘t k-k-now if we e-v-e-r shall get there ;‘ a sh-o-r-t time ago a couple about m~m-i- dd-le age tried it and they d-d-i-e-d of old age before they got to D-de-troit, and I g-g-u-ess we sha-ll.” The old lady said she thought it was about so. Mr. Williams had a splendid white horse that all delighted to drive, espe-

EARLY IMPRESSIONS OF FLINT 121 cially the ladies. When Mr. Schuyler Hodges died, in 1845, Mr. (Salt) Wil- liams proposed that his white horse be put before the hearse at the funeral as he was not only handsome but a great favorite of all the family and friends. This was done, and when the funeral procession was about twenty rods from the house the horse stopped and refused to move another step. Mr. Williams tried every way to have him proceed, but no, he would not stir. A man was sent to the livery stable to get another horse to take the place of the white one, and the procession had to wait for the change. I have heard it said that some horses will not go in front of a hearse, and old Charley was one. of that kind. Mr. Williams coaxed and patted him, but it was no go; he would look around, shake his head, and refuse to move; when he Was unhitched he walked out and was all right. Mr. Hodges was a particular friend of the horse, he drove him frequently, and the old fellow did not propose to do that kind of duty. FLINT TIVENTY YEARS AGO PRESENTED BY EPHRAIM S. \VILLIAMS OF FLINT “How wondrous are the changes, Since twenty years ago." EDITOR CITIZEN :—A little after the hour of noon, in one of the faultless autumnal days of which the denizens of Michigan are so proud, twenty years ago. I descended from a seat beside that loquacious Jehu, John Stevens, on one of the three great stages of Boss‘s line, on that day running between Fentonville and East Saginaw, at the door of the “Carlton house” in Flint, where I was met by the stately proprietor of the "line" with unlighted cigar between his lips and the genial presence of the landlord, John B. Hamilton. I Recalling vividly, after the lapse of two decades, my conﬂicting emotions as I stood among strangers in the little place which I had chosen for my future home and with,whose interests, mercantile and social, I was destined 16

’122 SAGINAW STREET, FLINT. to become identiﬁed for so long a period, and of my impressions of the place then, and of the place and people as my. acquaintance with both increased, it seemed a ﬁtting time—and perhaps not entirely without interest—t0 revive some of the old recollections, and conjure into our presence some of the faces and forms which long ago were familiar in various situations in life and helped to make up the society of this newly dubbed city. Entering the city on my elevated seat, my ﬁrst impressions of Saginaw street were more favorable than had my advent occurred two or three years earlier, for the devastation caused by the ﬁres on either side had been in part overcome by the erection of the block north of Kearsley street, including the Citizens’ bank buildings and the Dewey block. The Williams’ block on the northeast corner of Kearsley street was completed and the postoﬁice, with E. S. Williams as postmaster, located in the rear, was proud of its new and ﬁrst display of letter drawers and boxes; W. I. Beardsley occupying a corner with the ﬁrst “news depot.” The Presbyterian and old Episcopal churches were well up town and Dr. Willett felt little apprehension of being elbowed out of home by business encroachments. Since that day the vacancy south of the Dewey block has been ﬁlled, the entire block below Union treet built and the block of ﬁne shops between the railroad track and river, the entire block south of First street to the Presbyterian church, the row below Union street on the east, except the old Thurber block, the entire row of ﬁne buildings between Kearsley and First streets on the east, except the City hotel and the two stores of James Decker and Charles Harrison, the Bishop block above the old Hazelton building, the Gazley block, Bishop’s, J udd’s and Pratt’s ﬁne stores and the Charles block, between First and Second streets and covering the ground of the old Gazley rookery, the Rev. D. E. Brown’s residence and the old Episcopal church; and since the ﬁre, which wiped out the “Irving,” the splendid blocks which include the four story Masonic Temple and the adjoining new hotel, besides'several brick stores between Second and Third streets, the city hall, court house, etc. So much for Saginaw street. The Williams block spoken of above was built by E. S. Williams and was the ﬁrst block of brick stores of three stories built in Flint in 1853-4. All business except in the mills was conﬁned to Saginaw street. And how changed the business personae of the city! Before'the advent of Smith or Judd or Stone; of Spencer, or Davidson, or McIntyre! Then James Henderson was the oldest and best known merchant, and Dewey & Crosman had but recently issued their “New Store” ad, while “Co'tharin’s” was still the place to ﬁnd whatever could not be found else- where. The farmer. driving into the city with his load of produce, could seek his own market unmolested, for the present custom of buying on the

PIONEER BUSINESS MEN 123 street was not seen, and Henderson’s or Dewey’s, Grant Decker’s, O’Donoughue’s, Fox’s. or the mill, comprised nearly the limit of the market facilities. Old residents will easily recall the trains of Indian ponies laden with maple sugar, or baskets, or blackberries, the entire stock of which it was conﬁdently expected Charley Deweyor Cotharin would buy. These were all general stores and sold anything from nails to a lace shawl. H. C. “'alker and Morrison were also engaged in the dry goods trade; Jas. C. Decker, W. R. Hubbard (son of Diodate Hubbard, one of Oakland’s pioneers) and J. H. Townsend dealt more exclusively in groceries: and Forsyth, Higgins and Paul Stewart conﬁned their trade to hardware and stoves. The Clarks, Frank Frary, Wesson, Witherbee and Dr. Moon furnished the drugs, while Drs. Lamond, Drake, Clark, and the new ﬂedged M. D.’s, Axford and Wilson, helped to dispense them, Dr. Eldridge being the only homazopathic practitioner at that time, and Drs. Smith and Rea pulled teeth. W. L. Sholes, Dewstoe, Ford, Sutton and Lee were knights of the shears and tape measure; and Joe Cautfman and Lieberman sold clothing ready made. Barker & Ripley, John Quigley, A. L. Stewart and John Delbridge cared for the shoeless, while Skidmore crowned the head and Uncle Dave Mather the hands. True, and Beecher and Lounsbury supplied the necessary articles of jewelry and kept old Time’s implements in order, while Stevenson ‘added to these useful employments the pleasant duty of supplying the mental food for old and young to be found in books. Holmes. Charles, Miller and Sullivan supplied the houses with furniture, while George Hill furnished in addition the last narrow tenement the citizen required and Johnson placed at the head the marble slab which told their virtues. Gazley, Pursell, Knickerbocker and'Vassault harnessed the horses and Pruman and Wicks shod them. E. H. Hazelton and A.-W. Brockway discounted the western money for you, and Fenton, Newton, Davis, Thom- son Howard, Carr, Chauncey Wisner, 0. Adams, C. K. Williams, George K. Cummings ct al. read the law for a consideration; Charles Hascall dispensed justice and Charley Griswold and Jake Farley served the papers. Very many incidents of those days, though not very remote to many of the older citizens remaining, come to one’s mind, of which space forbids the mention; and one recalls the familiar faces of many then daily seen on the streets who have forever passed from our view (and whose absence which twenty years may effect) each with his peculiar characteristics, and’with whose name is associated some reminiscence of early days of the little city; the digniﬁed Fenton and the courteous Avery, the brusque Benj. Pierson. the facetious George Cumings, the genial Roosevelt, the shrewd Gregory, the Hendersons, the Walkers, C. S. Payne, Witherbee, Crapo, Robert Page, R. W. Jenny and

124 FIRST ELECTION—BRIDGE George Crocker. Then the “Pinery” (now 4th ward) had just been cleared of its trees, and a few scattering houses stood in that now populous ward. The site of the Thayer house was then the abode of Boss’s stage horses. All west of the Baptist church, save two or three little dwellings, was a. broad cow pasture, the entire suburbs much less extended, and the population but about one third its present number. I trust I have not occupied too much space in these imperfect recollections of twenty years ago. I do not claim for them absolute accuracy, and mention only such names as readily came to my mind.” This “Twenty Years Ago” must have been written twenty orthirty years ago, and more have been the changes and improvements since that time. The Carleton House he mentions was, afterwards, the Irvin, and was burned with all the buildings on that side of the street from the Williams corner (which still stands), to the river. These have been since rebuilt, with ﬁne brick. buildings for business, to the river, 'and the beautiful new iron bridge over the river on Saginaw street. I In the spring of 1855 the ﬁrst charter election was held and Grant Decker was elected the ﬁrst mayor. That spring we had unusually high water. There was a very handsome enclosed bridge (painted white), a noble structure, but the water raised it from its foundation, and it swung around, end to the stream, and ﬂoated down stream majestically, more like a large noble steamer than a bridge. The entire population of the city was on hand to witness the departure of our nobl'e bridge. The water at this time was up to and over Union street to the Masonic temple and Brant house, and where now the F. 8: P. M. R. R. depot stands and the Thayer house is the water was up to the middle of the windows of several residences. All had to move out of their dwellings. The river was crossed for a long time by a boat ferry. The west side of Saginaw street from Walker‘s corner was burned to the river. It was soon rebuilt with very ﬁne two story wooden buildings, mostly all painted white and making a good appearance when ﬁnished and occupied for business. Fire again burned it all out nearly to the river, then it was rebuilt with brick as at' present, and thus we have progressed. Notwithstanding all these disasterste had lots of fun and many laughable incidents—which cannot well be laid before the public—yet the few left now have many a good hearty laugh over those times, and enjoy talking them over frequently.

OLD SAGINAW COURT HOUSE 125 RETROSPECTION BY EPHRAIM s. WILLIAMS, or FLINT ' [Incidents connected with the building of the old court house now (March 3, 1886), being torn down at Sa ' aw City; the contract for the erection of the building signed nearly half a century ago; the bi for doing the work, the name of the contractor, etc.] Forty eight years, ago to-morrow (March 3, 1886)~ marked the day that a contract was signed for the erection in Saginaw county of a building suitable ' to the needs and requirements of the county ofﬁcials of that time. The day upon which this forty eighth anniversity may be recorded will also witness the destruction of the building. Workmen for the three weeks past have been engaged in tearing it down, and its forty eighth birthday may only be writ- ten on a pile of debris. This old structure today, as compared with the‘new building, which has been termed a “palace” and other synonymous names, dwindles into mere nothing; yet forty eight years ago, when the initial steps towards its construction were taken, it was regarded by those who were about to build- it as a structure of which they could feel proud, and they undoubt- edly did. Accustomed to meeting in private houses, in small, incommodious halls, it was no more than natural that they should regard the bundle of 'speciﬁcations, and not long after the building which grew out of them, with a smile of satisfaction. I From the dim and dusty records of the proceedings of the township board of nearly ﬁfty years ago was learned a brief history of the preparations for the construction of the building. At a meeting of the board held on the 2d day of March, 1838, a resolution that a building for the use of county oﬁ‘lcials be constructed was introduced. There were present at this meeting, Jere- miah Riggs, a supervisor; A. Ure and A. Miller, two justices of the peace; and E. S. Williams, the township clerk. Those ﬁve persons laid the plans for the building that has served the county for so many years. Many old resi- dents will remember the forms and faces of those ﬁve persons. References are not at hand at present to say much of these early incidents. E. S. Wil- liams, brother of Gardner D. Williams,now deceased, is still living. In the
Page 126
126 I SALE OF CONTRACT early days he was a prominent resident of Saginaw City and county. He has been spoken of in connection with Harvey Williams, the pioneer, whose popularity is well remembered. Mr. Harvey Williams came to Saginaw many years after G. D. and E. S. Williams. Mr. Williams is now a resident of Flint, and recently passed his 84th birthday. He has accumu- lated enough of this world’s goods to be able to live comfortably in his old age. He occasionally makes this city a visit and his cordial greeting always _ makes him welcome. ' A. Miller refers to Judge Albert Miller, of Bay City, brother of Mrs. Jewett, of this city. Mr. Miller is too well known in this city to require much mention here. He was prominent in every movement of importance in the early days. Mr. Miller still visits his friends and acquaintances in this city. He'has been spending some time of late in looking up documents pertaining to the early history of this State, which to him is always interest- ing. Andrew Ure, a member-of the township board, and who was active in build- ing the old court house, was the father of Robert and John Ure. and was by occupation a farmer. He long since went “to that bourne from whence no traveler returns,” but his name will always be remembered in connection with early events, Of Jeremiah Riggs, whose name is also attached to the proceedings of the township board, but little is known. Sufﬁce it to say, that his name is re- corded with otliers whose deeds were honorable and advantageous to the early settlers. (Mr, Riggs was an early pioneer of Saginaw and Genesee counties, known as Judge Riggs.) At the meeting spoken of above the bids for the construction of the county building were opened. There were four in all, as follows: Asa Hill and Benjamin Stevensbn ........................... $11,500 W. L. P. Little ........................... . ................... 12.000 R. H. Burrdick ............................................... 11,000 Bunker S: Tuthill ..................... . .............. . ........ 11,950 It seems from the record that the bids in some manner were unsatisfactory to the board. for, on motion of Albert Miller, “the board proceeded to sell the contract for the erection of the building at auction, reserving all rights, etc.” The record further shows, upon the yellow tinged pages, that Mr. W. L. P. Little was made the auctioneer, and was instructed not to receive any bid less- than $2,500. On March 3d, forty eight years ago on Wednesday of this week, the auction took place, and the contract was “knocked down” to Asa Hill at $9,925. The work was commenced immediately, and the building completed in about a year. I

PROPOSITION FOR NEW COURT HOUSE 127 During this time, in the month of October, occurred the death of the con- tractor, Mr. Hill. This necessitated some changes, the result of which was an agreement between his bondsmen and the township board to go on and ﬁnish the building, This is a synopsis of how, when and by whom the old court house was erected. Since that time many varied scenes have been enacted beneath its roof. Its walls have looked down upon a court of law and justice, upon the disturbed atmosphere of a democratic or republican convention, upon public meetings called for the discussion of events of public importance, and lastly upon a scene of happiness and sociability such as the Kermis, held two or three months ago aﬂ’orded. A more ﬁtting scene for a building that for half a century had served the public, could not have been selected. Its outlines will always occupy a place in the minds of the citizens of this city. The subject of building a new court house was agitated for years before any movement of prominence was taken. The subject was brought to the notice of the board of supervisors by the members from East Saginaw, who. representing their city, liberally offered to build a $100,000 court house for the county if the people of the county would consent to the removal of the county seat to the other side of the river. The removal of the county seat, the people of this city, it is quite superﬂuous to say, would not hear to, but the citizens not willing to be outdone, immediately took action and through the council, made a similar offer to the board. that they would erect for the county a $100,000 court house. The proposition was considered by the board, and caused at the time some warm arguments from both sides. A vote decided, however, that Saginaw should have it. On March 14, 1882, the legislature passed an act enabling this city to issue bonds for a sum not exceeding $100,000 for the purpose above mentioned. On April 6, 1882, a special election was held to give the citizens of this city an opportunity to express their free opinion regarding the step about to be taken. The election resulted in 860 yeas and 52 nays. A contract was made between the city and the board of supervisors and the way seemed clear. But an entirely unlooked for obstacle soon arose. East Saginaw individuals seeing that Saginaw City was rapidly getting the best of the bargain, sued out an injunction restraining the further progress of the work. The litiga- tion that followed brought to light some irregularities which rendered void everything that had been transacted. On March 13, 1883. the legislature passed another act in the matter. On May 10, 1883. another election was held. which resulted in 'a vote of 350 to 37. The work was again taken up, the bonds were issued, the bids advertised‘for and a contract let to Dawson 8: Anderson at $92,713, upon plans drawn by architect F. W. Hollister. Mr.
Page 128
128 ' OLD RESIDENTS Hollister was also appointed by the committee as supervising architect. Ground was broken in September, 1883. The corner stone was laid with imposing ceremonies on the 28th of May, 1884. The stone occupies a con- spicuous position on the east corner of the court house. It is a ﬁne sand- stone block 37 inches square and 2-1 inches thick. It bears the inscription in old English letters, “Saginaw County Court House, A. D. 1884,” on one side, and on the other, “F. W. Hollister, architect; Dawson & Anderson, builders.” The plans and speciﬁcations as prepared by Mr. Hollister were carried out to the end, with but very few changes, and those of minor importance, and right here we wish to congratulate this genial and whole souled gentleman, upon the success he scored in drawing these plans. His plans have been per- fect and the representation of them that now occupies the most prominent block in the city is, we think, all that the citizens of this city could wish them to be. Since planning this ofﬁcial palace, Mr. Hollister has achieved many triumphs throughout the state of Michigan, among which may be men- tioned the capturing of the $1,000 prize for presenting the best prepared plans for the new “Soldiers’ Home.” Mr. Hollister also prepared the plans for the new Presbyterian church, recently dedicated, and also for the M. E. church. Several private residences ﬁnished and in progres also mark the popularity that ingenuity and sound ideas are bringing to this gentleman in his chosen profession. Mr. Hollister also drew the speciﬁcations for the furniture, of which mention shall be made further on. A full description of the building is too lengthy for the society’s reeords; yet it’s a very ﬁne and beautiful building, costing $112,000. , Mr. Asa Hill, spoken of as the contractor of the old court house of forty eight years ago, who died October, 1838, was brother-in-law of E. S. Wil- liams, they marrying sisters. Mrs. Hill, in after years, married Mr. Royal W. Jenny, of Flint, who died February 12, 1876, leaving a widow and two children, a son and daughter. Mrs. Jenny resides in Flint, and with her. the unmarried daughter. Her son is married, has two children, and resides in Walkerville, Ont. Mr. Jenny was born January 13, 1812. Mr. Jenny was proprietor and editor of the “Genesee Democrat,” which is still published in Flint. Mrs. Jenny is the only survivor of a large family that came to Michigan the spring of 1822 in the steamer Superior, her grandfather and wife, Mr. Janess Harrington,- her father and mother and four sisters and three brothers, herself making a family of eight children. Mr. Harrington purchased a farm of 160 acres near Auburn, Oakland (30.. a beautiful place, where he lived and died. He also purchased a tract of land of the government, in the township

Grandfather Harrington was born January 27, 1763,-and died Oct 13, 1825. He was a soldier of the Revolution seven years,_ most of the time with Gen. Washington's army. He married Martha Gould, in Vermont, March 13, 1785; who was born July 8, 1766, and died Oct., 1829, near the old homestead in Oakland county, at one of her granddaughter’s, Mrs. Horace Johnson. \ I INDIAN DEEDS OF REAL ESTATE [From the Detroit Evening News, May 5, 1885.] Miss Ouellette, of Windsor, is at work in the Wayne county register of deeds’ oﬂice making a transcript of the original deeds of land, dating from the Indian grants in 1770-76 to later dates. The old records are remarkably well preserved and the penmanship forms excellent specimens of chirography. The documents are in French, and the names appearing speak the antiquity of many of the families now prominent in Detroit. A number of the land grants made out by the aboriginal occupants of the soil are signed by the Indian chiefs, hieroglyphics taking the place of signature, the' settler or oﬂlcial writing the name underneath. One chief deeds a strip of land, and scratches what is supposed to represent the sum. Another chief, known as V "Kegon,” makes some wandering European happy by aﬂixing the ﬁgure of a ﬁsh to the conveyance of a strip of land. “McKaugh” scrawls the ﬁgure of a bear, while “Wawaskeisch” appends a ﬂyingdeer, suggestive of the ﬂeeting nature of the land claimed for centuries as his inheritance. “The curious often ask why the land in this vicinity was laid out in such narrow strips, running from one' to three miles back from the river,” remarked James A. Visger, deputy register of deeds. “The fact is the early settlers were afraid to separate themselves for fear of attack from their many foes. As a consequence they would negotiate with the chiefs for from 600 to 1.200 or 1,500 feet frontage on the river, running for miles back. This gave them suﬂicient territory, besides an equitable division of the river front, and secured them the advantage of mutual protection. The purchase price of 17 I

Frequently the transfers were the results of friendship without compensation.” “How do the records of Michigan lands interest the Canadian authorities?” “The deeds now being copied cover both sides of the river. The records were captured by the British in the war of 1812, and 'by a subsequent under- standing between the Canadian parliament and congress they were returned to Detroit, it being understood that our friends across the water should have access at any time to the documents.” EARLY HISTORY OF ELISHA IV. RUMSEY, ONE OF THE FOUNDERS OF ANN ARBOR BY A. D. P. VAN BUREN It may be well to state here the historic fact that Elisha Rumsey and John Allen, with their wives, both of whose [ﬁrst names were Ann, were the found- ers of Ann Arbor. The Elisha Ramsey of Ann Arbor fame was only known in his early life in New York as Walker Rumsey, having assumed the name Elisha after he came to Michigan. Why he changed his name the following letter from G. M. Peck to T. B. Lord, from whom I received most of this rem- iniscence, will explain. It is said now that Ramsey’s full name was Elisha Walker Rumsey: Eas'r BETHANY, N. Y., February 14, 1881. FRIEND Loan: Yours of the 26th of December was duly received. I was so busy that I did not get. posted in your matter for some time. Walker Rumsey was a resident of Bethany in 1817 (or before), and lived in a log house on the Joel Miner farm, near the “poppe tree" on the ridge south of the road. This poplar tree is thus accounted for: An old Indian stuck a cane, cut from a limb of a poplar tree, into the ground at this place, and it grew into this tree. The house was afterwards burnt. Rumsey then went. from there to the “Corners,” and you know his wife died there. In 1818 he bought wheat at 31 cents a bushel, had it ﬂoured at the Tomlin- son Mills, and shipped to Albany by a six horse team. The next. winter, 1818, he bought pork

In this way he became acquainted with Trotter 62 00.. the ﬁrm in Albany who bought his pork, and who sent him $3,000 to buy cattle with. He advertised for the farmers to bring in their cattle on speciﬁed days at the center of Bethany and Stafford, but he failed to appear. Some time before this his wife and he had become acquainted with Ann Sprague, a grass widow of prepossessing attractions. Now, Rumsey, after receiving the $3,000, went with Ann Sprague to Canada with his pockets full of money. After getting there he found, if caught in that coun- try, it would be worse for him than if caught in the states; hence, he now starts for Michigan. A young lawyer in Batsvia got wind of his movements, and went to Albany. Trotter came back with him, and they pursued and found Rumsey, and took him to Albany, leaving Ann in old Gen. Isaiah Churchill's home. On reaching Albany the matter was personally arranged, and Rumsey came back to Bethany. Soon after this he was rearrested, taken to Albany, and locked up again. Esquire Churchill went to Albany, and Runfsey, who owned the Taylor farm at the time, turned'that out, which, with Churchill's security, released him. After this he lived with Ann Sprague as his wife. Public opinion was so strong against both him and his wife that they pulled up and went to Michigan. Capt. Taylor, an old man now in his eightieth year. and from whom Mr. Peck got most of this sketch of Walker Ramsey’s early life, says that Ann Sprague was a smart, ﬁne looking woman, had lived in his home and was kind in caring for Mrs. Taylor while she was sick with the dropsy. Thus it turns out that Elisha Rumsey, one of the founders of Ann Arbor, was Walker Ramsey, of Bethany, Genesee county, N. Y., whose escapade with Ann Sprague we have given. Mr. T. B. Lord, now of Comstock, Kalamazoo county, had previously given the writer of this paper the same account of Walker Ramsey as Mr. Peck and Mr. Taylor have given in this letter. which they after- wards sent. by his request, to him. Mr. Lord also ays that Walker Ramsey’s brother Henry came to Michigan, and became surveyor general of the new territory. The writer of this sketch has not written it for any other purpose than to subserve the purposes of history in giving a faithful portrait of E. W. Rumsey, although we were compelled._as Cromwell compelled the artist, to “paint him, warts and all.” By Rumsey’s dropping the name Walker, which was in bad repute in New York, and assuming the name Elisha, he got out from under a cloud and had a clear sky in Michigan.

A MARRIAGE LICENSE ALL ABOUT A MARRIAGE LICENSE BY COL. HENRY RAYMOND The Tribune of Jan. 21, 1885, contains an interesting narrative of events by “Pioneer” that brings to mind a certain event of nearly the same period, somewhat in the same line, and the writer only regrets he does not possess the happy faculty of narration of “Pioneer.” ' . It was in 1832, the writer was resident in a very. sparsely settled town in Wayne county, and at a. township meeting had the honor of being elected town clerk. Not long subsequently be was called upon by a young, green looking fellow who demanded a marriage license, and was told that he did not require such a document. He, however, insisted that he did, for a min- ister had refused to marry him without and the license he must have. The ofﬁcial being green in ofﬁce. was not in his own mind positive that the fellow was not right. But what sort of a paper to make him next puzzled his brain. He had no idea what the law required in the way of examination of- the applicant, but proceeded thus: “What is your name?” “Joseph Streight.” “Your age?" “Seventeen.” “The woman’s name?” “Betsey Bates.” “Age?” “Thirty seven.” “When is the wedding to take place?” “Next Sunday.” “Well. I will make out the paper and leave it at the postoﬂlce for you Sat- urday. I must look at the law.” . “All right.” he says, “only be sure to do it.” The writer had a neighbor friend, who had been a justice of the peace; a comical fellow, who pretended to know more than he really did, but I went to him for counsel. Said I, “Is a man required to have a license from the
Page 133
THE LICENSE 133 town clerk to get married?” He beli ved there was such a law but did not think people paid much attention to if. “Well,” I said, “a. party has applied and insisted on having one and I don’t know the ﬁrst word of a form or what the law requires.” “0,” said he, “never mind that. You know that, here in the woods. if we want a thing and haven’t got it we make it, and I’ll help you make the thing.” After a good deal of racking of brains and waste of ink and paper the_fol- lowing comical document came forth, written in bold hand. covering a whole page of foolscap. (It was arranged that I should write what my friend dic- tated) : “In the name of the sovereign people of the territory of Michigan, and in accordance with the laws enacted by the government and council, and approved by the president of the United States of America; and “Whereas, one Joseph Streight proposes to marry one Betsey Bates, and the said people have sworn by the holy St. John and the big horn spoon there i no legal impediment to the contrary; "Now, therefore, this is to permit the said Joseph to be joined in holy wed- lock to the said Betsey, and may the Lord have mercy on his soul. “Given under my hand at M , this -- day of , 1832. R Clerk.” About twenty ﬁve years after the foregoing the writer was introduced in the corridor of the state house at Lansing, to Rev. Mr. B., of Albion. The reverend gentleman scanning the writer closely for a moment, said: “Are you Mr. R. who a long time since lived in the town of 11., Wayne county?” “I am.” "Was you town clerk?” “Yes, why?” “I was then just commencing to preach; was ﬁlling an appointment in a little log school house in what was known as the Mud street Settlement. 'After the service I was approached by a rustic lad with an application to perform the marriage ceremony. ‘Yes;’ I said. ‘if it is close by.’ ‘0,’ he replied, ‘my gal is here and we'll have the job done right now, and here is my license.’ Well, by the time I had read that unique document ( which I still keep and laugh over with my clerical brethren as a relic of 'pioneer days and its many crudities) and partially recovered from the convulsive laughter it occasioned, the parties came in and were duly spliced.” “Now, Mr. B.,” said I, “did you not preach your ﬁrst public sermon one warm summer day in the shade of some trees near the residence of a family by the name of Bird, in that same settlement?” “I think that is so.” “Yes, and I was present; thought you rather green but would improve by practice. Good day, elder!”

134 INDIAN SUPERSTITION LEGENDS OF INDIAN HISTORY IN SAGINAW VALLEY BY EPHBAIM S. WILLIAMS. OF FLINT I notice with pleasure an article upon the defeat and extermination of the Socks from the Saginaw country by the Chippewas and other tribes. which I have always understood to be the fact, and Saginaw derives its names from the fact of its having been the Socks’ country, the Indian name being Saw- gee-nong, meaning the Socks’ country. also ,as regards their superstitions and notions that the country they had captured from the Socks was haunted by the Muwe-soos or bad spirits of the Socks. or in their phrase. the bad Indians. I will give a little of my experience of twelve years’ residence among them. The fact is, they carried their fears and superstitions to a very great length and at many times to their very great loss of property. Many of their frights l have witnessed and have tried to persuade them otherwise, but to no pur- pose, they having so long been deluded. There was a time, every spring, when the Indians from Saginaw and the interior, would congregate in large parties upon the Saginaw bay for the pur- pose of putting up large quantities of dried sturgeon, which made a very delicate dih when properly cooked and was much 'used in those days, by the ﬁrst families in Detroit. At the Point Au Gres. so called in those days, being a shallow point making out into the bay. with a smooth limestone bottom, the sturgeon would run up the smooth point in large numbers,_working up until quite up shore, and lie like ﬂoating cord wood. The Indians camped here on the point and would select the best at their leisure, ﬂay them, hang them across poles in rows about four feet from the ground and the rows about two or three feet apart. Then a gentle smoke was kept under them until perfectly dry. A common sized sturgeon, when ﬂayed. would be about the size of an ordinary deer skin. When dry they were folded and packed in nice packages for keeping for their summer use and for market. About the time this is accomplished the JIu'n-e-soos. more properly poor. lazy. worthless Indians, would come from a distance. having an eye to supplying themselves
Page 135
THE MUN-E-SOOS , 135 with provisions they never labored to obtain. except by theft. They (the Socks) would now commence, in different ways, to excite their own fears that the Mime-8008 were about their camps, by ﬁring guns at night in the woods in the rear of their camps, and also dropping a certain painted kind of quills near their camps so the children and women would ﬁnd them. These were certain indications their enemies were near at hand. After a few nights, they became so frightened. they would take to their canoes and ﬂee, leaving many times almost everything they possessed. ﬂeeing for the Saginaw river. The .lI-un-c-soos or robbers would then rob their camps of what they wanted and escape to their homes. with perhaps their summer supplies of ﬁsh and often sugar and dried venison. They rarely if ever took any articles of prop- erty. as it might lead to discovery and detection. Being the time of year I usually made my annual trips along the bay and lake shore, looking after our spring trade and collection of furs, going as far as Thunder bay and looking after our trading post at the Sable river, where we kept three men during the winter, at these times I have often met them ﬂeeing as above mentioned, sometimes twenty or more canoes. I have stopped them and tried to induce them. to return, and we would go with them; but no, it was the Mun-e-soos, and nothing would convince them differently,- and away they would go frightened almost to death. I have visited their deserted camps at such times, gathered up their effects . that were left, and secured them in some one camp or lodge from the destruc- tion of wild animals. After a time they would return and save what was left. During these times they were perfectly miserable, actually afraid of their own shadow. At other times, having a little bad luck in trapping or hunting, they would become excited, and often say game has been over and 'in their traps and they don’t catch anything—have known them to go so far as to in- sist that a beaver or an otter has been in their traps and has gotten out, or was let out by the Mun-e-soos, or that their traps are bewitched or spell bound by the “bad Indians,” that their riﬂes have been charmed by the Mun-esoos and they can’t kill anything. Then they must give a great feast and have the medicine man or conjurer, and through his wise and dark performances the charm is removed, and all is well again; traps and riﬂes do their duty. and the poor beaver, otter, deer,vbear. etc., again suffer, much to the proﬁt of the traders and pleasure of the Indians. These things have been handed down for generations. I have had them come frequently miles, bringing their riﬂes to me, asking me to examine and re-sight them. declaring the sights had been moved, and in most instances they had ( but by themselves in their fright). I always did, when applied to. re-sight and try them until they would shoot correctly, and
Page 136
136 INDIANS AS MABKSMEN they would go away cheerful and 'thankful. I would tell them they must keep their riﬂe and traps where the .llun-c-soos could not ﬁnd them. They never forgot these little favors, but would bring me some choice present, such as beaver’s tails, which are a most delicate dish, and often a nice fat ham of venison. The reason for their coming to me was that I always kept a splendid riﬂe and was considered a good marksman. The young hunters would come and practice shooting at a mark with me. I»have spent hours in shooting with them. They thought it very strange I would beat them shooting off hand, and they always resting their riﬂes. I have practiced with hundreds of them and never found an Indian I could not beat at any distance. This fact made me quite popular with them. I have often attended their feasts by invitation. These are alway conducted with much solemnity, and the invited guest or guests are always seated at the head of the feast, and the head of the animal cooked for the feast is always placed in a dish before the guest. Sometimes it is a bear, deer, coon, or dog, a dog, being esteemed the greatest delicacy of them all. They usually at these feasts, after the table is cleared away, close with what is called a pouch dance, which is a very solemn attair, but very amusing to the invited guests, the guests never being allowed any part therein. I meant to have mentioned an incident, which was very amilsing. When the sturgeon run up on Point Au Gres as spoken of, some of them are very large and lie quite stupid. A young Indian, a little fellow, would wade in, straddle one of these, strike his tomahawk into its nose, and away the sturgeon goes full speed through the water, the young Indian guiding him by the . handle of the tomahawk until fatigued, then runs him ashore, to the amuse- ment of lookers on, the young fellow receiving many cheers. Some of these ﬁsh are very large, often weighing one hundred pounds or more. The Indian name for sturgeon is mon-e-mcg. In Mr. Williams’ “Personal Reminiscences,” in Vol. VIII of Pioneer Collections, he calls the evil s irits “manesous” and instead the Sock Indians, he calls them Sauks. In ng’s Chippewa vocabulary sturgeon is translated onnemay instead of mon-e-meg.

INDIAN TRAIL 137 REMEMBRANCES OF EARLY DAYS INDIANS AND AN INDIAN TRAIL—A TRIP FROM PONTIAC TO GRAND BLANC AND THE SAGINAWS BY EPHB-AIM S. WILLIAMS, OF FLINT In the days past and gone, as we traveled from Pontiac to Grand Blanc and Saginaw, following the only road, the long traveled Indian trail, over the beautiful oak openings being burned over by the Indians, perfectly clean, and in June covered with beautiful ﬂowers of almost all colors, it was like traveling through ﬂower gardens—there could scarcely be anything more pleasant and beautiful. The openings were in gentle rolling swells, and from those you could look for miles in many places over the country, like looking through extensive orchards, and see deer, often in herds from ten to ﬁfteen or twenty, feeding upon the acorns—nothing more beautiful. Now the deer are killed or driven back. the beautiful openings cultivated, converted into splendid farms, and more sad, the old pioneers of those days, who toiled and suffered many privations of pioneer life. are almost all gone to their rest, but such is life. Perhaps about half way, going towards the north, a few feet from the trail, were some very singular tracks, or what resembled tracks. The Indian legend was that an Indian warrior being shot on the brow of one of these ridges, ran down the slope, near the trail. making very long steps, or per- haps jumps, leaving deep impressions in the ground, the steps being from six to eight feet apart. Taking from seven to nine steps, then falling, his shoulder and hip made an impression in the ground. This was said to have been in some of the Indian wars, years and years before. These prints of feet and body were kept sacred by the Indians up to our day. They kept them free from leaves and clean for so many years they were worn down 18
Page 138
138 LEGENDS several inches. All Indians passing stopped and had certain ceremonies over them, and the young men would try and make the jumps from step to step. We almost always stopped and examined them. These steps and marks in the ground were preserved and kept as perfect as possible until the' country became settled and made into beautiful farms. A Mr. Brainerd, an earlyysettler in the town of Grand Blanc, wrote a sketch of some of his pioneer life. He speaks of these steps (I quote his words): “When about half way to Pontiac from Grand Blanc a- party of Indians were on their way to Detroit to engage in war. One Indian would. not consent to ﬁght on either side; of course he was shot. He reeled. and ran down the side of the trail, making nine tracks and falling upon his hip and shoulder. These were always called the ‘Indian nine tracks.’ I have been on the spot several times, and tried to go through the performance for the novelty of the thing. The trail and steps were quite deep, and the ‘nine tracks’ ‘were all very plain to' be seen in 1834.” I will mention another incident of an Indian legend which Mr. Brainerd mentions. He says: “There was a hole dug and stoned up, about four feet deep, and two feet or more across, one mile from my place, on the bank of Thread river. Report has it that in 1812 the Indians took a white man pris- oner at Detroit, and brought him out here. (lug and stoned up this hole, then placed the man in it and burned him. The stones show the effect of ﬁre. I have been at the place often; it could not have been dug for a well, for the Indians never take the trouble to dig for water.” Mr. Brainerd more than probably formed a wrong opinion of the stone well being made to burn a prisoner in. I think I can solve the problem more satisfactorily about the use of the well. I have seen many such places. The Indians dig them, stone them up, or throw stones in loose, then build heavy ﬁres in the pit, heating the stones as hot as possible. They then ﬁll the pit, over the heated stones. with a certain kind of roots, cover them over tight; the hot stones cook the roots, for several days, which prepares them for food. Some of these roots are very poisonous in their natural state, but after this cooking they make a safe and good food. This, I am satisﬁed from experience, was the use made of the well, instead of burning white men, as Mr. Brainerd says. I have eaten the roots spoken of, in the Indian camps, and they were very palatable. ' Many of our early settlers formed very strange ideas of the Indian charac- ter, and their doings, which has caused so many strange notions about the Indians by the early pioneers, and many of them have been handed down to the present time. I quote again from Mr. Brainerd: “In the spring of 1833, on the ﬁrst Monday in April, we held the ﬁrst '
Page 139
FIRST TOWN MEETING IN GRAND BLANC 139 \ township meeting, at the center of the town of Grand Blanc. at the house of Rufus Stevens. J. R. Smith oﬁfered a resolution: Resolved, that we call this township ‘Grand Blanc’ (carried). Norman Davison was now elected supervisor; Jeremiah R. Smith, township clerk; Lyman Stow, Rufus Stevens and Charles Butler, assessors.” (I wish to say here this Lyman Stow spoken of wa the ﬁrst postmaster in Flint. The mails were so small that Postmaster Stow carried the letters around in his hat and delivered them as he met his neighbors, and was looked upon as a great convenience.) “John Todd, Jonathan Dayton and Edmund Perry, commissioners of highways. The over seers of highways, district No. 1, George Oliver; No. 2, Jonathan Davison; N0. 3, Norman Davison; No. 4, Ira Dayton; four districts extending to Saginaw, Fentonville. Lapeer and Pontiac. At this town meeting an amus ing incident occurred. After the election was over one of the citizens being ﬁred by the results of the day and a portion of whisky, mounted his horse and rode upon the stoop of the house to bid as good bye. The ﬂoor of the stoop gave way and precipitated horse and rider into the cellar; the cellar extended under the stoop. All these adventures helped to cheer the path of~ the pioneer.” July 8, 1833, we held another election for delegate to Congress for the county of Oakland. Austin E. Wing received 42 votes, William Trowbridge one vote, Lucius Lyon, 12 votes. For member of the legislature. Thomas I. Drake received 51 votes. Grand Blanc bears off the palm of all towns in the county for her ﬁrst town meeting and county oﬂicers of the day. Mr. Brainerd continues: “This year, 1834, has been one of pain and sorrow for the pioneer in this part of Michigan. The spring seemed very backward. Emigration had become so great among us it settled our part of the town .fast; a good many log houses had to be built and I think it caused sickness. The houses were made of green logs, and in the summer the sap in the logs soured and smelled offensively in hot days. Living and sleeping in them I think caused much sickness, such as fever and ague and chill fever; :1 number died of fever this fall.” There were hardly well ones enough to take care of the sick; those days were truly discouraging. Mr. Brainerd says: “We had to send to Pontiac for all our groceries except a few articles. Soda for cake we made of cob ashes; our coffee is made out of burned bread; tea. ometimes out of sage leaves, and sometimes from sassafras root bark. Our sugar some of us made from our maple trees. Ginger we sent to Pontiac for, and often found it mixed with corn meal.” I will now continue my course towards Saginaw. Between Grand Blanc and Flint the Indian trail passed over a beautiful rise of ground, which the
Page 140
I40 BABso-QUAH G Indians had cleared and surrounded with plum trees. which bore any amount of wild plums, red and yellow, the ﬁnest I ever saw. This spot was, perhaps, forty or ﬁfty feet in diameter, the trail passing through nearly in the center of this beautiful, green grass spot, where all travelers, both white and Indian, stopped. The Indian always stopped, as it was a place of Indian worship. Beside the trail, nearly in the center of this spot. stood a very peculiarly shaped stone, perhaps four feet high, erectedby the Indians as one of their idols or gods. They called it Bab-o-quah. They never allowed themselves to pass this stone without stopping and talking a lingo with their god and having a good smoke from the red pipe of peace and friendship. This was always a matter of worship, and conducted with much solemnity on their part. As we journeyed to and from Saginaw we always arranged our time so as to stop, bait our ponies to the ﬁne grass and refresh ourselves from our lunch baskets, which we always carried well supplied, we having a. regular old fash- ioned pioneer sit down lunch party talk over, by telling some funny incident some of us had experienced. Talk of pioneer society meetings now a days! They are nothing to the enjoyment we took in those days, as I see it. In the early days of 1823-4 Capt. Jacob Stevens located and built a log house in Grand Blanc, one of the ﬁrst in the town, his son Rufus building the ﬁrst. Looking about for stone for the back of his ﬁre place (stone were very few and far between in those days), he came across the Indians’ Bab-o-quah, or their god of worship, loaded it on his stone boat, drew it home and placed it in the back of his ﬁre place. All went well for a time, but at last the Indi- ans missed their idol, Bab-o-quah, and were quite excited about the loss. Searching about, they discovered where it was. They at once appointed a delegation to wait upon the captain and insisted upon his returning Bab-o- quah to its original position, saying to him that he had committed almost an unpardonable offense, and nothing would answer but returning the stone. The captain and family were a little uneasy, fearing some ugly fellow might do some harm. He offered to pay them to let him keep it, but no, never“ would they sell their fancied god, and he was obliged to take the stone from his ﬁreplace and replace it where he found it, placing it in the same position, and at once. They named the captain from this transaction after the stone. Bab-o-quah, and he was known and went by that name as long as he lived and was known by that name throughout the land. The stone stood there after- wards until the land was purchased and made into farms. What became of it or who got Bab-o-quah I never knew, but presume some of the settlers got it and may have it still. If I ever knew the English of the word Bab-o-quah I have forgotten it. I will mention another incident in this connection. which has just come to
Page 141
TRIP TO SAGINAW 141 my mind. Sometime in the years 1836-37 or ’39, I don’t remember which, Col. David Stanard located on a farm on 'the Tittabawassee river. Mrs. Stanard and her daughter were in Pontiac on a visit, anxious to get home. Brother G. D. and myself were going to Pontiac with a double team on busi- ness. The Colonel wished we could bring his wife and daughter home with us. Mrs. Stanard applied to us at Pontiac, being anxious to get home, the winter being near its close. We said to Mrs. Stanard we feared we could not make it very comfortable for them, as we had about a load; she replied that she was anxious to get home, a it might be the last opportunity, as winter was about at an end. They would give us as little trouble as possible and could and would put up with all the inconveniences of the journey, having had some experience in settling in an early day on a farm near Pontiac, and keeping hotel in Pontiac in its earliest days. The Colonel’s family being old friends and neighbors. we were willing to make an effort to comply with their wishes. Mrs. Stanard and daughter were perfect ladies and some of the noblest women of those pioneer days, or any other days. We therefore decided to take them and do the best we could to make them comfortable. The ﬁrst night we stayed with my sister, Mrs. Rufus Stevens, at Grand Blanc. We started early the next morning, in hopes to get to Saginaw that day, but the sleighing not being good. we had to go slowly, night coming on when we were at what was then called Bird Run; now called County Line, a railroad station and quite a village with ﬁne farms surrounding. We drove up on to a little rise of ground that was covered with a young growth of pines; we cleared away the snow under the pines and laid down plenty of pine boughs for a bed fountain. We had plenty of bedding, Mrs. Stanard having pro- vided for an emergency of this kind, and with our own blankets we were well provided. Making a good ﬁre and keeping it through the night, we made the ladies very comfortable. They were jolly and enjoyed the trip very much. Mrs. Stanard got out the lunch 'baskets, which were well supplied, and pre- pared a ﬁne supper, which we all enjoyed after a hard day’s travel. After the evening’s chat, all retired, brother and myself keeping ﬁre. The ladies said- they rested very well. Next morning after taking breakfast we went on our way rejoicing and arrived at Saginaw before night. Col. Stanard had but the one daughter, a splendid young lady, who in after years became the wife of Morgan Drake, a lawyer in Pontiac, where they lived and died. I often think how would the ladies of the present day like such traveling as our wives and daughters went through with and were obliged to, summer and winter, camping out at all times. There was some pioneer life about this I think, yet they all enjoyed it. and had any amount of fun. The Colonel died, I think. on his farm on the Tittabawassee river; Mrs.
Page 142
142 EARLY DAYS IN SAGINAW Stanard and daughter returned to Pontiac, lived and, in after years, passed away. , This Tittabawassee river in early days was called Til’ﬁn river, named by the surveyors after Surveyor General Tiﬂ‘in, of Ohio. The early settlers, not pleased with the name, changed it to the Indian name, Ta-tu-ba-war-say, the meaning of which is the river running around the shore—as it does make otf around the Saginaw bay and Lake Huron. REMEMBRANCES OF EARLY DAYS IN SAGINAW IN 1833 BY EPHBAIM s. WILLIAMS, or FLINT In those days there lived in Saginaw City an old Indian trader (then re tired) by the name of John Baptiste Desnoyers. He became very-much excited over stories the Indians had told him over and over again, that there were copper mines, very rich ones, far up Pine river in Gratiot county. He had several pieces of native copper, which the Indians had given him, which they said they obtained from the rocks, and they said the place was a secret and they dare not inform the white man where it was, for the Great Spirit had enjoined upon them secrecy, under penalty of some severe punishment. But Desnoyers worked upon one who professed to know all the secret by promise of presents, and paying him well if it proved a success. Under a solemn promise that he. Desnoyers, would never tell who gave him the information, the Indian agreed to pilot and go with Desnoyers to a spot near where the copper was. He could not go to the place, for he would be struck down by the Good Spirit, yet he would go so near as to point out or tell where to ﬁnd the copper rock. After all this having been accomplished by Desnoyers in great secrecy, he came to me and gave me the secret as a conﬁdential friend, and proposed that I should join him in the enterprise, and we would make an exploration privately. I must say that I had very little faith in the story, knowing the Indian

LOOKING FOR COPPER 143 character and their strange ideas, but I could make the trip a business one. as we were going through a good country for trade with the Indians, there- fore I went prepared to trade. We made our arrangements and in a few days started in a canoe. with our wise Indian for a guide up the Ta-ta-ba-was- say to Forks. thence to Pine river. far above the present St. Louis, in Gratiot county, It was tedious, for the stream was quite rapid, but at last we came to high bluff banks and some little indications of rocks and gravelly shore. The banks were perhaps from twenty to thirty or forty feet high, the shore was about twenty to thirty feet wide and in about the centre of it there was a large boulder. As we drew near this place our Indian became very nervous and uneasy. manifesting some fear. ,As we landed here our Indian said that in the high bank was the copper mine, but he could not and would not go any farther. He lay in the canoe a little farther down the stream from where we landed. We then went up and examined the surroundings, but could not ﬁnd any indications or signs of mineral. We then examined the boulder and found it worn quite smooth by the Indians. It was a sacred Indian god, which they all stopped and worshiped by a speech and friendly smpke. They made speeches and left pieces of tobacco for the spirits to have a smoke. They also left other articles, and among them were pieces of copper. which we after- wards learned ‘were cut from the copper boulder on the Ontonagon river, Lake Superior, by Indians. They looked upon them as sacred, and by leaving the pieces they dedicated them to their god, Boulder, and this was one cause of our informant‘s being so fearful of his being known, for probably he was one who robbed their god. The Indians are very peculiar in such matters. standing in great fear of offending the Good Spirit. This was the foundation of his story and trick upon Desnoyers. ~ We explored the high land back from the river, but did not ﬁnd any rocks or indications of copper, but we found splendid farming land, which has since been converted into ﬁne farms. Thus ended our early exploration for copper on Pine river, yet I made it a proﬁtable trip, as I gathered many val- uable furs, going prepared for trade. These rivers, in those days. abounded with Indians and game. and the Indians were good hunters and trappers. So ended one of many silly Indian humbugs. Speaking of the copper boulder that was taken from Lake Superior and dedicated to the Washington monument by the State of Michigan, my father visited that boulder in very early days, even before the war of 1812. and he cut quite a piece of the pure native copper from it, and took it to his family in Concord, Massachusetts, before we moved west. I remember it very well; it was looked upon_as a great curiosity and wonder, hardly credible in th0se

Williams, late of Califor‘ nia, and James M. Williams, now living in California, and myself. On our arrival at the Sault Ste. Marie we purchased a good beat, well equipped with oars, sails, etc., with a good tent and plenty of supplies, and started to coast it up Lake Superior, a jolly crew. The Sault canal was being excavated. and a steamer was being hauled across the portage from the head of the rap- ids into Lake Superior. She was then near to being launched into Lake Su- perior, but she was having some trouble, and was delayed several days. This steamboat was built at Black Rock or Buffalo by a Mr. Palmer. She was built and rigged as a full rigged brig, a beautiful vessel and the only brig on the lake at the time. Not proving a success as a brig she was made into a steamboat and named the Julia Palmer. I think she was named in honor of Mrs. Palmer, wife of the owner. We left and coasted as far as the Ontonagon river, stopping at all the points of interest, such as Eagle River, Eagle Harbor, and all the then mining point of interest. We encountered several heavy winds that we could not stand, always making for land, endeavoring to make some outlet of a small stream down the mountains, where we found splendid trout ﬁshing, and we enjoyed catching the beautiful little fellows. They would take the bait about as fast as we could take care of them. The months of these little runs down the mountains would be dammed up with sand that was washed up by the winds, forming little ponds that were full of trout; our bait was a small piece of white pork, and we often took a hundred trout in a very short time. While two ﬁshed, two cooked and kept camp, taking turn- about. As we left the Ontonagon river on our way down, after a while we saw down the lake in the distance what we supposed was the steamer Julia Palmer, steaming for the ﬁrst time up the lake for Copper Harbor. We were rejoiced to see her, for we were about tired of coasting. Giving three cheers for the Julia Palmer, we put in our best energies to get to Eagle Harbor be- fore night, supposing the Julia Palmer would leave the next morning for the Sault, which she did, and we sold our boat and took passage down on our way home on board the ﬁrst steamboat that was ever on Lake Superior. There were several passengers on board and we requested the captain to run down by the Pictured Rocks, which he did. it being a beautiful, bright after- noon. The view of the rocks was beautiful beyond description. On our passage down the lake we passed near to and the spot was pointed out to us

PLACES AND PEOPLE 145 where Dr. Douglass Houghton-was drowned. I felt sad, very, for I was inti- ' mately acquainted with him; he was with us much of the time at Saginaw when he was locating the salt well for the state at Salt Spring on the Ta-ta- ba-was-say. Messrs. G. D. 8: E. S. Williams took the contract and made the brick for the well. The doctor often-urged us to use our mill steam power for boring a salt well near the mill at the foot of Mackinac street, city of Saginaw, he pointing to the spot to bore, saying we were in just the best place to strike the salt basin, which in after years proved so, and was and is now worked by the Williams Brothers, sons of Gardner D. Williams. They manufacture from one hundred to one hundred and ﬁfty barrels per day, using the surplus steam from their saw mill. In the years 1836, ’37 and ’38 we had living with us in Saginaw a gentle- man and his family, consisting of his wife and two beautiful daughters, by the name of Joseph J. Malden, formerly'a sea captain. The captain and. his family were very much esteemed and respected. Mrs. Malden was a good, motherly, lovely woman; the daughters were married in Saginaw; the eldest was married to James Busby, one to a Mr. Beach, and the other to a. Mr. Palmer. Mr. Palmer established a tannery, the ﬁrst in Saginaw. In a few years he died, and at about the same time-Mrs. Malden died. Both were much missed in our little settlement. The captain remained with us a few years; he received the appointment of light house keeper at the Island of Mackinac, Mrs. Palmer went with her father to Mackinac and kept house for him, and the last I knew of the captain he was at the Mackinac lighthouse. He subsequently became blind'and died about 1880 at Alpena. In 1861 I visited the captain and his daughter while we were stopping at the Mission house on the island for a few days. ' In after years the city procured and located a ﬁne cemetery ground above the city and the citizens purchased lots; all who had been buried in past years were removed to the cemetery; Mr. Palmer and Mrs. Malden were removed. On attempting to raise the casket of Mrs. Malden, it was found that it could not be raised by the ordinary means; a power was provided to raise the casket, and upon examination it was found that the body had become petreﬁed to solid stone and was just as natural in looks as it was on the day she died, not a particle of change. This was a very singular incident, as no other body' in the same ground, even near Mrs. Malden’s, was so changed. Mrs. Malden in life was a ﬂeshy woman, weighing probably, 175 or 200 pounds. In 1836 Mr. Palmer went to New York on business, and while there he bought a very ﬁne gold, English lever capped watch, paying for it one hundred 19
Page 146
146 THE OLD WATCH and twenty dollars. After his return and while erecting his tannery build- ings and putting down his tan vats. he found it was costing more than he had expected. He then proposed to me to trade watches, saying be rather have more lumber and not quite so much watch. I had an English lever watch with the works similar to his, but in silver cases; it cost me forty ﬁve or ﬁfty dollars; we traded and I paid the difference in lumber. My reason for speaking of this is that I have the same watch now and I have carried it since the year 1836 (fifty years) and it has always been and still is a faith- ful old friend, but it will not run on railroad time, or wrongly called I think. standard time. I concluded to let my clock run on old solar time. and as I was around among our town’s people, and the city had adopted railroad time. I would start my old companion watch of ﬁfty years on standard time. To 'my surprise after a day or two my old friend stopped; I thought nothing, but started it again. The next day it stopped again, struck, perhaps, for better time. I tried it again, but at twelve o’clock in the day or night it would stop. I thought it strange, so I said, now my dear old friend, I will not ask you to do that I dislike to do myself and I cannot approve of. so I set the old fellow on the good old solar time, God’s time, and I have had no trouble since, except that it runs a little slow, like its master. Perhaps you may think this is a little mixed. but it is true. and I assure you that the old watch and myself are pretty good friends and much attached to each other. The cases of this watch of ﬁfty years are as bright and perfect as most of the new ones of the present day. [The following lines were composed by my old esteemed friend, Capt. Joe. I. Maiden, Saginaw City, 1838, while suﬂ'ering'under the horrors of fever and ague, and addressed to the malignant spirit supposed by the writer to preside over it.] Avaunt, gaunt ﬁend, why, wicked demon, why' Comest thou again on me thy art to try?

INDIAN REMINISCENCES OF 'CALHOUN AND KALAMAZOO ' COUNTIES COLLECTED AND CONTRIBUTED BY A. D. P. VAN BUBEN CALHOUN COUNTY The Indians that formerly occupied Michigan were of the Algonquin family. The larger branch called Ojibways or Chippewas inhabited the northern part of the peninsula; the Ottawas. the region south of them. The Pottawattomies occupied the lower part of the peninsula and spoke one of the rudest dialects of the Algonquin language. In 1822 there were ﬁve thou- 'sand six hundredand sixty nine Ojibways at Saginaw. Since 1800 the Pot- tawattomies have inhabited the lower part of the Michigan territory, living in scattered bands independent of each other. And as they are the only Indians connected with the early history of central Michigan our narrative hides with them. There are but meager traces of antiquity, and no trace of government among

148 MA-GUA-GO—MAR-CHEE them. The Chippewas and the Ottawas Were under British inﬂuence during the war of 1812. The Pottawattomies were friendly to the American cause. . These three tribes ceded all their lands about Lake Superior to the United States, and removed south of the Missouri river. In 1870 there were four thousand nine hundred and twenty six Indians in Michigan. In 1874 there were only sixty Pottawattomies of the Huron band in this state. They lived in a rude hamlet situated on a patrimony of one hundred and sixty acres of original timbered land in the southern part of Calhoun county near Nottawa Sepe Prairie on which was formerly located the Nottawa Mission. The Methodist Episcopal church established this mis- sion here in 1840, when they built a large log structure for a mission house, and a smaller one for a school house. The dwellings were of poles laid up' like a log house, and covered with shakes. Rev. Manassah Hickey, now of Detroit, assisted by his sister and a young man by the name of Crane, had control of this mission and school. After Sau-au-quet’s death John Ma-gau-go' aspired to the chieftancy of the Pottawattomie nation. He was a man of noble bearing, and was succeed- ed in 1833 by his son John, whom most of the early settlers in this part of the state well remember. He became chief of the Michigan band, and was in the full sense a most noble specimen of his own race. In 1838 or ’39 the grand council of the Indians was held in the Indian Reserve school house. and Muck-moot was present. There were then assembled ﬁve hundred of this tribe. John Ma-gua-go had three sons, Man-do-ka, Mo-qua and Me-mie. That they were agile and muscular in all physicial sports, and good wrestlers, many of the early settlers’ sons can testify. Mar-chee was the chief’s sister; or Mar-chee-o-no-qua was her full Indian name. She was said to have been a beautiful woman in her younger days and preserved traces of it long in her old age. Her second husband was Capt. Hatch, the Indian trader. They parted. and she married Buel Holcomb, known as “Bue” Holcomb, with whom she lived many years, and they separated. Mar-chee the writer knew well. She was the medicine woman among her people, and the doctoress in many families in the white settlement on Dry Prairie and the region about the mission. I have often met her at Isham Simond’s hospitable home on Dry Prairie. where she was usually called in case of sickness of any of the inmates. and where she was esteemed highly, not only for her skill as *The chiefs of this band, beginning with the settlement of the whites here have been Pierre Mon-eau, an accomplished Frenchman, who married an Indian woman and spent his after life With the Pottawattomies as their chief: Cush-ee—wzu: and Pee-quail-nh-kiss-ee were legitimate chiefs, but were supplanted by Mm'reau and his son, Sau-au-quctte, who virtually governed the band; the former till he died a poor drunken wretch, the latter till he was assassinated at Colon, st.

A SERVICE IN ENGLISH AND INDIAN 149 doctoress, but for many virtues of a good Indian woman. And I remem- ber Pont-sig-na, Mar-chee's daughter, by her Indian husband. Pont-sig-na was a beautiful young girl—the dusky belle of the forest. As I saw her one Sabbath morning walkirg in the open wood near the rude village gathering wild ﬂowers, she recalled these lines of Scott: “And ne’er did Grecian chisel trace A nymph, a naiad, or a grace Of ﬁner form and lovelier face. * a * * a: * * s A foot more light, a step more true, Ne'er from the heath ﬂower dashed the dew." Pont-sig-na was educated at Albion and died before she was twenty years old. MARY Rev. Manassah Hickey, as we have said, was the pastor of this little ﬂock, had his home with them, as did Miss Hickey and Mr. Crane. Mary, the wife of Man-do-ka, was the interpretess. She had been educated at Albion. She was an intelligent, comely Indian woman of some thirty years of age. One Sabbath morning, in the spring of 1847, I had gone with a party of young men and ladies from the school district north of the mission, where I was teaching to attend church with the Indians. We had got there early, and going into the log chapel seated ourselves and waited the gathering of the dusky congregation. Soon a young Indian came in, and taking down'a long tin horn that hung behind the door, he stepped out in front of the chapel and wound it so loudly and musically that we could hear the twang- - ing notes peal out, whisk oil? and die away in the distant arcades of the forest. Repeating this two or three times he stepped back into the chapel and hung up his born again. Soon these children of the forest began to assemble in the rude log church. Quietly, with the careful Indian tread, old and young came in and took seats. Some half hour later the Indian who had given the ﬁrst summons to church on the horn took the instrument, and, stepping in front of the door, wound it as he had done before. The ﬂock all assembled, Hickey took his stand by a small table, and Mary took seat in a chair by his side, ready for her work. They had hymn books and the New Testament, I belie\'e,-in the Indian language. To hear these quiet worshipers sing-— “Oh, for a thousand tongues to sing My great Redeeiner‘s praise," in the Pottawattomie language, with its liquid accent and beautiful mono- .syllabic distinctness, when uttered by Indian lips, was a great pleasure to us.
Page 150
I50 AN INDIAN ORATOR An Indian once said to Hickey, “White man don’t sing that hymn right. Indian would sing: ‘Oh, for ten thousand tongues to sing 53: .5 In My great Redeemer’s praise. - After the hymns and the prayer, Mr. Hickey began his sermon. He would deliver a sentence in English and then pause till Mary repeated it _ to the Indians in their own tongue. It was very interesting to us to sit in that room whose quiet seemed like the stillness 0f the forest about us. Very inter- esting, I say, to listen to Hickey’s sonorous voice, as be pronounced his ser- mon, paragraph at a time in distinct English. and then listen to the same sermon given forth again paragraph after paragraph by Mary’s musical voice, in the beautiful Indian language. As Hickey became animated, or emotional, his interpretess would also, until, at times her feelings would so overpower her, that her head would fall back against the wall, her voice grow weaker and weaker, till her lips would move with no audible sound. Hickey would then stop till Mary revived, when he would go on as before. Of the two sermons, his to the whites in English, and Mary’s to the Potto- wattomies in. Indian, I think Mary’s was the most effective. She had the best listeners, and then her Indian words as they left her lips went more effectually to the hearts of her audience than Hickey’s did to his, because the Indians are more gifted as listeners. From the old patriarch of eighty years, to the lit- tle Indian boy or girl. they seemed to feel that they were in the house of God. The very moment that they entered the door of the chapel, worship began. They Were in the presence of their Creator. They are worshipers to “the manor born.” ‘ “mo-sHA” There was, at this time, living at the mission, an Indian from the far west called the “Mississippi Indian.” This was Mo-sha. By those who admired his speaking he was called the “Mississippi orator.” “He that only hears Demosthenes loses the better part of the oration.” We could not understand what he said. but we saw and heard Mo-sha, and in his manner and action we thought he evinced much of the orator. Surely the Demosthenic test of making action the principal thing in oratory would have made Mo-sha an orator. We. at least, found Indian delivery‘admirable. No public speaker was more distinct in elocution than Mo-sha. He spoke the pure Indian with an articulation and modulation that was faultless, and his gesture was just what the word naturally required. He followed the instruction of a great master—“suit the action to the word. the word to the action.” Although we understood scarcely a word of what he said, yet we were so interested in

SARAH—M UNG-WOO- DANS 151 him while he was speaking that we were sorry when he took his seat. What was it that held us as with a spell? “'Twas the charm of delivery—the magical art That thrills like a kiss from the lip to the heart." Here, thought I, is a model for some of these “Boanerges” in the pulpit. who, not only “tear a passion to tatters.” but tear their words into fragments and drive their meaning out of the minds of their hearers. Mary left her husband, Man-do-ka, and went with another Indian to Canada. Mo-sha died 'a few years later at the mission. ' SARAH, THE SISTER OF MARY Mary had a sister named Sarah, who was also educated at Albion, I am in- formed. Sarah belonged to the “Slater Mission,” which was located near Gull Prairie. in Barry county. She was, I believe, interpretess, for Rev. Leonard Slater at the above named mission. Sarah was much more accom- plished in education and the graces of our schools and society than Mary was. She was younger, and like Mary, was comely, but a more attractive Indian woman. Mung-woo-dans was chief of a western tribe of Indians far towards the Rocky mountains. Sarah was one of the Indian party with which Mung-woo- dans had made the tour of Europe. On their return to this country I met these tourists at Battle Creek. This was in the summer of 1853 or ’54, I think I never saw a nobler specimen of mankind than this Indian chief. He was tricked off in true Indian warrior style. His head gear was of eagle’s feathers; around his neck and hanging over his shoulders was a broad neck- lace of grizzly bear’s claws. As he walked the streets of Battle Creek all eyes were upon him. What a splendid highland chief he would have been. Scott could have said of him—— “And if thou said'st I am not peer To any lord in Scotland here, Lowland or highland, far or near, Lord Angus thou hast lied." I He lectured in the evening to the citizens of Battle Creek, in the old Univer- salist church. He said there was such a throng crowded about them, in some of the cities on the continent, that they dared not go into the streets» They visited Louis Phillipe in Paris, and other kings in Europe; also Queen Vic- toria in London. He lost two of his children while in Europe. He was not an orator, though a forcible and pleasant speaker, and exhibited some char- acteristics of Indian oratory in his distinct elocution, ﬁne modulation of
Page 152
152 ' STORM cnoun voice and impressive delivery. The party stopped at the old Battle Creek house.‘ Prof. Copeland of Detroit, at that time, had one of the square rooms on the second ﬂoor for an art gallery, whose walls were hung with his beauti- ful monochromatic paintings. He was the ﬁrst to introduce crayon paintings in Battle Creek. A lady from Boston, stopping at the Battle Creek house, was delighted with Sarah, the Pottawattomie tourist. As they passed by the art gallery I invited them in. They were both much pleased with the paint- ings. I asked the Boston lady which of them she considered the ﬁnest'. .She pointed to Diodate, Byron’s home in Geneva. This was a beautiful work of art. I then asked Sarah the same question. She immediately pointed to a wild winter scene in the woods called “The Bear on the Ice.” This was characteristic of the race to which she belonged; nature had more charms for Sarah; while on the other hand a ﬁne work of art had won the lady from Boston, as art had more charms for her and her race. REV. HENRY JACKSON, 0R “STORM CLOUD” Bam-me-no-de-no-kaid, signifying storm cloud, came here from Canada, where he was born, brought up and educated as a Wesleyan Methodist. He was government interpreter and business agent for the Pottawattomies. He was highly esteemed by the Indians at the Nottawa mission. He did not live here, only came when business required. His home was with the Ottawas at Wayland, Allegan county. Jackson was a Chippewa and has lectured at Battle Creek on the “Manners and Customs of the Chippewas.” He was better acquainted with the history and traditions of the Indians in Michigan than any other person in the State. And it is greatly to be regretted that these histories and traditions were not secured by the State Pioneer Society before his death. He became dissipated some time before he died. He died at Holland a number of years ago. He was a forcible speaker, earnest and pathetic in his appeals to his red brethren. While he was with this mission he was a very useful man, and had he lived and remained in the work he began he would have been of great use to his race. KALAMAZOO COUNTY [Read at the Annual Pioneer Reunion of Kalamazoo county, held at Vicksburg, August 5, 1885.] Mr. George Torrey, secretary of the association, then presented his annual sncas'raay’s REPORT \ Pioneers, Lndics and Gentlemen: Once again we meet in this part of the county and for the third time, to
Page 153
SECRETARY’S REPORT 153 \ hold our annual reunion and picnic, and to hear the voices of pioneers in song or story of the olden time, to meet long separated friends and acquaint- ances of former times, to look each other in the face, to grasp hands that have grown harder and more wrinkled since they used to meet more often in friendly clasp, to talk over the days that are no more, the scenes that are vanished except in memory, and to recall the form, and the face, and the character of friends who have gone before—a happy privilege, indeed, vouchsafed us. Owing to the fact that so many other meetings were in progress last season, and a heated political canvass being at its height, the.usual annual reunion was postponed, much to the disappointment of many. It is the only year since 1871, when the society was organized in Kalamazoo, that a meeting has not been held, and every gathering has grown larger and larger and seemed to be more and more enjoyed. But the circumstances were such last season as fully warranted the postponement. This year while the ofﬁcers of the society were discussing where to hold the meeting, a very kind and cordial invitation was received from the ofﬁcers of the harvest home festival to meet with them at this place, conveying with their kind message the assurance that the pioneers would be well cared for. We knew that, for we were acquainted with the great hearted oﬁ‘lcers of that association and those who were members thereof; we did not parley a mo- ment, but accepted, very happy to be with them. This gathering, therefore, will have less the features of a. distinctive pioneer reunion than those hereto- fore held, though on a former occasion here the meeting was of a union character and a very delightful one, except its termination was a drenching rain storm. Since we last met. two years ago, at Galesburg, in that pleasant grove by the river, death has been very busy with members of this society and pioneers of the county, prominent for good work, and leading citizens of the county, among these the noblest and best the county has ever known. As I call the names of many of-these it will be unnecessary to pass a eulogy upon them or to tell you who they were. Personally they were known to nearly all of you ; you have many a time grasped them by the hand in cordial fellowship. You have met them in business circles, on social and friendly occasions, in patriotic, philanthropic, benevolent and christian enterprises for years past. You have often heard the voices of some of them, at our pioneer reunions. and you have listened with pleasure to their utterances. Their names are associated with leading events in our history, both county and state, and among them are those who have sat down with princes, statesmen, judges, ' and the great men of the nation and of the world. I need not recall the 20

154 SECRETARY'S REPORT tall and majestic form of Judge IVells, who never failed to be at a pioneer picnic and contribute to its, chief interest by his inimitable and always attractive powers as a historian and story teller. Where could be found his equal in depicting the characteristics of noted pioneers; yea, the very form and color of those times? I know of no one that could match him. How greatly we miss his presence to-day. There was Wm. G. Dewing, the great hearted philanthropist, oneof the fathers of the pioneer society, of whose virtues and work I might speak for an hour without exhausting the theme. Allen Potter, whose name is a synonym for all that is worthy and good; John Millham, the sturdy farmer and honest man, whose word was as good as his note, and his experience and skill as a farmer was worth a mint to others as well as himself; Martin Turner, the ingenious and ever ready mechanic and millwright, generous friend and neighbor, who as a farmer and artisan has from the ﬁrst contributed so much to the development and prosperity of the county; Horace Phelps, another builder up, and in every ﬁbre a noble man; Alexander Buell, Elon G. Huntington, Henry S. Parker, Lucius L. Clark. for nearly ﬁfty years a leading merchant and man of many friends; Capt. R. C. Dennison, the genial and generous hearted citizen, soldier in the war and provost marshal at the time of the draft; Robert S. Babcock, merchant and banker; William Skinner, the well known farmer of Cooper; Chas. S. d’Arcambal. for over 30 years druggist in Kalamazoo; Mr. Gage of Texas; Willard Dodge, Caleb Sweetland, David Sergeant, and many others. They have passed from the stage of action to the sphere of rest and reward. But they have a place in our memory that can never be eﬂ'aced. ' The secretary would feel that the many pioneer women who have lived and have done so much in the work of making this county what it is, who have so often met with us and have contributed so greatly to the pleasure and interest of these meetings were worthy of honorable mention, but unfor- tunately I have but an incomplete list of these mothers in Israel. We hope at a future meeting to speak of them and place their names upon our pioneer record. At the annual meeting of the society held in Kalamazoo, March 8th, a quorum being present, it was voted to amend the constitution so that the election of ofﬁcers should take place at the annual reunion instead of at the winter meeting as heretofore. I would suggest, therefore, that it would be in order to appoint a committee from those here assembled, without any for- malities, to submit the names of proper persons to act as ofﬁcers of this society for the ensuing year. Hon. Stephen F. Brown was then called upon, and though surprisedand

‘ "INDIAN" JOHNSON 155 unprepared he made the most of his opportunity, and for ﬁfteen minutes he held the closest attention of his audience. Five little girls then sang “Bye Bye Baby, Bye Bye,” and were loudly applauded. ' A committee consisting of Mr. J. Lemon, Mr. J. M. Neasmith. Mr. A. D. P. VanBuren, Mr. Hackett, Mr. G. F. Brown. was appointed to nominate officers of the society for re-election. Mr. A. D. P. VanBuren then delivered the following carefully prepared and valuable papers: THE “mums” JOHNSON, AND sorm or THE ro'r'rawxrroma BANDS TO WHICH HE BELONGED The following sketch of the life of “Indian” Johnson I got' from the old pioneer, William Harrison, of Climax, who not only knew Johnson, but was well acquainted with, and had lived for years a neighbor to his father, John Johnson, in Shelbyville, Shelby county, Kentucky. When William Harrison, or “Uncle Billy," as he was familiarly called, came to Climax in 1830. he found among the Indians here this white man called Indian Johnson. He had four wives, and was a. man of importance among the Pottawattomies in this region. ['ncle Billy’s log cabin. on Climax, was a kind of a rude Mecca, to which his early friends here, the Indians, were accustomed to resort with offerings of berries, maple sugar, venison, and so forth. He was' always on good terms with them, and says that he and his family would have starved in those early days when they could ﬁnd nothing to “browse on." had it not been for the kindness of their Pottawattomie neighbors. He was always a favorite with them, so much so that they named him Sam-okay-ma- co. which means the good man. Among his particular Indian acquaintances were four brothers. Sam-o-ka, who had been a petty chief in his tribe, Not-a- wa. Pe-ash~y and Pe-ne-moo. These names and many others of the old Pot- tawattomie band were as familiar as household words to the early settlers in Climax and the region about it. chle Billy soon found that Johnson was a white man, and strongly suspected that he was of the Kentucky family above mentioned. He wrote to his old neighbor, John Johnson, at Shelby- ville, who sent two of his other sons to Climax, where they found their long lost brother—a complete Indian in all but his having been born a white child. The facts in his life are as follows:' Two of Johnson’s children had been stolen many years before from his home in Shelbyville, Kentucky, and no trace of them had ever been found. One was quite a lad. the other an infant in the cradle. whom his Indian captors must have killed. as he was never seen or heard of afterwards. The lad was kept and had thus been reared by the Indians. .
Page 156
156 INDIANS AS NEIGHBORS Johnson, having been identiﬁed by his brothers, went back' with them to his “old Kentucky home.” But he was now more Indian than white man, and, after staying some years or so, he came back to his forest home in Michi- gan, where he died some years afterwards. Pe-ne-moo's squaw was Johnson’s daughter. Johnson would never join the Indians in their pow-wows, but on such occasions he would-come to his friend’s, Uncle Billy’s, home. Mrs. Dr. L. W. Lovell informed the writer that Johnson at times in his talk with the settlers seemed to feel the full sense of his lost manhood, that he was now, as compared with the whites, an inferior person—an underling. And a feeling of sadness would come over him as he would say: “Me not Indian. Me born white. Me white man.” Sam-o-ka, and Johnson as interpreter, came to Stephen Eldred, Climax, with the bitter complaint that “Che-moka-man had killed their dog.” .The Indian dogs would kill the settlers’ pigs, and then the settler shot the Indian dog, whereupon the owner of the dogs would come to the white man claim- ing from twenty to thirty dollars for every dog killed. Mr. Eldred, 0n the occasion referred to, told Sam-o-ka and Johnson that unless they kept their dogs from killing his pigs he would report them to the Indian agent at Detroit, and they would get no more presents from the government. There was no more annoyance, says Mr. E., of this kind. But the Indian were generally what might be called good, accommodating neighbors. Says Mrs. L. W. Lovell: I"We could not have done without the Indians. They were our marketmen and women. They brought us venison, huckleberries, maple sugar and many other things that we in a new settlement needed.” Pe-ne moo had a patch of land on Major Lovell‘s farm that he for many seasons cultivated. Here he raised corn. beans, pumpkins, and other vegetables; his wife, Johnson’s daughter, being half white, seemed to have more energy and thrift than the other squaws. She was a member of the M. E. church, and a few years ago colnmuned with its members at Climax. At the time of the removal of the Indians westward by the Government, Sam-o-ka and most of the Pottawattomie band known here went to Canada. Says Judge Eldred; “While I was at the ‘corners’ a few years ago, a squaw came up to me, apparently much pleased, as she held out her hand and exclaimed, ‘pr do you do, Judge Eldred, don’t you know me? Me Pe-ne-moo‘s squaw!” The Judge was very happy, he said, to meet this good Indian woman. She and her husband- had returned from Canada. About this time Not-a-wa, who also had returned from Canada, met an old settler on Climax. The old Indian seemed to be sad and melancholy as he aid: “Me remember when it was all woods about this place. Plenty of deer, plenty of hunting, plenty of Indian here then. All gone now. Me go, too, soon!” Pam-pla-pee, another

SAM-O-KA AND UNCLE BILLY 157 of this old band of Pottawattomies, remembered he said, when the dry marsh, or rather clayey land, north of McNary‘s, in LeRoy, was a large lake abound- ing in ﬁsh. He had caught ﬁsh there many times. Sam-o-ka never came back from Canada. Some few years ago one of his tribe informed the writer that the old chief, or, as he was accustomed to say when a little squiby, “Me, Sam-o-ko-ma-co, cheep,” was yet alive in Canada, and he was a good Indian, and he had a very ﬁne squaw. But now they are gone—all gone— those old familiar acquaintances and helpful friends of the early settlers of this region. The Indians were friends and very kind neighbors to the early settlers. They treated us so much like kith and kin, that we called them our “country cousins”. And although extremely back'woodish in habit and mode of living. yet we could not wish for kinder and more accommodating neighbors. To use an Indian simile, “the smoke from the wigwam ascending upward united with the smoke ascending from the white man’s cabin, into one volume. So white man and Indian became one in friendship.” The Indians were often of great help at raisings; a log house or barn could‘not, at times, have been raised without their aid. One day Sam-o-ka came to a logging bee at our neighborJonathan Austin’s clearing in Battle Creek township. “Uncle Billy” Harrison, as the old Indian came to the clearing, remarked, “an Indian will drink all the whiskey you give him. I will prove it.” So pouring into a pint basin, the only drinking cup the settler had, over a gill of whiskey, the old chief drank it off without breathing. Billy then ﬁlled the basin nearly half full, which the ' old fellow swallowed and smacking his lips said, “Me like’m squibee.” He soon began to reel and was taken and laid under an oak tree, where he slept all the afternoon. Towards nightfall he got up and took the trail for his wigwam. - Uncle Billy’s son Jerry, like his father, had the strength and muscle of an athlete in wrestling, jumping or “pulling sticks.” While the young Indian boys were as lithe and agile as panthers at all athletic sports, Jerry could gen- erally “down them” at a “back bold,” but at a “rough and tumble,” the lndian’s “foot was on his native heath,” and there he usually came 06? victor. Among the Indian playmates of Jerry were Pe-nemoo‘s sons, whose friend- ship for him continued till his death a few years ago. After Jerry was mar- ried these friends of his boyhood would each summer spend a week or two with him. The following incident is so illustrative of an Indian trait that we give it here: A son of Pe-ne-moo had informed Uncle Billy that he was about to get married. “Then you come here with your wife.” says Billy, “and I kill
Page 158
158 NOONDAY, THE OTTA\VA CHIEF dog; make big feast for you.” This was agreed to. During the "bridal tour” to their friend’s home on Climax, young Pe-nemoo and his wife camped in the woods over night near a settler’s clearing. In the morning the young In- dian’s ﬁne broadcloth coat was missing, and could not be found. On reaching Billy’s hospitable home the story of losing the coat was told, and that “a che-moke-a-man had stolen it,” for Pene~moo had traced out the thief, who was the settler living near where they had slept over night. The latter de- nied taking the coat; and drove the Indian off. This excited a pirit of re- venge in the Indian, and nothing but revenge could now satisfy him. Says he to his friend, “Me kill him for stealing Indian’ coat.” Uncle Billy was alarmed, for he knew Indian revenge would ﬁnd satisfaction, and that young Pe-ne-moo would kill this settler. Consequently he replied, "You must not kill che-mo-ko-man. Me tell you what to do. He got fat hog. Steal ’em hog; that is better. Hog worth more than coat.” Billy found this the der- nier resort. The Indian followed his advice, stole the hog, and thus the set- tler’s life was saved. ' woonnAY, THE o'r'mws cums. HE WAS in THE BA’I'I‘LE or THE mamas. ' AND ssns COL. n. M. JOHNSON SHOOT 'rscumsan, wnom HE canams orr 'rm: BATTLE FIELD Rev. Leonard Slater established a mission among the Indians at Grand Rapids sometime in 1826. Here he ﬁrst met the Ottawa chief. Noonday. . And it was here that the old chief was converted to christianity some time in 1830 or ’31, with a number of other Indians of his tribe. Deacon Edwin Mason, of Richland, from whom I received most of the facts in this sketch. ﬁrst saw the chief Noonday, in 1832, on Gull prairie, as he. with his Indians, was on his _way to Malden to get their annual presents. The early settlers of Gull prairie were then just in the midst of the excitement over the rumors that Black Hawk and his Indians were coming into Michigan to murder them all. Deacon Mason had a talk with Noonday and among other thing asked him which side he would take in case Black Hawk did come into the terri- tory. He replied: “Me and my Indians will help the white folks if they need u.” Mr. Slater established his mission in Prairieville, Barry county, some one and one half miles from Richland, in 1836. He bought several hundred acres of land of Luther Hill for the use of the Indians. Deacon M remembers that in November of 1832 Elder Merrill came on horseback to his log cabin inquiring the way to Grand Rapids, whither he was going to organ- ize a Baptist church. and to baptize Noonday and the converted Indians. The elder on his return told Deacon M— that he had to sleep in the

0 HIS INTEREST IN MISSION WORK 159 woods one night both going to and coming from Grand Rapids. Noonday was an old man long before he came to Gull. He occasionally visited the settlement on the prairie, but was always the same taciturn. digniﬁed, com- manding person. Though the settlers now and then talked with him, through an interpreter, few of them knew that he had ever done an act that had caught the ear of fame. Yet the redman’s Clio. the penless scribe tradition, whose function was to keep alive the memory of famous deeds, had often told the braves around the council ﬁre, and they had told their children that Noonday had fought bravely on the British side in one of the memorable battles of our second war with England. It is well known that both the Chippewa and Ottawa tribes fought with the English in the war of 1812. Noonday had a wife and family. After his conversion he lived a true chri- tian life, never failing to hold family worship, gathering all the inmates of his household about the family altar morning and evening. I do not know whether he had children of his own. but he had several adopted children. He took great interest in the mission work, and especially in the school in which. through his inﬂuence, all the children of his tribe were gathered. He was looked upon by all his people not only as their counsellor, but as the wise patriarch who was to look after their temporal and spiritual wants. Miss Susan Parker, Amasa Parker’s sister, was the ﬁrst teacher in thi school which was organized in 1838. She'afterwards married Rev. Mr. Davis, and died at Ann Arbor, a number of years ago. The next teacher was Rev. Leonard Slater’s daughter, Frances, who became the wife of Cornelius Mason. She, too, is dead. Noonday. when visiting the school. would never let a wrong or improper act go unrebuked or unpunished, often chastising a refractory pupil for the teacher. Mr. Slater always preached to the Indians in their language, with which he had made himelf familiar. He had early sought- instruction from Noonday in the Ottawa dialect. He would ﬁrst deliver his sermon to the old chief, in order to get his criticism as to its correct Indian. before he preached it to the rude worshipers in the chapel. The mission lasted some ten years. Noonday died when some one hundred years old in 1845 or ’46, and is buried near the spot where the old mission house stood. A plain slab marks the grave where the old patriarch of the Slater mission sleeps. His wife at her death was laid beside him. Noonday never learned to talk English, but always spoke to his white friends through an interpreter, who usually was Mr. Slater. From an article by D. B. Cook, editor of the Niles Mirror, published in the Century Magazine of June. 1885, I get the following historical facts concerning Noonday: Mr. Cook’s father, Phineas Cook. was an early settler in the region near Gull
Page 160
166 NOONDAY AT THE BATTLE OF THE THAMES prairie. He says: “I had in 1838 an interview with Noonday, chief of the Ottawa tribe. The chief was six feet high. broad shouldered, well propor- tioned, with broad, high cheek bones, piercing black eyes, and coarse black hair which hung down on his shoulders. He possessed wonderful muscular power. He was converted to christianity by Rev. Leonard Slater, Missionary at the Slater mission at Grand Rapids, and afterwards came with his friend and pastor t0 the new mission near Gull prairie. Noonday was at the battle of the Thames.” Mr. Cook’s diary runs thus: “After rehearsing the speech which Tecumseh made to his warriors previous to the engagement. and how all felt that they fought to defend Tecumseh more than for the British, he was asked: “Were you near Tecumseh when he fell?” “Yes, directly on his right.” “Who killed him?” “Richard M. Johnson.” “Give us the circumstances.” “He was on a horse and the horse fell over a log, and Tecumseh with uplifted tomahawk, was'about to dispatch him. when he drew a pistol from his holster and shot him in the breast and he fell dead on his face. I seized him at once and with the assistance of Saginaw, bore him from the ﬁeld. When he fell the Indians stopped ﬁghting and the battle ended. We laid him down on a blanket in a wigwam, and we all wept, we loved him so much. I took his hat and tomahawk.” “Where are they now?” “I have his tomahawk and Saginaw his hat.” “Could I get them?” “No; Indian keep them.” A “How do you know it was Johnson who killed him?” “General Cass took me to see the Great Father, Van Buren, at Washing- ton. I went to the great Wigwam, and when I went in I saw the same man I see in battle. the same man I see kill Tecumseh. I had never seen him since, but I knew it was him. I look him in the face and said: ‘Kene kin-a-poo Tecumseh,’ ” that is, you kill Tecumseh. Johnson replied that he never knew who it was, but a powerful Indian approached him and he shot him with his pistol. “That was Tecumseh; I see you do it.” Noonday ﬁnished his story of Tecumseh by telling of his noble traits, the tears meanwhile trickling down his cheeks. There is no doubt of the truth of his unvarnished tale. ' - It was believed by some people that Noonday was at the burning of Buffalo. But Rev. Leonard Slater’s son George, now living in Richland, assures us
Page 161
NOONDAY AT THE BURNING OF BUFFALO 161 that Noonday told him just before his death that he was not at the burning of Buffalo. Wash-ta succeeded Noonday as chief of the tribe; but in a short. time after the chief’s death he went north with the few Indians at the old mission. Lewis Gen-ro' was an Indian well known on Gull prairie at this time. He, when living at Grand Rapids, had been sent to state’s prison for “holding his wife’s father in the ﬁre till he burned to death.” This was done when Gen-r0 was drunk. After serving his time in prison he came to Gull prairie. He had learned the shoemaker’s trade in prison. Rev. L. Slater built him a shop, and furnished him with an outﬁt for his trade. But, Indian like, he worked by ﬁts and starts, and ﬁnally went north with' the rest of his band. NOONDAY, THE OTTAWA CHIEF, WAS AT THE BURNING 0F BUFFALO In a previous article on this subject published in vol. 9 of these collections, it was claimed that Noonday was not at the burning of Buffalo; that the old chief had persistently asserted this to be a fact. Since then the writer has .got fresh information from Mr. Joseph Merriman, now of Yorkville, this county, who settled on Gull prairie in 1836, and lived for many years near neighbor to both Rev. Leonard Slater and Noonday. He was intimately acquainted with both. And he assured the writer that Mr. Slater had told him that Noonday had given him the correct story of his life, and that he was at the burning of Buffalo. But he had enjoined the utmost secrecy in regard to it upon Mr. Slater, as he feared that those who were injured by the burning of Buffalo might yet seek revenge on him. And furthermore it was a deed that he had repented of, and were it known among the people here it would create a bobble about him and would prejudice many against him. Mr. Slater kept his word, and not till after Noonday’s death did he divulge this fact. Mr. Merriman is positive that the above statement is true. And he is too well known for sterling integrity of character by his old friends 'here for any one to doubt the truth of what he says in this matter. ' I In a public “talk” that Noonday had, in an early day, with the people of Gull, he was asked what side he would take if there should be war with the ‘Gen-ro was said to have been half French ; he talked En lish about as well as the settlers. He was a power- ful man, fullydnx feet in height and well proportioned. e had "offered to bet. that he could whip or throw an man in lamazoo county." No one accepted his challenge. H. B. Brownell. now of Galesburg. then Iivmg on Gull prairie, had wrestled with Gen-r0 at “side hold" manv times. And when Brownell had his choice of hold, he threw Gen-r0: but if the Indian had his choice, he t rew Brownell. Hence between them, at “side hold, ' it was a “Roland and an Oliver." Gen-r0 was not a bad man, but. was always feared when he had been drinking. 21

162 OLD “SHE-MOKE" English or Indians again. He_ replied, “With you. You need not fear me or my tribe.” He said the English had promised them if they would join them in battle they would always aid them when they needed help—furnish them support through life. “But,” said the old chief, “they have not kept their word. They never did anything for us after we had done so much for them. We know you to be our true friends, and we shall always be yours.” Noonday was very much affected by the fact that the landlord at Prairie- ville was selling liquor to the Indians. The Indian agent, who then lived at Detroit, hearing of this, urged the people on Gull prairie to prosecute all such violations of the law. Mr. Merriman soon afterwards had this landlord arrested for the offense. But he pleaded so stoutly for mercy that Mr. Merri- man and Mr. Slater. who assisted him in the prosecution, settled with him on his pledging himself under oath that he would not sell any more liquor to the Indians. Immediately after the landlord was set at liberty he arrested both Mr. Slater and Merriman with a criminal warrant and had them put in the jail at Hastings on the ground that they had no legal right to settle with him—that the court before which he was arraigned was the only authority to have decided his case. The arrested parties remained in jail over night. Mr. Slater the next day got himself bailed out. He then went home and in a few days got his friend out on bail. But the trial was yet to come. When the circuit court met at Hastings Mr. Merriman received a note from Judge Ransom requesting him to call on his boarding place in Hastings. Mr. Merriman did so, and was told by the judge, who had got the facts in the case, that he could go home as soon as he pleased, for, says he. “I shall not allow your. case to be called. and that will put a Iquietus on the whole matter.” ow “sun-Mons” An old Indian who belonged to a band who lived south of Gull prairie had become well known to the settlers and had won their friendship by many a kind act. Some of his white friends had given him a new suit of clothes. It was a very amusing sight to see the old fellow, when completely dressed, in a full white man’s costume. After scanning himself all over from head to foot he extended his arm, felt of the sleeve, stuck out his foot, felt of his pantaloons, took off his hat, surveyed it, placed in on his head, and, suddenly giving a jump some three feet from the ground, uttered a wild whoop and exclaimed—“She-mo-ko-manI” “Me, She-mo-ko-man!” After that he went by the name of “Old She-moke.” Mrs. Elihu Mills, being in feeble health, had expressed a desire for some ﬁsh. She-moke having heard it took his spear and started for the “Three

INDIANS IN KALAMAZOO COUNTY 163 Lakes,” in the south part of Richland. In'less than two hours he was at Mr. Elihu Mills’ door and presented Mrs. Mills with a large pickerel. He speared it in the day time, no one could tell how, but an Indian could do many things wonderful to a white man. THE OLD INDIAN noc'ron There was an old Indian doctor well known by the ﬁrst settlers in the east part of this county. His name we could not get. His home was originally near Schoolcraft. He died in the spring of 1833 and was buried in what was later known as the Catholic burying ground in Kalamazoo. His,two sens were Cop‘mo-sa and Chip-e-wa. He had a daughter who was deaf and dumb. She married a Frenchman by the name of Joseph Mouseau, who lived with the Indians as a trader. They had a son who was a bright boy. Hugh M- Shafter. who gave this bit of history to the writer, visited the Indian camp, which was located on the lands now owned by A. L. Rowland, in Charleston. Mr. Shaffer asked Mouseau if his boy could speak French. He straightened up proudly as he replied—“He speak’em ma-jash English. he speak‘em Indian, he speak’em French.” Then turning to his deaf and dumb squaw wife, he said—“She no speak’em, but she good.”~ Of the old doctor’s family two died with the consumption; one called the “little oneeyed squaw,” says Esquire Shaffer, “was a smart little thing.” INDIANS IN KALAMAZOO COUNTY The following letter from A. H. Scott, dated St. Joseph, Mich., Jan. 5), is to Mr. Henry Bishop, and is in answer to questions touching the Indians in this county at an early day. It will be found of great interest to many of our readers to whom the aborigines of this section were unknown: “Your letter, dated Dec. 25, came to hand and I have felt it a duty to give the information desired in regard to the Indians of Kalamazoo county dur- ing the years .of its ﬁrst settlement by the whites as far as my memory will serve me. I came to Kalamazoo county early in June. 1833, as a member of the family of James Smith, in company with his brother Addison; Hosea B. Huston and E. Lakin Brown, carried on the merchandising business under the name of Smith, Huston & 00., and had two ,stores. one at School- craft. and the other at Kalamazoo (or rather Bronson, as it was then called). I soon picked up enough of the Indian language to enable me to trade with them. They then owned a reservation of land ten miles square, which took
Page 164
164 ATTITUDE TOWARDS EARLY SETTLERS in the eastern part of Gourdneck prairie, and had a small village or collec- tion of wigwams in the grove just east of the prairie 0n the farm now owned by James N. Neasmith, Esq. The wigwams were all built. with a frame of poles, covered with elm bark, with the exception of the wigwam of the chief (Sag-a-maw). which was built for him by his friends, the early white settlers, of logs and covered with oak shakes. You wish me to inform you how they received the ﬁrst settlers. how they lived and how they mingled with and how they traded with the white man. 1st. I think as a class 'they received the early settlers very kindly and nvere inclined to live peaceably with them. 2d. How they lived? Deer were plenty in those early days and as they were good hunters they had no difﬁculty the greater part of the year in sup~ plying themselves with meat. Tliey also used the ﬂesh of raccoons. muskrats, etc., for food. Fish were plenty in the rivers and lakes. They understood how to catch them both with spear and hook. They raised some corn on land that some of the early settlers plowed and fenced for them. In their season wild fruits. such as blueberries. blackberries, etc., were obtained by them for food, and also to swap with the white man for ﬂour, salt, sugar, etc. ’ 3d. _ How much they mingled with the white man? In our stores and in the dwellings and cabins of their acquaintances they made themselves very much at home. The squaws and pappooses would come in in crowds and sit down on the ﬂoor (never taking a chair) till they were so thick that you could hardly ﬁnd a place to put your foot. They turned out on muses on all public days and at horse races and shows. They were greatly delighted with cir- cuses. Shooting matches and foot races they took a great interest in. 4th. How they traded with the white man? The trade with the Indian at that early day was mainly an exchange (or, as they called it “swap”) of their furs, venison. dressed deer skins, moccasins, blueberries, blackberries, cranberries, etc., for ﬂour. salt, tobacco, powder. lead. sugar and all the articles that the Indians use to clothe themselves. I never knew an Indian to offer to sell to white people any part of the carcass of a deer except the ham. The price for a ham of venison was always two shillings; no more. no less, no matter how small or large it was. Whenever we sold a squaw any goods that had to be made up into any of their garments a needle and thread for each garment must be given; only the goods for one garment would be bought or swapped for at a time. It required a good knowledge of their ways and much patience to be a successful dealer with the Indians. We fre- quently sold them goods on credit and found them about the same kind of paymasters as the ordinary white man; some paid promptly. some after a
Page 165
INFLUENCE OF WHITES 165 long time. and some never paid. They would have been splendid customers if they had been blessed with plenty of money; but they were poor and thriftless, and I may with. truth say a “vagabond race" and consequently their trade was of no great value. They received an annual payment from government, which was mainly in necessary goods for their use and comfort, and a small amount of silver money. The money was very soon gone and in most cases did them no good. but the goods furnished them by government were just what they needed. and added greatly to their comfort. In regard to personal characteristics of any noted Indian, etc.. I would say that the best specimen of an Indian that I ever saw in those early days was Sag-a-maw. the chief of all the Pottawattomies in and about Kalamazoo county. He was a man of great good sense, of noble bearing. of great integrity, and in every way a digniﬁed gentleman. He was called a great orator among his people. He was a true friend to the whites. I have heard him make speeches to his people, and although I could not understand him, his manner and voice were very interesting, and the eﬂr'ect of his speech on his people was very great. He was the only Indian I ever saw who was polite and attentive to his squaw. When they came to the store at Schoolcraft to do their trading he would help her off her pony, and when they were ready to return he would place his hand on the ground by the side of her pony and she would place one foot in it and he would lift her with apparently great ease into her saddle, and no white man could have shown more respect and po- liteness. If he wished for any credit at the store he had it and paid promptly. Any Indian that he told us it was safe to trust was sure to pay us. He always told us never to trust his son Cha-na-ba, who was a very w0rthless fel- low. " ' In regard to the number of the Indians that lived in Kalamazoo county and vicinity in that early day. I can make no estimate that would be of any value. They were continually coming and going and scattered about in little squads. In regard to the effect it had on the char- acter of the Indian in his contact with the white race I have no doubt but it was bad. . He seems (as many writers have said) to take in all the vices of the white man and reject all his virtues. Whiskey (the great demoralizer of the white man) was and is the principal factor in the destruction of all that is good in the Indian character when he comes in contact with the white race. The longer the Indians remained here among the whites the more worthless they became. Game became scarce, they were too indolent to work, and they be- came drunkards and beggars. The great end and aim of the most of them was to get whiskey to get drunk with. and as its cost was only about twenty ﬁve cents per gallon they generally got all that they wanted. When they
Page 166
l 66 POKAGON purchased whiskey they usually announced that they were going to get squibby (drunk). The quality of the whiskey sold to the Indians was very bad, having been ﬁrst watered and drugged for their especial use. I recollect in 1833 that some Indians came to Schoolcraft from Kalamazoo and made bitter complaint to Addison Smith about H. B. Huston. They said that he put so much bish (water) in his whiskey that it made them sick before they could get squibby (drunk). As to myself I sold no whiskey to Indians except during the ﬁrst two or three years after my arrival in Schoolcraft. What I have said about the Indians has been mainly about those whose headquarters were near Schoolcraft. If you can glean any item out of thisvdisjointed and lengthy letter that will aid in making up a true history of the early settlement of Kalamazoo county I shall feel well paid for what little trouble I have had in writing it. But I very much doubt if you can, as there are other persons still living in Kalamazoo county who were familiar with all the facts that I have attempted to set forth. ’ E. L-akin Brown came to Schoolcraft two years before I came, and is very well posted in all the ways of the Indians of those early days. Mrs. Thad- deus Smith came to Schoolcraft in 1830 I believe, and could speak the Indian language better than any white person that I knew when I came there. She was a great favorite with the Indians. and any day that they were in town you would usually ﬁnd her sitting room ﬁlled with squaws and pap- pooses. Thanking you for your kind Christmas greeting, I must close by subscribing myself your old friend.”—A. B. Scott, in, Kalamazoo Telegraph. DAILY LIFE, MANNERS, AND CUSTOMS OF THE INDIANS IN KALAMAZOO COUNTY Below we give another interesting and valuable paper from the pen of Mrs. St. John“ regarding the Indians of this portion of Michigan the tribes who owned and for hundreds of years inhabited and dominated over these happy hunting grounds: 1. Pokagon was the principal Pottawattomie chief in 1827. I remember one Pottawattomie chief who was called Blackskin and my brother (George) says he remembers of a chief or under chief called VVhitefac-e being probably of a mixture of French blood. I am unable to say just what form of govern- ment the Pottawattomies‘had among themselves, but I suppose it was much like that of the Ottawas. When any important matter concerned the tribe *Daughter of Rev. L. Slater.
Page 167
TRIBES COMPARED 167 or any differences too heavy to settle between persons, the chief called a council of head men who sat round in a circle, smoked tobacco and talked one at a time, while others occasionally gave short exclamations of assent or surprise or dissent or grunts of attention till the matter was discussed, and generally ended by agreeing with the chief. It has been said by many that Indians are slow and stolid; that they were quick tempered, and when partially intoxicated would often stab each other ( men and-women). They all carried knives in sheaths hung to the belt. The knife blade was about seven inches long and turned back a little at the point and sharp. The United States government took notice of crimes committed among the Indians whenever such were perpetrated within the jurisdiction of the mission. Louis Geneau, an Indian, when drunk, pushed his wife? into the ﬁre; he was tried and sent to Jackson prison for life. \Vhile there he was asked how long he would have to stay. He replied, “All time. spose.” He was afterwards pardoned out. There were a number of chiefs at the same time. Father writes of three coming together once to the mission house to confer on some subject. 2. I think the Ottawas were superior to the Pottawattomies; ﬁrst, in their dialect. It was a relief to hear the musical completeness of the Ottawa’s speech after the labored pantomime of the Pottawattomie. Their darker skins and wilder Indian ways, I know, prove nothing; but we count that man the wisest who makes choice of the best things. The Pottawattomie tribe was probably superior in numbers and bodily vigor. ' - 3._ The Ottawas and other Indians lived in small communities or villages of wigwams of ten or a dozen or more, of poles sharpened and driven in the ground and fastened at the top by withes or strips of ,bark. They fastened strips of bark from pole to pole around the sides which made a sort of frame to hold the covering of bark, skins or matting, with an oblong mat hung over a doorway, and an Indian would dart through head ﬁrst as quick and noise- lessly as a fox might. A ﬁre built in the middle would ﬁll the wigwam with smoke until the blaze would drive it out at the open top. I often wondered why the concern did not take ﬁre at the top, but the inmates would fearlessly build a brisk ﬁre of sticks without seeming to care for the smoke and when the wood had burned down to bright, clean coals and the women had made some dough of meal or ﬂour and put it in the hot ashes, and the kettle of sturgeon, or partridge. or coon simmered, then was the time to begin a big talk of the adventures of the day. And if it was winter or wet weather the deer skin moccasins were taken off and stretched out and dried and the wide tDeacon Edwin Mason, of Richlsnd, says it was his wife’s father. II. B.

168 INDIAN WOMEN AND CHILDREN woolen bandages gathered around the foot for stockings, were hung round to dry for the next day, when the hoe must be again kneaded or rubbed to make it soft. The other parts of their dress have been truly pictured in Indian books. They soon found that our kind of dress was the best and adopted it; not caring to go back to their old costume, even though they would not “civ- ilize.” ' The routine of life among the women was by necessity very simple. In early times the garments were made with few stitches. but ﬁtted and fastened to the body by strings of deer skin. A pappoose cradle was a board with a sort of binding of soft, ﬁne bark around the edge, with open work sufﬁcient to pass a wide swaddling band round the knees and over the whole for the chest,‘ and then a hoop or bow over the face, so that a blanket might hang loose to protect the little face from rain and wind. The mother carried it from place to place by a strong band across the forehead backward. Some times, when they came to the chapel, they would stand them up along the wall, like so many umbrellas. There was no lack of affectionate care for the little ones. When they worried or cried the mother quickly went and loosened their harness, or took them and stood the board up beside them. The women were accustomed to be very valuable servants to their husbands, and on this account, if for nothing more, were esteemed and loved very much. the same as among the light skinned lords of creation. As to the courtships 0f the young people. it seems to me there was not much. In the absence of the elaborate customs of civil life. those suspicions and doubts which haunt the minds of young civilians were set aside. and the young Indian told his desires to the party of the second part, and if she was agreeable they both agreed. The children were taught those things which their parents thought were indispensable to success as an Indian. First of all, perhaps, to' ride a pony and shoot with a bow, and it was a great practice among the boys to run and jump at a mark. The children were under law to venerate parents and superiors, to obey and wait upon them. They were punished in no systematized manner. Parents would shake, or push, or cuff the ears, but it was a right jealously held by the parents, and if the father thought his child had in any wise been insulted or punished at school he was quickly on hand to see about it. I think that: wives were fully up to the standard of these times in domestic truth. When there were evidences of improprie‘ties they were paler faces. and such were always held under a ‘kind of scorn. I never heard of any polygamy among the tribes, but my personal knowl- edge of practices were mostly conﬁned to our own mission. The tendencies were all the other way. Each husband had a pride in providing for his

Some of the christian Indians told father that years before there were some of the tribe who were so heathenish as to take more than one wife. ' 4. They loved deeds of kindness done towards themselves. and would re- member them and return the favor if they ever had an opportunity, and so it was counted no shame to beg,v and when they came into any house hungry, they 'would say: “Howe-shum-bo-shin, quas-quis chebuckatah,” give me bread, very hungry. One Sabbath morning, chief Noonday brought his adopted son to the mission school saying: “This is the morning that the Savior rose from the dead, and I wish to do something in memory of Him.” They seemed to be chary' of speaking much of their traditions and superstitions in the presence of the white teachers whom they acknowledged to be superior in knowledge, and were shy of criticism. Their minds seemed sharpened only to those things which were good in their daily life. They could take ﬁsh with a wooden spear split at the end, and would boil ﬁsh in a tray. They imagined when they died the (great) “Gitchie-Manitou” would give them what they most desired while in life, but they must love him while here to be blest hereafter. Once. in the hard, cold winter of 1827, when the snow lay deep on all the land, the hunters could ﬁnd but little game, and the hungry tribe came begging round the mission. Some of them killed a bear; upon the good news the people assembled and roasted him for a feast; but, before eating, one of the chiefs made an address, which some one said was to the Manitou, thanking him for sending them that food just at that time. I think the Indians, in their native state, had no profanity. That was reserved for the white man to teach them. ‘ Their moral code partook 0f the crude simplicity of their minds; to love and do good to their friends and kill their enemies. Sometimes, when drunk, they would come to kill father. One was sick and sent for father to come and cure him, but gave him to understand that if the medicine did not cure him he would kill him. Their idea seemed to be to get even with every one; good for good, evil for evil; nothing was harder for them than to forgive their own injuries. I cannot say what festivals they had in early days, other than war-dances and medicine-dances. These last consisted in making as much and as horrible a noise as they could with dry gourd shells with a few pebbles in them, and a kind of drum made of deer skin shrunk over a hoop or how. When these two were struck together and the medicine musicians grunted and chanted and _ yelled in chorus, imagine the noise if you can. A year they called a sun, a month was a moon. They knew no weeks, and when the missionaries began 22

LUI. J.'. in Kalamazoo Telegraph. INDIAN COUNCIL [From the White Pigeon Republican, Aug. 28, 1839.] At. a council held at Notawassippi, St. Joseph county, Michigan, on the 20th inst., between Isaac S. Ketchum, agent. on behalf of the United States and the remaining Indians in the states of Michigan and Indiana, of the Pot- tawattomie tribe, Red Bird, a chief, addressed the agent as follows: Father: . You have waited with patience for us to come to the council and most of us are now here. We are happy to meet you all Well; ourselves and our children are all well. To day we have dry ground, a bright sun and a clear sky, and the Great Spirit be with us. We are now ready to hear you, and to-morro'w by 10 o’clock we will be ready to answer you. Mr. Ketchum then addressed them as follows: Chiefs and Warriors: . It is true that we have waited some time for the purpose of meeting you in council, and I am gratiﬁed to see you assembled. The object of this coun- cil originates from a treaty concluded between ourselves and the government of the United States. at Chicago, known by the name of the Chicago treaty. in which it was stipulated that you should give up peaceable possession of the lands ceded to the government of the United States, within three years from the ratiﬁcation of that treaty, and remove west of the Mississippi river, upon lands that were ceded to you in that treaty by the government. Your Great Father has had several councils with you to carry this into effect. at no small '

ADDRESS TO THE CHIEFS 171 expense, and you have deferred carrying that part of the treaty into eﬁect. He now wants these lands for his white children. Your Great Father, the President of the United States, has sent me here fully authorized (here Mr. Ketchum produced his authority) to convene you in council and to ascertain whether you are now ready, or when you will be ready to carry that part of the treaty into effect. It is speciﬁed that the expenses of moving you to your new homes should be paid by the government of the United States, and not out of your annuities, as you were informed by some bad birds, and further, the government is bound to furnish you provisions for one year after yOur arrival at your new homes. The government is now ready to perform its part. I am also instructed to give you a history of your lands west .of the Mississippi. The description I shall give you must be of a second hand nature, as I have never seen that part of the country, but it is from such sources that it can be relied on with the utmost conﬁdence. The face of the country, as reported, is prairie openings and heavy timb’er, well watered with ﬁne. rapid stream, ﬁlled with plenty of ﬁsh. The timbered lands are generally the same as here and the prairie also, and an abundance of game, such as deer, otter, muskrat, mink, etc., etc., and wild fowl of all kinds, such as turkeys, geese, ducks, prairie hens, etc., etc. The soil produces corn, potatoes, melons, etc., and in fact it is generally acknowledged by all white men who have seen it that it is better than this country and is very healthy. Now if you go there you can enjoy all these things and you will be on your own lands and not be tres- passers. Here you are not on your own lands and are committing trespasses daily, and you will not be troubled with the whites. You will also get the annuities due and coming due to you. If you remain here you cannot expect one dollar to be paid to you, for it is particularly speciﬁed in that treaty that no annuities should be paid you east of the Mississippi. Your Great Father is determined to carry out his part of that treaty. It is therefore hoped you will be as willing on your part and to come to such conclusion that he will be satisﬁed, for he is your well wisher and knows that you would be much better 01! on your own lands than you are here. After consultation among them, Muckmote, another chief. addressed Mr. Ketchum as follows: Father: We have held our consultation with the three nations, and what you said to us yesterday does not please us at all. You told us that we must go west of the Mississippi. In our former councils we always said we would not go, and our minds have not changed yet. At the council at Niles the same question was put to us and we said we would not go. You also wished to know when we would be ready to go. We say again. we will not go. We
Page 172
172 DECISION OF THE COUNCIL ' wish to die where our forefathers died. We have also been informed that the government would protect us. Yes, it will protect us while on our way west, but when we get there we are left to our own destruction. and there is not one of us that is so daring as to go. We are very poor. and one of our nation came back from there and told us that there was no bark to build lodges with, and our women and children would be obliged to live in tents, and it. is well known that we are not able to build houses like your white children. Now, there are a great many Whites that want us to stay here. They hunt with us and we divide the game, and when we hunt together and get tired we can go to the white men’s houses and stay. We wish to stay among the whites, and we wish to be connected with them, and therefore we will not go. Here Mr. Ketchum addressed them as follows: I You say the whites want you to remain 'here. Now, to show you that you are wrong in your impression, I will put the question to them and they shall signify the same by the uplifted hand. (So the question was put to a large assembly of whites, when every one lifted up their hands.) Now, sirs, you . see that the white men want you to go. I still think that you had better re- - consider the answer you gave to me, and carry that article of the treaty into effect, for your Great Father thinks you will be better off there than you are here. You say that you are poor,'and I have no doubt of it, and the longer you stay here the poorer you will get. If you go west, you will, as I before stated, participate in the annuities, and that will afford you some relief. and I have no doubt but that you will prosper. Then Red Bird said: Father, you have heard our decision: we shall never go. The reason the whites lifted their hands is they are afraid of you. We will never meet in council again. This concluded the council. WHITE PIGEON'S GRAVE [From the White Pigeon Republican, May ‘29, 1839.] [It is well known that this village and prairie, as also the beautiful stream that ﬂows along its southern border, take their name from an Indian chief whose grave may still be seen on a small eminence about one mile west of the village. The Indians were accustomed to regard this spot with much veneratiou. And it is said that in the ﬁrst settlement of the prairie, on account of its elevated situation, it was chosen by one of the hardy and

And every year as the early spring Crown'd the grove with its foliage wreath, His people came, their wild ﬂowers to bring, _ And strew o'er the grave of their chieftain king, And chaunt the wild dirge of death. Yet time passed on——and but once again The warrior belt and plume, The worn with age, and the youthful came— For strangers stood where their chief was lain, And their dwelling was over his tomb. Then the Indian mutter'd a vengeful curse, And was 10st in the forest shade, But ﬂames on the midnight darkness burst, 'Twas a fun'ral pyre to the chleftain's dust Which that white man’s cabin made. As fades the frost from the morning sun, Or the ﬂower in its chill embrace; S0 brief a race bath the Indian run, So swift are the forest hunters gone From before the pale-faced race. But though forced from their homes have the red men been, Or sunk to their forest grave, Yet ﬁx'd they have left upon wood and plain, On the silvery lake, and the winding stream, The titles their fathers gave. And chieftain, tho‘ years may thy glory hide, Nor thy warriors shall speak it again; . Yet while men shall inhabit the plain of thy pride, Or thy beautiful river still ﬂows at its side, Shall thy name, White Pigeon, remain. ALFRED. WHITE PIGEON, May 18, 1839.

E. H. THOMSON~EARLY LIFE 175 ED\VARD HUG HES THOMSON [From the “’olverine Citizen, ‘Flint, Feb. 6, 1886.] It is diﬁicult to realize and very sad to contemplate the fact that the stal~ wart form of Colonel Edward H. Thomson will never again be seen upon the streets of Flint; that his ever cordial greeting will never again be heard; that the inexhaustible fountain of his wit and anecdote will sparkle here no more; that the social circles where he was always the life and light, will never again be charmed by his conversation; that the listening crowd will no more be inspired from the rostrum by his dramatic lore; that the youthful aspirant for histrionic hays has lost forever the accustomed beneﬁt of his kindly encouragementhcriticism, aid, and instruction. It is sad, but alas too true, that the warm heart, the generous hand, the liberal soul, the cul- tured brain, the accomplished tongue, are cold and silent; and all\ that re- mains of Col. Edward H. Thomson has been laid to rest in Glenwood cemetery—baptized by him “God’s Acre.” . A newspaper is not the place for a biography, and none will be attempted here. Colonel Thomson‘s life has been active, distinguished, adventurous, and inﬂuential. It would alford material for an interesting volume, and it is to be hoped that some one competent to the task will assume the. under- taking of writing his hiography in an ample form. Meanwhile, the Citizen must conﬁne this death announcement to a mere allusion to the more salient points in the checkered life of the deceased. Edward H. Thomson was born at Kendal, in Westmoreland county, Eng- land, on June 15, 1810. He died from the effects of paralysis, at his resi- dence in this city, very early on the morning of Tuesday, February 2, 1886. When young Thomson was aboat three years old his family came to America and settled in the city of Boston, where he spent a few years. They afterwards removed to Westchester county, N. Y., where Edward H. entered and graduated from White Plains Academy. He studied law in the oﬂice of Millard Fillmore. afterwards president of the United States. After being admitted to the bar he practiced law in Buffalo. and in Cleveland, Ohio. He enlarged his mind by several years‘travel—two years being spent at sea, as a sailor before the mast. Soon after Michigan was admitted to the union, he adopted this state as his home and settled ﬁrst in Atlas. then a part of

176. E. H. THOMSON—OFFICIAL POSITION Lapeer county, and wa appointed prosecuting attorney of that county by Stevens T. Mason, Michigan’s ﬁrst governor. In 1838 he settled permanently in Flint, and became a partner in the law ﬁrm of Bartow 8: Thomson. John Bartow was then and until his death regarded as one of the ablest jurists of his day; and to be associated with him was in itself a letter of recommenda- tion. In 1844-5 Mr. Thomson accompanied Dr. Douglas Houghton in his explora- tions of the Lake Superior mining regions, and in 1847 he was elected to the state senate, Hon. William M. Fenton being elected lieutenant governor at the same time. 'Thomon at once took a leading position in the legislature, and wa the author of some important and successful measures, among them being the establishment of the institution at Flint, and the insane asylum at Kalamazoo. He was subsequently appointed by Governor Ransom, commissioner of emigration, in which capacity he served for three years, part of the time in New York, and part at Stuttgart, in Germany; and he was largely instru- mental in directing a stream of valuable immigrants to this state. In 1851, at the ﬁrst World’s Fair in London, he represented Michigan, as one of the commissioners of the United States, and, as usual, became distinguished for his social and business qualities. In 1858 he was again elected to the legis- lature; this time as member of the house of representatives. Upon the breaking out of the civil war, he took a prominent and active position among the loyal union democrats, and was appointed by Governor Blair, a member of the state military board, with the rank of colonel. He afterwards became president of the board. His connection with “Camp Thomson,” and the raising of the Tenth Michigan infantry volunteers in Flint, is'too well known to need dwelling upon here. ' He was for several years a member of the board of trustees of Union school district and in 1877 was elected mayor of this city. As predicated by his char- acter and capabilities, in every ofﬁcial position he ﬁlled, Colonel Thomson was found occupying a front rank. Notwithstanding his busy life as a man of aﬁairs, he never remitted the culture of his inborn taste for literature, the ﬁne arts and the drama. He was a connoisseur in all, and has left behind him visible and durable memorials of his cultivated taste. They will be found in some features of St. Paul’s church, in the best aspects of the city hall and in the interior ornamentation of the high school building. Glenwood ceme- tery, made roughly beautiful by nature, has been converted by art and taste into one of the loveliest “cities of the silent” to be found in this country. There also can Colonel Thomson’s ideas be traced on every hand. He took much pride in it, and his artist’s eye was never at fault. Only a few

PROCLAMATION 177 weeks since, during a ride through thecemetery with the colonel, he pointed out to the writer a number of additional improvements which he had in contemplation and intended to urge upon the directors as soon as the season was suitable. Little either of us then thought that his last work in that direction had been already accomplished. It is upererogatory to speak of Col. Thomson’s Shakespearean scholarship, or of his rare and splendid Shakespearean library—the collection of a long life time—now fortunately, one of the treasures of the state university. His Shakesperian lectures and readings had a. state reputation. Yesterday afternoon, after short religious services at the house, the casket was brought to St. Paul’s church, escorted by Gardner’s band and the Union Blues in uniform, and followed by the members of the bar of Genesee county in a body, and by the common council of the city. The bearers were the vestrymen of St. Paul’s church. The regular services were conducted by Rev. A. W. Seabrease, the rector. A large congregation was present and a long funeral procession followed the remains to the cemetery. A meeting of the bar was held on Tuesday afternoon, at the oﬁflce of Messrs. Durand & Carton, when G. H. Durand, J. H. Hicok, C. D. Long, 0. H. Wisner, and E. L. Bangs were appointed a committee to draft resolutions in relation to the death of Colonel Thomson, to be presented at the opening of the next term of the circuit court. ' On the same day a special meeting of the common council was held, when resolutions were adopted which will be found embodied in the following proc- lamation by the mayor: MAYOR’S PROCLAMATION It is my painful duty to announce to the citizens of Flint the death of the Hon. Edward H. Thomson, which took place at his late residence in this city, at twenty minutes to one o’clock on Tuesday morning, February 2, 1886. At a meeting of the common council on Tuesday morning the following resolutions were adopted: Resolved, That the common council have heard with deep regret of the death of the Hon Edward H. Thomson, of this city. Resolved, That as a body we desire to express the sorrow that we as a council and as citizens, feel in the death of a former mayor of our city, and one who has for so many years done so much for the social and material advancement of the city. Resolved, That as a token of respect for the deceased, the city building be draped in mourning, and that the mayor and common council attend the funeral in a body. Resolved, That the mayor be requested to issue a proclamation embodying these resolutions, and requesting the citizens generally to close their places of business during the hours of the funeral of the deceased. 23

Mathew Davison, mayor of the city of Flint, would- re- quest the ,citizens, so far as possible, to close their places of business on Friday, the ﬁfth day of February, 1886. at 2 o’clock P. M., and laying aside all ordinary business, attend the funeral of our distinguished citizen, as a mark of respect, and in ome sense to show the esteem in which he was held by us. D. D. ArrKnN, Clerk MATHEW DAVISON, Mayor Dated Flint. Feb. 3. 1886 At a special meeting of the 'Glenwood Cemetery Association the following resolutions were unanimously adopted: WHEREAS, Hon. E. H. Thomson, who for many years has been actively identiﬁed with, and for several years has been the president of this association. has been removed from earth, and WHEREAS, We, the surviving ofﬁcers and members of this association, unite in a common sorrow at his demise. therefore Resolved, That as an association, and as individual members thereof, we, thus publicly, give expression to our regret. Resolved, That in the death of Col. Thomson we recognize the loss of a public spirited. honorable man, a painstaking, conscientious ofﬁcial, and a patriotic citizen. Resolved, That. a copy of these resolutions be presented to Mrs. Thomson and to the news- papers of the city for publication. COL. EDWARD HUGHES THOMSON CONTRIBUTED BY E. S. “'ILLIAMS On the morning of February 2, 1886, the spirit of Edward H. Thomson left its earthly tenement of clay, and the struggle between the angel of death and a wonderfully powerful constitution had ended. On New Year’s day he was out on the street, a little feeble it is true, but be greeted everyone with a smile and one of those pleasant jests for which he was famous. 0n the Sunday following be was taken seriously ill, his lower limbs became partially paralyzed, and his physicians became alarmed. He rallied somewhat, but it was found that his whole system was badly shattered and must gradually decay. The paralysis ﬁnally affected his brain, and his condition was then recognized as almost hopeless. He was unconscious for several days, but again his constitution asserted itself, and he became quite rational. When conscious he greeted every visitor at his bedside with a pleasant remark and o

E. H. THOMSON‘EARLY CAREER 179 seemed to be almost himself again. But this was of short duration. paralysis again seized upon him, and it was known the end was near. Yesterday it was realized that that was the last day of his life, and family and friends anxiously watched each ﬂeeting breath. At 12:40 A. M.. with a little sigh, the soul ﬂitted from the body. and family and friends were in the presence 'of the dead. Q i l- The parents of Edward Hughes Thomson lived for some time in the pic- turesque town of Kendal, Westmoreland, England. a beautiful little city of about 12,000 inhabitants. lying on the west bank of a pleasant stream which, but a few miles below. emptied its limpid contents into Morechambe bay, where rose and fell the tides of the ever changing and treacherous Irish sea. In this lovely spot. but a few miles from the Scottish borders and almost within sight of the Isle of Man, the man whom now we mourn was born on the 15th day of June, 1810. In the summer of 1813 his parents moved tol this country, and settled in the city of Boston, Mass. where the father was in busi- ness for several years. In classic Boston the youth of young Thomson was spent, and there he received his early schooling. Afterwards he entered the White Plain academy in Westchester county. N. Y., and during a four years’ course in that institution achieved a reputation of being a hard student and a lover of the muse and stage. After graduating from this academy he spent several years in wandering and sightseeing, doing very little work in that time, but acquiring much valuable information, and storing it away in his wonderful memory. Two of these years he spent on the ocean as a sailor before the mast; and these two years proved of great beneﬁt to him, as he visited many lands which otherwise he would not have seen. Finally he settled down in Buffalo, N. ,Y., and began the study of law in the ofﬁce of Sherwood 8: Fillmore, the ﬁrm being composed of Thomas T. Sherwood and Millard Fillmore, afterward President of the United States. In 1832 he was admitted to the Erie county bar, and practiced in Buffalo with some success, afterwards moving to Cleveland, 0., where he continued in the law business. He went back to Buffalo and embarked in journalism for a time and gained the reputation of being a remarkably versatile and able writer. He assisted in the organization of the Buffalo Transcript_and was on its staff for some time. The friendship between young Thomson and Millard Fillmore con- tinued, and, up‘ to his death, the President took a. great deal of interest in him, and aided him in every way in his power. At the time when Michigan was admitted to the Union and emigration from New York to this state was at its height, young Thomson decided to cast his lot in the Peninsular state, and accordingly in 1837 we ﬁnd him

180 OFFICIAL POSITIONS located in the township of Atlas, which then formed a part of the newly organ; ized county of Lapeer. In 1847 he was elected to the state senate for the district embracing the counties of Genesee, Oakland, Lapeer, Shiawassee, Saginaw, Tuscola, and all of the counties north, including the upper peninsula. During the term of 1848 and 1849 he was chairman of the judiciary committee, of the committee on mines and minerals, and a member of the committee on state affairs. While he was in the senate he introduced the hills which resulted in the establishment of the institution of the deaf, dumb, and blind in this city; of the asylum for the insane at Kalamazoo; and also for the incorporation of the ﬁrst copper and iron mining companies in the upper peninsula. He had accompanied Dr. Douglas Houghton in his exploration of the Lake Superior region in 1844-45, and had in this way become acquainted_with its wonderful mineral resources. Another important bill introduced by him was one for the promotion of foreign emigration direct into Michigan. His great interest in this meaure was recognized by Governor Ransom, who appointed him as commissioner of emigration under the new law; an oﬁce which be ﬁlled for three years, ﬁrst having his office in New York \city, and afterwards establishing it in Stutt- gart, in the kingdom of Wurtemberg, Germany. Here in a personal inter- view with the king he laid before him the details of his emigration plan, and afterward gave a full explanation of the vast resources of Michigan by the publication and distribution of a pamphlet of some sixty pages, giving in de- tail an account of Michigan’s advantages as a place for new comers. This same information was also given to the public through the medium of the German press, and with such success that, during the ﬁrst year, 2,800 persons emigrated from that country to Michigan. The total result of his energetic etforts was an accession of nearly twenty ﬁve thousand to the population of the state; and these were principally of a hardy and enterprising class of mechanics and farmers, many of them possessing considerable pecuniary means. In 1851, while in London, he was appointed United States deputy commis- sioner of the ﬁrst world’s exhibition. In this position his assiduous atten- tions to American visitors, and his timely advice to American exhibitors' gained for him great praise, while his brilliant social qualities made him an honoredand welcome visitor in the homes of the nobility and gentry of the foremost city of the world. Upon returning to the United States he remained in Washington for several years. connected with the United States Senate, and afterward a prominent member of the “third house.” His friendships in Washington numbered among them the greatest lights of the

SHAKESPEAREAN LIBRARY—INFLUENCE 181 age, and his wonderful social talents and brilliant literary attainments made him very popular in the leading circles of the Capital. In 1856 he returned to Flint and resumed his law practice. In 1858 and 1859 he represented this district in the state legislature. At the breaking out of the war, although he had always been politically opposed to Gov. Blair, the latter, recognizing his executive ability, appointed him a member of the state military board with the rank of colonel, and upon the resignation of Gen. A. S. Williams, he became president of the board. He was untiring in his efforts to raise, organize and equip troops, and his efforts were recognized as being invaluable at the time. The 10th infantry was organized at Flint and received the particular attention of Col. Thomson, who had complete charge of their camps here, which was named Camp Thomson, in his honor. Since the war he has lived very quietly in our midst, contented to live with the laurels he had already earned. He has, however, served one term of three years as a member of the school board, and in April, 1877, was elected mayor of the city by a majority of 427, one of the largest majorities ever given to any ofﬁcer of the city. He ﬁlled the ofﬁce with great honor to himself and credit to the city,v and at the expiration of his term retired per- manently from politics. . Always a man of great literary tastes, during the years following the war he devoted his time very extensively to the study of English literature, and especially of Shakespeare and Shakespeareana. and was recognized the world over as an authority upon the thoughts and acts of the immortal hard of Avon. His Shakespearean library was one of the best of the kind in the world, and when he parted with it about three years ago, he did so with genuine sorrow.

Thomson was a leader in everything he undertook, and at one period of his life studied for the stage. The result was that although he did not adopt the stage as a profession, he became a reader and elocutionist of rare abilityj his keen literary perception enabling him to correctly interpret the exact meaning of an author at a. glance. During the seventies his Shake- spearean lectures and readings were greatly in demand throughout the state and were invariably spoken of in the highest terms. Col. Thomson was one of the best dramatic critics. He was wonderfully quick to recognize merit and he encouraged it in every way in his power. Many a person of literary ability, ﬁne conversational powers, or intelligence in reading, owes such ability, power and intelligence to the seed sown by

182 FRIEND AND CITIZEN Mr. Thomson, who delighted to be surrounded by those whom be pleased to call his protegés, and these during the latter twenty years of his life may be numbered by the score. (‘01. Thomson commanded a leading position wherever he was by his great mental endowment, and his inﬂuence was always exerted for good. Hewas always among friends, for to meet him was but to be his friend. Courtly, genial, the soul of honor, he was recognized as a prince among men. Col. Thomson was a member of several secret societies and had attained to high honors among the Knights Templar, Odd Fellows, Masons and other organizations. Col. Thomson leaves behind him a large number of relatives in the United States and England. He was twice married, the ﬁrst time, in Buffalo, when about 20 years of age. In 1841, he was married in this city to Miss Sarah T. Bush. daughter of David Bush of this city. His beloved wife still sur- vives him with whom she journeyed for ﬁve and forty years. One son only is living. Edward H. Thomson. Jr. A daughter by his ﬁrst wife is living, now Mrs. A. B. Wctherbee of Washington. A half brother of Col. Thomson, Charles Hughes, is a prominent attorney residing at Sandy Hill. N. Y. As a citizen, Flint was always proud of Col. Thomson, as well might be. He had done much for it, and was public spirited beyond his means. His books. his travels, his wonderful brain, had given him a polish and courtesy to all. that put every one at their ease, and ﬁlled each one who greeted him with wonder at his great tact and conversational powers. As a friend, he was the soul of honor, quick to forgive, slow to take offense and a gentleman in the highest sense in which the word can be used. And so as citizen. man, friend, we follow him to his last resting place, tears must come. and as he is placed forever from our sight, we turn frmn the new made grave with hearts ﬁlled with emotions that our tongues are powerless to express and realize. ’ “‘He was a man which, take him all in all, ‘ We shall not look upon his like again.” Edward H. Thomson will rest peacefully in Glenwood cemetery; the birds will sing their sweetest songs above his tomb, for he loved them; the ﬂowers will don their brightest tints and shed their sweetest perfumes over his grave, for he loved them; and we will keep his memory green in our hearts, for he loved his fellow men. Blessed must be the man who loves hi God. his fellow man, nature and hooks. His must be a soul indeed. Peace to his ashes.

BENJAMIN M. KING 183 ANOTHER PIONEER GONE—BENJAMIN M. KING BY JAMES w. KING Benjamin M. King, one of the early pioneers of St. Joseph county, died at the old home, two miles southwest of Three Rivers. on Wednesday morning, Sept. 15, 1886. aged 79 years. He was born near Middletown, N. Y., and was christened after his grandfather, Benjamin Montonye, a Baptist minister, and soldier of the revolutionary war, the man whom General Washingttm chose to carry the false dispatch into the British lines, which gave to the enemy the idea that an attack on New York was contemplated by the com- bined American and French forces, and which ﬁnally resulted in the capture of Cornwallis and his army at Yorktown. Mr; King remained in Orange county until manhood, and then went to Wayne county, where he lived for several years. Here he learned the shoe- maker‘s trade, and when relieved from his apprenticeship married Martha “’etherbee. Soon after this event the young couple tarted for the then con- sidered “out of the world” territory of Michigan. They reached White Pigeon in the month of May, 1832. and concluded to make their home in the prospective village of. Eschol, the landmarks of which can be found two miles south of Three Rivers, on the east bank of the St. Joseph, where the new bridge crosses that stream. In the same year he and Samuel Fitch were drafted as soldiers in the Black Hawk war. They served their‘country just one month at White Pigeon, when the capture of Black Hawk was announced, and the command to which they belonged disbanded. In 1833, the subject of this sketch removed to Constantine, and. together with Daniel Arnold, of Hull and Arnold’s famous band, rented a room and worked at shoemaking for some time. In 1834 he removed to Three Rivers, and lived in the Jacob McIntalfer house, the ﬁrst habitation erected by a white man in this now prosperous city. About 1835 he built one of the ﬁrst frame houses in Three Rivers. It occupied the site of the old Frye homestead. In 1836 he pur- chased 120 acres of land, two miles southwest of this city, built him a house. thereon, and commenced in earnest the work of preparing a permanent home

184 BENJAMIN M. KING for himself and family. For many years he worked at clearing his farm in the day time, and at his trade evenings. In 1846 the mother of his family died, leaving him with ﬁve children, the eldest of whom was sixteen, the youngest two years of age. Two years later he married Miss Elza Van Buren, who died just six months ago. She was the daughter of Ephraim Van Buren, one of the earliest pioneers to Battle Creek. Mr. King, for many years, took a deep interest in public affairs. He was an active participant in the anti- slavery struggle, and during-the war of the rebellion the Union had no ﬁrmer friend than he. He fought the battle of life like a true soldier, and well performed his part as a husband, father, and citizen. He leaves to mourn his loss four children, namely, John, of Waukegan, 111.; James W., of Fabius township; Mrs. C. H. Howe, of Raymond, Dakota; and Mrs. M. R. Dickin- son, of Rockford, Ill. Henry, the eldest son, died at his home, ﬁve miles northwest of this city, fourteen years ago. The funeral services, conducted by Rev. George Frost, took place at the residence of the son, James W.,- and the remains were interred in Riverside cemetery.

BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCHES REV. E. H. HAMLIN—AN EVENTFUL CAREER OF A MOST EXCELLENT AND USEFUL MAN BY A. D. P. VAN BUREN Elisha H. Hamlin was born August 1. 1808,, in Berkshire county, Massa- chusetts. His father’s family removed when he was a child to East Bloom- ﬁeld, Ontario county, N. Y., where he received the common school education of that day. He was clerk in his brother’s store in Murray, Onta- rio county, N. Y., from the time he was ﬁfteen years of age till he was twenty seven. _ He was married to Miss Maria Steadman, at Holly, New York. in 1829. His wife died some few years later. Soon after her death he entered Madison seminary, that Baptist seat of learning that became famous from the emi- nence its graduates afterwards achieved in the ﬁeld of foreign missions. He remained in this seminary under the instruction of President Kendricks one year. ,I 7 His ministerial record is as follows: He was ordained at Holly, N. Y., June 18, 1836. Soon after he came as a pioneer minister to Manchester,- Michigan. Preached at Rome, Ohio, one year; at Jackson, Michigan, three years; to the ﬁrst Baptist church in Chicago. from 1843 to 1846; at Laporte, Indiana, three years. Was agent for the American Bible Society two years, with his home at Jackson, Mich. He preached three years at Piqua, Ohio; and in 1855 went to Clinton, Louisiana, where he preached thirteen years, returning to the north in 1868. He preached ﬁve years at Ceresco, Michi- gan. He came to Galesburg in 1873, where he lived till he died December 20, 1885. One of the memorable events of his life was on the occasion of the ﬁftieth 24
Page 186
186 CHARACTER—SERMONS anniversary of the ﬁrst Baptist church in Chicago, in October, 1883. Mr. Hamlin was fourth pastor of this church, and the oldest living pastor. The early record was: Rev. A. B. Freeman .................................... 1833 to 1835 Rev. I. T. Hinton ...................................... 1835 to 1841 Rev. C. B. Smith ................ . ........................ 1842 to 1843 Rev. E. H. Hamlin ..................................... 1843 to 1845 Mr. Hamlin’s reminiscences given on that memorable occasion, and pub- lished in the Chicago papers. were very interesting. The above ﬁgures indi- cate that he was pastor of this church but two years. This was a mistake. He was there three years, as his own record proves it. He leaves a wife and three children; seven of his children having died. The three surviving are Mrs. C. A. Dye, Miss Ella Hamlin, of Chicago, and Mrs. Robert S. Percy, of Clinton. Louisiana. Mrs. Hamlin will now make her home with her daughter, Mrs. William A. Foote, of Clinton, Missouri. She has a son. Charles D. wood, living in Denver, Colorado. Rev. L. B. Fish. of Paw Paw, says of Mr. Hamlin: “The ﬁrst time I ever saw dear brother Hamlin was in the fall of 1836, when this state was a terri- tory. He preached the second sermon I heard after- coming west, in a log school house on the plain a few miles west of Manchester. Hillsdale county. From that time till now I have respected him, loved him, and honored him. He was always a gentleman of great reﬁnement and purity; a most devout and consistent christian. He was more than an average preacher, and one of the best pioneer pastors. The impression he made on me when I wa a boy as I used to see him, with my pastor, Rev. J. J. Fulton, and Dr. Piper, in protracted meetings, visiting. preaching, praying. singing, exhorting, and encouraging sinners to change their lives. lingers sweetly in my memory yet. He has gone to join a host of christian pioneers of this state. many of whom he has outlived, but has ‘come down as a shock of corn fully ripe.’ ” Mr. Hamlin’s sterling christian character has been a living sermon for the good of every church to which he has preached. and for every community in which he has resided. A character that ever gave additional effectiveness to his pulpit discourse and to his miniterial labors'. Better than all sermons or printed creed. Is christian living in word and deed; Better than all precepts both old and new, Is christian example from pulpit and pew. His sermons were always able. clear, concise and instructive. His discourse was animated with the fervor and boldness of one who feels himself “thrice

DEACON ISAAC MASON 187 armed” in a righteous cause. Whether it were in church, Sabbath school. educational, temperance or mission work, in every good cause, his life has been devoted from ﬁrst to last, to the service of his Master. We have never known a minister who had so many sincere friends among the clergy of other denominations, or among the members of different churches wherever he has resided. This has been especially true of his life in Galesburg. Although he had retired from the pulpit when he came here. yet the Baptist church of this place has had in him its best counsellor and most zealous supporter. When in need of preaching, he has ever been ready to supply its pulpit, and help it in. all its work. And when a pastor of any of our churches has been absent, he has kindly consented to preach to his ﬂock; and on funeral occasions he has been a kind and sympathetic pastor to admin- ister spiritual aid and consolation to the grief stricken and sort-owing. In so many ways has this good man endeared himself to this entire community. that all feel that they have lost a most valuable and dear friend. Says a brother clergyman, “no minister was ever more respected or honored by the Baptist church of this state. than Rev. E. H. Hamlin. Amid all the labors and trials of his long and useful services in the Baptist church, no cloud ever. hung over his name, not the slightest imputation or stain ever attached to his character.” The funeral services were held in the Congregational church on Wednesday at 10:30 A. M., Rev. J. S. Boyden of Kalamazoo, assisted by Rev. Dr. Mather of Battle Creek, ofﬁciating. The remains were taken to Jacksonifor burial. DEACON ISAAC MASON—AN OLD PIONEER DEPARTED Deacon Isaac Mason was born in Cheshire, Berkshire county, Mass, Nov. 23, 1798; came to the Genesee valley, N. Y. in 1802; lived three years at Farmington, then removed to Pennﬁeld, Monroe county, where he lived many years. He afterwards lived in Orleans and Cattaraugus counties. He came to Michigan in 1827 on a land hunting tour, and spent a large part of the year prospecting in Washtenaw and adjoining counties, and without locating any lands, returned to his home in New York. Reminiscences of this visit to Michigan will be found in the ﬁfth volume of the Michigan Pioneer Collections. Deacon Mason removed with his family to this state in May, 1839, settled on the Dr. John Beach farm in South Battle Creek, where he remained a number of years. In February, 1843, he took charge of the Hiram Moore farm on Climax-prairie. living there

188 POSITION IN COMMUNITY—HIS SONS ﬁve years, and afterwards spent three years on his farm in Charleston. .While living on Climax, his home was a station on the underground rail- road to aid escaped slaves on their way to Canada. In 1858 he was appointed superintendent of the Kalamazoo county farm, which position he held until 1870, when he removed to Galesburg, where he lived till his death, which occurred on the 29th of December. 1885. Deacon Mason had been married four times. His last wife. Mrs. Charlotte Thiers, died some four years ago. He leaves ﬁve children: Henry, who lives in Cattaraugus, N. Y.; Lee A., at Comstock. this county; Russell B.. at Holton, Mich., and Mrs. Abel Hoag and Miss Mary Ann Mason, of Gales- burg. Deacon Mason'united with the Baptist church in Pennﬁeld, N. Y., in 1826. was made deacon in 1834. Was justice of the peace ﬁve years in Orleans county, N. Y. Was supervisor three years in the same county. Was super- visor one year in Charleston, this county. and one year in Comstock. In his recollections of life in western New York, that he has given me I recall this item: “My old school teacher was hoeing in his garden one Sat- urday when a carriage drove up to his gate containing the ‘Morgan abducﬂ ors;’ he dropped his hoe, went into the house, changed his coat. and getting into the carriage, rode 011’ with them.” Deacon Mason was one of the memorable “nine” who voted for Jabez S. Fitz for governor, on 'the “free soil ticket,” in Battle Creek, in 1841. He was originally a democrat. but early joined the abolitionists, and went with them into the republican party. The military record of his sons is excellent. His eldest, James B., was colonel of the 11th Michigan cavalry and was killed at the battle of Clinch Mountain, Va., on the 4th of October, 1864. Edwin D., after serving through the Mexican war, died on his return home at Jefferson barracks, just below St. Louis, July 7, 1848. Henry 0., now a minister of the M. E. church at Dayton, Cattaraugus county, N. Y., served in the 44th N. Y. infantry during the war for the Union. I Lee A. served in the Michigan 2nd infantry through the war for the Union. I . George P.. captain of Company A, Michigan 11th cavalry, was killed at Mar- ion, Va, December 18, 1864. Russell B., served through the war in the 7th Michigan infantry, and lives now at Holton, Mich. ' How many men have caught the ear of public fame whose lives have been unworthy of the honorable record that Deacon Isaac Mason leaves.

LANKFORD BURDICK 189 His life, lengthened beyond three score years and ten, has been full of use- fulness and good deeds to his fellow men. He has been a prominent and valu- able member of the Baptist church for. more than ﬁfty years. And now, at the 1 close of such an extended period of life, he has been gathered to his rest, like a .full shock of corn._ Few men have been so long and so well known in Cal~ houn and Kalamazoo counties as this worthy old pioneer. And, like many of those who have gone before him, he leaves the rich heritage of a good name to his family and friends, the best legacy to the history of those early days in Michigan in which he has taken so active a part. LANKFORD BURDICK ONE MORE OF THE OLD SETTLERS GONE Lankford Burdick was born in Pittsﬁeld, Massachussetts, on the 29th of May. 1797. When he was young his parents moved to New Lisbon, Otsego county, N. Y. His subsequent life in the state of New York was spent on the farm. On January 1, 1826, at Lewisville, Otsego county, he was united in marriage to Miss Caroline Toby, by the grandfather of the bride, Rev. Zacheus Toby. a Baptist clergyman there, ninety one years old. Robert Burdick, with his family. emigrated from Otsego county, N. Y., in 1833, and settled in Charleston, Kalamazoo county, Michigan. With him came his sons Lankford, Alvan and Charles with their young families. The father and sons each locating separate lands formed the nucleus of a colony in this new region, and that part of Charleston was long and widely known as the “Burdick settlement.” Lankford and his family stayed the ﬁrst week here in the hospitable cabin of the old pioneer. Asa Gunn. ' Mr. Burdick’s oldest daughter, now Mrs. H. W. Bush, of Chicago, informs the writer that in coming to Michigan they were one week in crossing Lake Erie, and when they-began their journey from Detroit, inland with their ox team, they were two days going ten miles. There being no bridges over the streams, they forded them all till they reached Marshall, where they found the ﬁrst bridge. She was then but four years old, and her graphic, child- like description of the new country, which was sent back to the friends east, was as follows: “There was a great deal of water and no bridges, a great farm with no fences, and one hundred and two mud holes.” When Lankford Burdick built his rude cabin in Charleston in 1833 the

Mr. Burdick converted his wild burr oak lands into a valuable farm, which he, in 1853, sold to A. R. Holcomb. and removed to Galesburg, where he lived till the time of his death. He leaves four children: Mrs. Harvey W. Bush, of Chicago; Mrs. George A. Signor, of Arthur, Dak.; Mrs. W. A. Blake, of Galesburg, and Mrs. C. H. McConnel. of Jackson. Mr. Burdick‘s life in Michigan embraces nearly the entire period" of this country’s history. He has well and faithfully performed his part in placing Kalamazoo county among the ﬁrst in the state in point of good farming, thrift, and enterprise. The traits that characterize the old days of half a century ago, presever- ance, industry, frugality, self reliance, and the knack that goes with it, were exempliﬁed in_ this thrifty old pioneer’s after life. Mr. Burdick was a republican in politics, a most worthy citizen, and a prominent and valuable member of the Baptist church of Galesburg. In fact this church, which is the oldest in that denomination in western Michi- gan, has great cause to cherish the memory of Lankford Burdick, for the wise counsel and ﬁnancial aid'he has given it in times of its greatest need. This church has been called, within the short space of sixteen days, to mourn the loss of its three most honored members—Rev. E. H. Hamlin, Deacon Isaac Mason, and La'nkford Burdick. ‘ The funeral services were held in the Baptist church, at 1 P. M., on Friday, the 8th inst, Rev. J. S. Boyden ofﬁciating. BENJAMIN TOBY Benjamin Toby was born on the 19th of November, 1796, in Massachusetts. He came from Otsego county, N. Y., to Charleston, Mich, in 1844, where he has lived till his death on the 9th inst. He leaves three children, Mrs. J. A. Ranny, of Augusta; Hiram and Geo. Toby, of Charleston. He was a member of the Baptist church of Galesburg. That church has within three weeks lost four of its oldest members. The funeral services were held at the late home of deceased in Charleston, Sunday, the 19th inst, at 1 P. M., Rev. J. S. Boyden oﬁ‘iciating. -

WELL KNOWN BATTLE CREEK RESIDENT 191 L. S. HOWELL DEATH OF A WELL KNOWN FORMER BATTLE CREEK RESIDENT L. S. Howell died of inﬂammation of the bowels at his late residence in Kalamazoo, October 28, 1885. He came with his father’s family to Battle Creek in 1835. His father, Capt. David W. Howell, located 320 acres of land southeast of Battle Creek, including the farm of the late Jeremiah Brown, to whomhe soldlthe portion known as the Brown farm. Capt. Howell taught school in Marshall in 1835 and ’36, and he also followed Warren B. Shepard as teacher in the log school house in'Battle Creek in 1837. After selling to Jeremiah Brown, Capt. Howell removed to New York state, where he died many years ago. He is well remembered by the oldest settlers in Battle Creek. ' L. S. Howell was young when he came to Battle Creek and spent his school day and until he attained his majority in that place. He learned the wagonmaker’s trade, working for Elijah Clapp a number of years, and afterwards going into business for himself. He married Miss Frank Lockhart, of Galesburg, to which place he removed a number of years ago. He afterwards visited the south, took a trip to California, lived several years in Lincoln. Nebraska, and ﬁnally returned to Galesburg some few years ago. During the ﬁrst of this month he removed to Kalamazoo, where he died, as stated. ' _ , Mr. Howell was a great lover of music, early mastering the accordion, out of which, it used to be said, he could get all the music it could produce. He next took the violin, with which he not only won his way to the best musical circles in this part of the state, but also in Rochester, N. Y., and other parts of the country he had visited. He was considered one of the best violinists in the state. For a few years past he had given his attention to piano tuning, in which business he had worked up a large practice in this part of the state. He leaves a wife to mourn his loss. Mr. Howell was a quiet, unassuming man, not quick to form new acquaintances, rather holding to his old friends, to whom he was ever true, and in whose society he preferred to spend his leisure hours. So well known and appreciated was he by the lovers of music in western Michigan, that for a number of years past he was continually receiving invitations to aid with his violin in some musical concert or other public gathering. Mr. Howell was of a social, reserved nature. The best part of life to him was in its quieter walks. far “from the maddening crowd.” His death

192 LEVI DUNNING—ISAAC 'CORY calls to mind recollections of the once favorite boarding place on Main street, Battle Creek, presided over by that landlady of the manor born, Mrs. Percy Smith. The set at table consisted of Marsh Giddings, Dwight May, M. H. Joy, Moses Sutton, Mr. Putman and wife, George Thomas and wife, and L. S. Howell, the writer, and a few others. Howell. with his accordion and violin, was ever a favorite with the inmates of “Aunt Percy’s” home. But he has gone to the other side. and it is only a matter of time as regards his old friends following him. LEVI DUNNING Levi Dunning, one of our old townsmen, died at his late residence in Gales- burg. of Bright’s disease, on Tuesday, August 18, 1885, in his 77th year. Mr. Dunning was married in Genesee county, N. Y., 1832, to Miss Harriet Mills, the daughter of Asa Mills. Mr. Mills was a pioneer to western New York, and came with his family to Ann Arbor in 1826, where his son Loren yet lives. This was a noted pioneer family. Simeon, Willard and Augustus settled at Gull prairie in 1831, some of the other sons settling in Galesburg at an early period. , \ Mr. Dunning lived some years at Verona, Calhoun county, from there in 1852 he went to California and in 1854 came to Galesburg, where he lived till his death, as stated above. On his coming to this place he united with the Methodist Episcopal church at Galesburg. He was an industrious, hard working man, and as the fruits of his labor, leaves his family a fair property. In politics‘he was a republican, but whatever views he had. he held toithem unswervingly. He was what we call a positive, angular man and he went through life unchanged, ready to give his opinions without stint or favor to friend or foe, a. man of strong convictions, sincere purposes, who lived his religion. He was withal a man of strict integrity, 9. good citizen, a strong supporter of every good measure or enterprise that would beneﬁt the com- munity in which he lived. His son Edward went to the war and died in Andersonville prison. He leaves a wife and ﬁve daughters. ISAAC CORY Isaac Cory died at Cedar Springs, on the 21st inst. of consumption.

Cooley, who died at the home of his niece in Bedford, several days ago, came to this place in 1836, and worked a year or more for the old pioneer inn keeper, Ralph Tuttle; he also worked a year or more for Mr. Dunham, the pioneer nurseryman of Portage. Mr. Cooley ﬁrst located in Ross where he purchased a farm. Of late years he has been well known here, at Augusta and Battle Creek. Though in poor health for a long time, yet naturally industrious and thrifty. he has proved the truth of the old adage, “better wear out than rust out ;” for he always found some kind of work that he could do, and thus kept adding to his stores, besides being of beneﬁt to the community where he lived. He never married. He' had a clear memory of the early days in the eastern part of this county. The Writer has obtained many important item in the early history of this region from this worthy old pioneer. He was a member of the Baptist church at Augusta and was a republican in politics. He had accumulated considerable property. His work is done, he has departed, leaving a good name among those who knew him. GILBERT HIGGINS Gilbert Higgins died at his home in Augusta on the 5th of September, 1885. Mr. Higgins came to Otsego in 1834. He was a millwright. He came to Augusta in 1835; built the ﬁrst mill and the ﬁrst frame house in that place. As a millwright he was a very useful man for this new country. He died in the house he erected'in his robust manhood leaving a good name among his fellow men for the usefulness of hislife and for his excellent character. He leaves a wife. a son and a daughter.

WILLIAMS, or FLINT Major Oliver Williams was born at Roxbury, Mass., May 6, 1774, and died on his farm at Silver lake, Oakland county, Michigan. October 11, 1834. In the spring of 1819, Major Williams moved to Silver lake, from Detroit-where he had resided since 1815, and with three men cut their own road through the woods and drove the ﬁrst horse team ever driven from Detroit toPontiac. He settled on the south bank of Silver lake, in the town of Waterford. which was then on the frontier of civilization. ' Major Williams had visited Detroit in 1808, and was at that place most of the time during the. war of 1812; being present there at Hull‘s surrender. MRS. MARY WILLIAMS (WIFE OF OLIVER WILLIAMS). A paper, speaking of the death of Mrs. Williams, says: “Died at Pontiac, April 1. 1860. She was born January 11, 1777, in Concord, Mass. The last year of Mrs. Williams’ life was one of intense suffering, which she bore with christian fortitude, in the full hope of a blessed immortality. Mrs. Williams leaves a large circle of relatives and friends to mourn her loss. For forty years she had been a resident of the county. From her position. Mrs. Williams became acquainted with many of the ﬁrst emigrants and settlers of the county. Her kindness and courtesy to the early settlers won their esteem and none made her acquaintance who did not become her friends. and the attachment formed in the early settlement of the county remained unbroken during her. life. For several years Mrs. Williams has resided withvher daugh- ter. Mrs. Schuyler Hodges, from whose residence the remains were yesterday removed and deposited in the Oak Hill cemetery beside her husband. Mrs. Williams was the mother of fourteen children, ten sons and four daughters, seven of whom only\survive their parents: E. S. Williams of Flint; A. L. and B. 0. Williams of Owosso; Mrs. Mary A. Hodges, of Pontiac, and Mrs. Har- riet L. Rogers, A. F. and James M. Williams, of California. Mrs. Mary William had forty two grandchildren and sixteen great grandchildren.” The Boston Telegram says: “An old landmark gone. The Lee house, Concord, Massachusetts. built in 1688. was burned to the ground a short time since.

Many years afterwards it passed into the hands of the old millionaire, Billy Gray, who sold it in 1820 to the late Joseph Bassett, Esq.” Mrs. Williams was born in this house and lived in it many years after her marriage, it being the property of her father, Samuel Lee. Many of her' children were born while she resided in this home. The house remained her mother’s after her father’s death, until her family left for Detroit in 1815. Mrs. Williams requested that $600 of her estate be appropriated for the erection of a family monument. Her children added to this amount sufﬁ- cient to erect a handsome plain marble family monument, which stands on one of the most beautiful spots in Oak Hill cemetery, in Pontiac, surrounded by most or many of the members of her family. The monument bears the masonic emblems of the Master Mason, Mr. Williams having been a member of the order. It also bears the family coat of arms, which is the Williams family coat of arms in Wales. .M-v HON. GARDNER D. WILLIAMS ‘ In the State Republican, Lansing, we ﬁnd the following obituary notice: Hon. Gardner D._Williams died at his residence in Saginaw City, on Sat- urday morning, Dec. 11, 1858, aged 56 years. Mr. Williams was born in Concord, Mass, Sept. 9, 1804.

Stevens, of Flint (both deceased), and Mary, widow of the late Schuyler Hodges, of Pontiac. and Harriet, wife of Geo. W. Rogers, of Pontiac (both deceased). Mr. Williams went early into the Indian trade with his brother, E. S., for many years as agent of the American Fur company, speaking Indian ﬂuently. His power over them was complete, owing to his dignity, his strength of will, and his taciturn, self-collected manner. In personal character, Gardner D. Williams was honorable, upright, liberal, and like the entire family, temper- ate. He was hospitable, as thousands now living can testify, who have sat at his table and have refreshed themselves after their long wood and river journeys to reach his home. As a husband and father he was kind and care- ful. a kindness and care which be extended to all relations and kindred who sought his aid. The deceased exercised a wide personal inﬂuence through the nature and extent of his business, and from the number looking to him.

- 196 CAROLINE L'.—-ALFRED'L. 'WILLIAMS The political inﬂuence of Mr. Williams was considerable, and was exercised with judgment. in such a manner as coincided with his views of right. He was -a useful'man in community. and held very many local ofﬁces, which he faithfully discharged, without beneﬁt to himself. but because they were needful. He also held many other public ofﬁces at different times' during his life. both under the federal government and the state government, in all of which, as well as those of a more local character above named, he acquitted himself with honor. He had at different times held the ofﬁce of Indian farmer and of Indian interpreter. for-the duties of which he was u'nusually well ﬁtted. and if we are not mistaken. ﬁlled one of these up to the day of his death. Mr. Williams was a commissioner of the ﬁrst board of internal improve- ‘ments, appointed March 21. 1837; was county judge of Saginaw county for several years. was elected senator from the Sixth district in November. 1844. and received the oﬂlce of circuit court commissioner of Saginaw cOunty during the same year. His brother. E. held the otl‘lcepf postmaster under President Jackson. for several years, and on leaving Saginaw in 1840,.he resigned the oﬂice, and recommended to the department the appointment of his brother, G. D., to take his place as postmaster, which he received and held for many years. ' Judge Williams leates in his own immediate family a devoted wife. who mourns his loss deeply and sincerely, three sons and the remaining relatives to whom we have before alluded. Mr. \Villiams was a life long democrat and his three sons. also his four brothers, were all democrats of the old Jacksonian school. Mrs. Eliza Beach Williams. widow of G. I).

VARIOUS ENTERPRISES 197 18. 1808, in Concord. Mass, and died January 6, 1886, at his residence in Owesso, Michigan. Mr. Williams and his brother, B. 0. Williams, purchased the land of the government. laid out the' city of 0wosso, settled there and commenced business under the ﬁrm name of A. L. 82 B. 0. Williams. In 1831, accompanied by his brother Benjamin 0., he threaded the forests between Pontiac and Shiawassee county and established a trading post on an eighty acre lot. previously entered by him. From 1832 to 1836 the two brothers were' acting as agents for the American Fur company. In 1837 the post was aban- doned. At his suggestion. land had been purchased from the government at what was termed “the Big Rapids.” A little later some improvements were made on it. Mr. Williams saw in that locality, with its ﬁne water power and good soil. well drained by the river. a possible future city, and with a strong determination to make it such, in 1837 he came to Owosso and began the city of Owosso. with whose. interests in heart and struggles from that day to his last days he was fully though quietly identiﬁed. With his brother, the contract was taken to “grub and clear” forty miles of land from the center of the county to Lyons, westward, for the Northern rail- ‘road. One half of this was completed by them. In 1846 Mr. Williams was appointed county treasurer, after the embarrassments caused by the misman- agement of his predecessor. In 1850 he went to California and did active and lasting service in the construction of a water race, from Nevada City to what is known as "Rough and Ready.” returning tof)wosso in 1851. In 1852 he again went to California, having ﬁtted out an expedition to go thence overland. In 1857 he was absorbed in the Amboy. Lansing S; Traverse Bay railroad. now the Saginaw division of the Michigan Central. Of this road Mr. Williams was president. By securing land grants he did an important work, without which the develdpment of the vicinity of Owosso could not have taken place. Considerable of his time during this enterprise was spent in New York, in the interests of the road. After the sale of the road, various enterprises. mainly mining in California and Honduras, South America, occupied his mind. In 1871 he went to London to enlist English capitalists in American mining interests. Four years were thus spent. The gigantic scheme of his life—it may be said—was that of building a railroad from Richmond. \Ta“ to Clifton Forge, and the development of vast coal ﬁelds and iron mines. The project was so far successful that the road was built. and the work in part developed. Financially the attempt was not a success. While not the chief object, it may be said that all other enterprises proved successful ﬁnancially. Such in brief are some of those dry transcripts of events which crowded this life. Those who knew him could not fail to be impressed with the idea that he

198 ‘ ALPHEUS F. W'ILLIAMS was set to be an executor of great designs, a leader, one made in constitution and capacity to direct men. In transactions with his brother, in whom he had, and with reason, the utmost conﬁdence, there was much which he treated as in a careless manner, because of the consciousness that its care would burden his mind while he aimed at entering broader ﬁelds. From early life Mr. Williams was through all of it. very closely associated with hi surviving brother in Owosso—a man who, in some essentials of his character, is the opposite of what Alfred was—who has so demeaned himself in all their business relations as to retain ever that conﬁdence which grows up between boys in a well ordered home. Besides that the success which had crowned all other undertakings, and that large element of conﬁdence in the worth of man, in his correct intentions, led him to have an undue conﬁdence in man- kind. Matters which others could execute and ought to execute, he conﬁded to them for execution, no doubt often to his own detriment. Some would say, “Well, any man ought to know better, and he especially.” True as meant, but what is meant by it? Simply this, that the intent of self care ought to be strong enough to keep man from an over conﬁdence in men which works one’s own harm.‘ ALPHEUS F. WILLIAMS Alpheus F. Williams, son of Oliver and Mary Williams, was born in Con- cord, Mass, Nov. 12, 1812; married Miss Ann Simpson at Saginaw City and was a resident of that city several years. He went to California at an early day; A California paper contained the following. Death of Col. Williams. The peaceful termination of an adventurous camera—Shortly after 4 o’clock yesterday afternoon Col. Alpheus Fuller Williams, of Oakland, breathed his last. Col. Williams was a remarkable man. He was essentially a pioneer. The thirst for adventure which dominated his character in youth clung to him to the last. He was born in Massachusetts in 1812 and reared in Michigan. His parents moved to the latter state, the then far west, when he was an infant in arms, and his boy- hood days were passed amid those stirring scenes of early frontier life that live in history and tradition. In 1849 Col. Williams caught the gold fever and left his Michigan home 'for Californian. He was then, at the age of thirty seven, a man” of large stature and herculean strength. a ﬁne shot, excellent horseman, and _ thoroughly versed in wood craft. '

EXPEDITION TO-ALASKA. - 199 The long and dangerous journey across the plains was one round of pleasure for him and he took kindly to the rough life of the early Cali- fornians. He was one of the ﬁrst men to build.mining ditches in this state, and was also an original owner in the Blue Gravel company. - He acquired a fortune in mining and returned to Michigan to lead a life of ease. He soon tired of the older civilization and taking his family moved back to California. He engaged in mining in Nevada, Sierra and other northern counties, but made his home in Oakland. He was one of the earliest resi- dents of the latter city and contributed materially to its development. Two years ago, at the age of seventy, Col. William formed a. party to prospect Alaska for the precious metals—not only formed. a party but assumed its leadership. A more striking illustration of the restlessness of the typical American pioneer could not be cited than this incident in the career of Col. Williams—a'man seventy years old leaving a pleasant and attractive home in the garden spot of California, to prospect the sterile and rugged- mountains of the frozen north; not as a matter of necessity, but from choice. His surroundings were so delightful that any man might have envied him. A’loving and devoted wife and atfectionate children and grandchildren were ever ready to anticipate his desires. And yet he wanted to get into a new country and rough it. So he went to Alaska with his party in a small schooner, was wrecked, suffered greatly from exposure, and never fairly- recovered from the effects of the journey. Last year he wanted to visit Alaska again, but was deterred by ill health. His company sent up a schooner. however, and as yet nothing has been heard of her. Six months ago Col. Williams was taken ill and began to fail. His death yesterday was due to a complication of diseases, the heart and lungs being mostly affected. He leaves a wife, two sons and two daughters, all of whom are well known in San Francisco and Oakland. The sons are Gardner F. and Robert N. “’illiams, and the daughters are Mrs. E. B. Clement and Mrs. T. C. Van Ness. Col. Williams was a man of rugged integrity and leaves behind him a stainless name. Col. Williams was a Mason—a thirty second degree member of the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite of Free Masonry. for the state of California. HARRIET LOCADA WILLIAMS Harriet Locad'a Williams, daughter of Oliver and Mary Williams. was born Feb. 10, 1814, in Concord, Mass. and died in San Francisco. on Sunday, August 31. 1884. Harriet married Geo. W. Rogers. who died April 9. 1859.

200 Mas. MARY A. WALKER at his residence, Pontiac, after a long and painful illness, which he bore with christian fortitude and resignation. "Mr. Rogers was born in New Haven, Vermontf He resided for some years at Vergennes, Vt. He took up his ' residence in Detroit, in 1840, and in the subsequent year removed to Pontiac, where he afterward resided. During his residence among us he has been identiﬁed with the best interests of the village, and has ever maintained a true and spotless character in all the relations of life. He was a faithful friend and brother, a kind and affectionate husband and father, and a good man whom a large circle of friends and acquaintances will mourn with sincere sorrow. “Thus has been broken a. link connecting the present with the age of the revolution; Mr. Rogers having been born on the very same day and hour which witnessed the last early breath of George Washington. Thus in the mellow evening of a well spent life a good man meets the common fate of all. When such men pass away we all may truly mourn. “Mr. Rogers was a member of the Masonic fraternity, and was one of the founders of the lodge in Pontiac. He leaves a wife. two sous and two daugh- ters to mourn his loss. One of his sons, Mr. Forde Rogers. resides in Detroit. His two daughters are married and reside in California.” ' The above remarks are taken from a Pontiac paper at the time of his death. The four children above were by his ﬁrst wife, who was an Emmons, sister of the late Halmer H. Emmons, Esq., of Detroit. \ . MRS. MARY A. WALKER Mrs. Mary A. Walker, wife of Hiram Walker, Esq., and eldest daughter of E. S. Williams, was born Sept. 25, 1826, and died Sept. 14, 1872. “None knew her but to love her, none named her but to praise.” Her aunt. Mrs. R. W. Jenney, of Flint, was not able to attend the funeral of Mrs. Walker. but her daughter, Miss Belle Jenney, attended the funeral of her cousin. Upon Miss Belle’s leaving for her home the friends made up a beautiful hon» quet for her mother, Mrs. Jenney, ‘and upon receiving the bouquet Mrs. Jen-' ney composed the following lines: IN MEMORJAM—MRS.

Being the daughter of one of the founders of 0w0ss0, and at the time of her- death, with one exception, the oldest born resident of the place. she may truly be said to have grown up with it. Actively cooperating in all enter- prises for its moral and intellectual advancement, she has been from her childhood conspicuously identiﬁed with the social development of Owosso: while her excellent qualities of character and amiable disposition have always won the love and esteem of the community with which her life has been so intimately associated. . ‘ At the age, of eighteen years she was conﬁrmed by Bishop Doane, while a member of his school at'St. Mary’s hall, Burlington, N. J., and from that time she has ever been a zealous worker in the Episcopal church, and an humble. consistent christian. She was one of the earliest members of Christ church in Owosso, being the second communicant in the parish, and her labors have been unceasing in its welfare. From the organization of the Sunday school she occupied a position of teacher and labored indefatigably. On the 30th of December she was married to Mr. William M.

JAMES N. GOTEE—JEROME N. GOTEE 203 Mr. Williams was one of the most talented and honored members of the junior class of the university. \He died at Ann Arbor, on the 25th, after a very brief illness, which was not considered dangerous till the day before his death; The funeral was attended by a large concourse of sympathising friends. and the remains were followed to the grave by a deputation from his class. and by a number of the members of the Alpha Delta Phi fraternity, to which he belonged while in college, and who acted as pall bearers on the occasion. He was a young man of ﬁne promise, and beloved and esteemed by the pro- fessors as well as by his fellow students, for the uprightness of his character and genial disposition. Endeared to the hearts of those who knew him his loss will not soon be forgotten. J AMES N. GOTEE James N. Gotee, brother of Mrs. E. S. Williams, died at his residence in Saginaw City, on the morning of December 8, 1867, aged 53 years. Mr. Gotee was born in Cayuga county, New York, August 29, 1814. More than - thirty years since he came to this state, making Pontiac his temporary rest- ing place. Thence he rem0ved to Saginaw in 1836. so that for thirty one years he has been a resident among us. The estimation in which he was held by his fellow citizens is evinced by the fact that he was elected to the oﬂ‘ice of justice of the peace and afterwards to that of county register, an office which he held for two terms. He was also placed in the responsible position of postmaster for eight years. in Saginaw City. He retired from the discharge of his ofﬁcial duties without the imputation of a stain upon his character. From earliest years he was a religious man, performing every duty, social, domestic and religious, with the utmost ﬁdelity. His end was peace. At 5 o’clock Sunday morning he gently fell asleep. At that self same hour, of the self same week day, on which the Lord of Glory burst the bonds of death, the emancipated spirit of James N. Gotee, we humbly trust and believe, was with the Lord. “Let me die the death of the righteous, and let my last end be like his.”—From the funeral sermon of Rev. I. Leach. ' JEROME N.

ELIAS GOTEE WILLIAMS (SON OF E. S. AND U. M. WILLIAMS). Last week we brieﬂy announced the death of Mr. Elias G. Williams, son of our respected fellow townsman, E. S. Williams, Esq. To-day we 'give a more extended notice, for Mr. Williams’ death was so sudden and, we may say, unexpected, that many of his friends and relations failed to hear of it until the last sad tribute had been paid to their departed friend, and can only express themselves in words of deep regret and sorrow at the loss of one that all who had the pleasure of being acquainted with knew but to love him and respect him. Mr. Williams was born vin Saginaw City, April 11. 1838. and died April 23. 1884, being in the forty seventh year of his age. He fully realized how serious his illness was, and requested to be buried beside his little son in Glenwood cemetery, in Flint, and his remains were. there- fore, brought to his father’s residence here, from which the funeral took place on Saturday. the 26th of April. Mr. Williams, at the opening of the late civil war, enlisted in Colonel Fenton’s Eighth Michigan infantry, and was appointed commissary sergeant, being afterwards promoted to the rank of quartermaster, and holding that position during his service with the regiment, which was” about two years. Previous to joining the “Eighth” he was clerk and assistant postmaster under his father, in this city, for seven years and was greatly esteemed for his courtesy and obliging manners t0 the public. He left Flint for Windsor, Ont, about ﬁveyears ago. where he was in business until a short time previous to his death—Flint 0in paper, April, 1881,. MRS.

mas. a. s. WILLIAMS 205 Mrs. Williams returned on Saturday previous to her illness from South- ﬁeld, Oakland county, where she was called about three weeks ago to attend - the funeral of a brother. On Monday she performed some duties around her house incident to having been absent from home, which probably involved exposure to a delicate constitution, and at evening experienced a chill, fol- lowed by another the next morning, when Dr. McCormick was called in. He found slight congestion of the lungs, administered remedies, and Wednes- day morning she appeared better; but at night drowsiness set in, which deep- ened into stupor the next day, indicating pressure upon the brain, presuma- bly from the rupture of a small blood vessel. Dr. McCormick called in consultation Drs. Perkins and Hume, and Dr. Parkill, but nothing could be. done to avert death, and she expired at 7 o’clock Friday morning. The case was necessarily rapid in its fatal termination. A notable feature was the. remark- able elevation of temperature. the thermometer registering 109% degrees. We have been thus deﬁnite concerning the case because many erroneous tatements have been made. Mrs. Williams’ maiden name was Mattie Beards- ley. She was married about twelve years ago, at her home in Oakland county, to our prominent and highly esteemed citizen, Mr. Amos Lee Wil- liams. son of' the late A. L. Williams, Esq., of Owosso, and on coming to Owosso identiﬁed herself with the cultivated and literary society of this city, bringing much grace and culture to the circles in which she moved. She was a devoted member of the Baptist church, exerting an active and beneﬁcial inﬂuence, especially upon the young people of the church. She is a loss to society and to her church, but the heavy blow rests upon the desolate hus- band between whom 'and the departed wife there was a remarkable bond of companionship and enjoyment of their beautiful home. She was in the 51st year of her age. Funeral services .were held at the residence Sunday afternoon, at which there was a very large assembly of friends and citizens. Rev. Mr. Donnelly, pastor of the Baptist church, conducted the services. There were present, relatives, Mr. and Mrs. Dewey and Mrs. Gunning, of Detroit, Miss Lottie Beardsley, Mrs. and Miss Irwin, Mr. Ira Beardsley and vMisses Beardsley. of Southﬁeld, Mr. Irwin and daughter, of Walled Lake, Mrs. Phelps and son, of Flint; also relatives from Bennington and Saginaw City.

March 13, 1825. In the fall of 1824 Mrs. Williams was one of a party of young friends, among whom was Mr. E. S. Williams, to whom she was afterwards married, who rode on horseback to Grand Blanc on a visit to Mrs. Rufus W. Stevens, a sister of Mr. Williams, thence. from Grand Blanc to the present city of Flint. The company fol- lowed an Indian trail. then the only road of travel; crossed the river on the then rapids and where now is the mill dam. and standing upon the north bank viewed the beautiful spot for the future city of Flint, where she, after an eventful life, lived many years and died. After her marriage Mrs. Williams and family resided in Saginaw City from the fall of 1829 to the spring of 1840; then after a few years passed in Detroit and Pontiac, made their home in Flint. At an early age she made a profession of faith in Christ, and for over thirty ﬁve years has been a worthy and honored member of the Methodist Episcopal church. Her life, passed for'the most part in continued bodily suffering. has furnished the highest testimony of the power of divine grace to impart stead- fast patience. cheerful submission, and continued joy of spirit in the midst of the sorest trials and aﬁ‘liction. On the day before her death, with her mental faculties unimpaired, and with that wonderful self forgetfulness and care for others which charac- terizcd her whole life, she talked with her husband, with Mrs. R. W. Jenny, her only sister. and now the only surviving member of a large family, held a long conversation with the physician who had attended her for eighteen or twenty years, thanking him for his kind attention and expressed her perfect satisfaction with his treatment, gathered her children at her bedside and then directed messages for each of the absent ones. Of seven children given her ﬁve yet live; these with her husband, eighteen grandchildren and three great grandchildren mourn the loss of a most devoted and affectionate wife and mother. . Their loss is her eternal gain.

Williams, of Owosso. “For a period of nearly a quarter of a century she has been an almost helpless invalid, and during the whole time she has suffered far beyond that (If any person within our remembrance. and with a christian resignation that challenges admiration. “We very much doubt whether the decease of any lady in this section of the state will recall more pleasant and happy recollections than the subject of this hasty notice. “The hospitality of the whole family of the Williams” at an early day is well known to all who found a home, at that time, in what was familiarly known ‘The Saganau.’ We oﬂ’er our sincere ympathy to her worthy hus- band and children, in the sacred hour of their sorrow." The Saginaw Courier says: “A short sketch of a noble life and an illustri- ous death.” “Something more is necessary to constitute true heroism than the absence of fear in the hour and article of death. The untutored savage can calmly contemplate the preparations for his death by torture, and approach the stake chanting his death song, and die defying his enemies. This may be bravery of a stoical character, but fails in the true moral courage which patiently sustains a sutferer, and that sufferer a poor feeble woman, through a long series of years of cruel torture. in which a life lesson is taught us that true heroism is alone found in an implicit reliance upon the justice and mercy of God. by a faith which soars above earth. and, laughing at impossi- bilities. declares it shall be done. In view of such an instance as this, how pales into insignificance. the glory of the dying gladiator, or the soldier on the battleﬁeld. The sublime spirit of the martyrs of old is still found in the case of those who, with hand clasped in that of God, can say, under all cir- cumstances, ‘It is well!’ ” These reﬂections are suggested by the death of the late Mrs. Hannah M.

I The services at the house "were very impressive; Rev. J. McEldowne'y and Rev. Marcus Lane, Episcopal, were in attendance on Saturday, and made remarks suitable to the occasion. I w ‘ Previous to the death of the lady she strove to sing the verse of a hymn she had selected some years before to be sung at her funeral, but her trem- bling voice 'could but tremulously articulate two lines of the hymn. At the services the choir sang the hymn, as follows: ' SEEKING RELEASE. “Let me go, my soul is weary Of the chains that. bind it. here; Let my spirit bend its pinions To a brighter, holier sphere. Earth, ’tis true, has friends that bless me, With a fond and faithful love, But the arms of angels beckon Me to brighter worlds above. “Let me go, for songs seraphic Now seem calling from the skies; ’Tis the welcome of the angels, Which to me seem hovering nigh.

E. S. Williams, of Flint, died at her residence, corner of Kearsley and Beach streets, Thursday morning, at the ripe age of sixty ﬁve years. Mrs. Williams had been a terrible sufferer for thirty years from the effects of mercurial poison, administered in her early life as a. cure for fever and ague. For a number of years, twenty or more, the poor sufferer has been unable to comb her hair, or to move her body in any direction to help herself, but never lacking assistance, she having a large circle of friends and relatives around her. Her physician, Dr. I. N. Eldridge, of this city, has been attending her for nearly eighteen years, and had kept her in as comfortable circumstances as his ability would permit.

It seems to me that the provisions are a long time delayed, it is time that they arrived so as to send them to the Upper Country before the winter; I fear very much being left in the same predicament as last year when after all my trouble, the most of the provisions remained all winter at Fort William Augustus, without power to send them farther. The Batteaux on Lake Superior are not sufﬁcient. Major Wilkins saw the Commander at Niagara 8: Gladwin at Detroit, the former major of the 80th regiment & the latter major of the 1st Battalion in place of Walters. Gladwin 'can send the same parties into Lake Superior as into all the other lakes. _ Your Quarter Master left this morning for ‘York to distribute the uniforms to your Battalion.

I complained to Monsr de St Ange‘ in a letter from this place giving the Message in the name of Monsr Obrie the .present Governor of New Orleans as it seemed to make a very great alteration in, the Disposi- _tion of all the nations here abouts I Desired that Monsr De St Ange would Contradict it as I could not suspect Monsr Obrie could be capable of advis- ing the Indians to make war with us when we were on such good terms with his nation. But Monsr St Ange has not hitherto made me an answer to this though I had Letters from Him on other Subjects. . It is a great Encouragement to the Indians to continue the war, to see th vast Quantities of Goods that are come up here within these-three weeks past. ‘See appendix

CONDUCT OF, PONTIAC ‘ 217 "The Indians wouldalmost have made peace on our own terms before this Convoy came up, as they were in the greatest want of every thing, but the French who intended to quit New Orleans, as it is Credited to the Spaniards have sent all‘ their Goods up here, and they are Eternally Sparring on the Indians to Continue the War thinking to dispose of it the sooner. The Shops and most of the houses in Town have already crowded with goods before the Arrival of a second Convoy here last night, which has brought a Consider- able Quantity more. I have been insulted by some of the Traders here, and threatened in the plainest terms that I might assure myself if I made the least mention of them to the Indians that I should sutfer for it. I told them that their threats should not in the least alter my resolution ot'v executing my General’s orders & that if I should suffer that they should pay for it. They alledged that I had spoke to the disadvantage of' the Inhab- itants and wanted the Indians to cut their throats, I had no great difﬁculty in proving this Allegation to be false, & I toldlthem that I saw plainly such Stories could never have been invented with any other design than to deprive me 'of my Life & I had seen some instances that conﬁrmed my suspicions in a manner to be true. I had sent away my men the night of the 18th as I proposed, but I thought best to stay behind myself till I should receive some news of Colonel Croghan I kept the Departure of my men so private that scarce an Inhabitant in the place had known of it till they were two days on their journey. Pondiach was the ﬁrst whom I acquainted of it. I told him that my reasons were that I had no proVisions nor Cloathing to g'ive them, and that the Indians had always beat them when they got drunk. He told me it was very well, that I had done very right. But the Merchants who had threatened me the day be- fore had him to dine with them, ﬁlled him Drunk, and soon afterwards I (as \ well as my Servant) was taken prisoner. He and his men fought all night about us he was reproached by them for having allowed my men to got off, they said that we would got 011“ next day if they should not prevent our ﬂight by killing us. Thus Pondiach would not do. All night they did nothing else but sing the Death Song but my Servant & I with the help of an Indian who was sober defended ourselves till morning when they thought proper to let us escape. When Pondiach was sober he made me an Apology for his behavior, and told me it was owing to bad Counsel he had got. that he had taken me. but that I'need not fear being taken in that manner for the future. He told me if I chose to go to his village that he Expected to meet the Chiefs who had gone away there, and as they had promis'd to await the arrival of Mr. Grog- han at that place. that after he would hold a. Council with Him he would go with me & deliver me safe to the Commanding Oﬂicer at Detroit he begg’d I 28

218 CONDITION OF FORT would let him know whether that should be more agreeable to me than going down the river. I chose the later and be approved of it and beg’d I would give him a Let- ter to you Sir to acquaint you of his having saved my Life as well as those of my men several times. He told me if this nation on the Ohio had made peace (as I assured them they had) that he would make peace also how soon he would see them. I gave him some Presents and I intend to sett oﬁ in a day or two as I can learn no news of Mr Croghan, and that I have the General’s Instructions for going down the river to meet Major Farmar. I think the Indians seem at present very well inclined to peace, and if Mr Chrogan ha put matters on a good footing with the nation on the Ohio and comes to this country, I do not doubt but that he may ﬁx a solid Peace with them, but as the French in this Colony are so capable of makingithem do what they please, I think Sir that you ought to be on your guard against them without shew- ing any Suspicion, as they are all unanimous they will begin the War again or make a General peace soon. Monsr St. Ange has held several Councils with them but I would not suspect him of any evil designs or giving them had Counsels as he always spoke all he could 'for our Interests, when I was present. But Monsr Obries giving Permits for taking 0 much Goods into this Country at present gives reason to suspect what the Shawanese had.told the Indians to be not entirely without foundation. If he had delayed the Convoy two or three days, one Monsr Gotterie a French oﬂicer could come along with it who is employed to settle a peace with the Indians in our behalf. The French say that the Arcansa Indians intend to take his presents from him, and send himself back. I have the honour to be Sir 8:0. (signed) ALEXR Fasssn.

I repeat that it is not in my power to remit any one article of the King's Rights of which I shall write more fully hereafter.

222 ATTITUDE OF FRENCH AND CANADIANS LIEU'I‘. GOV. CARLETON TO SIR “’M. JOHNSON. BT. \ QUEBEC 27th March 1767. Sm, I received the Favor of your Letter of the 27th of January, and shall allways think myself obliged to you for informing me of any irregularities committed by Persons from this Province, as by that Information I may be enabled to take such steps here, as may correct them for the future, and assist you in your Endeavours to prevent all Cause of Discontent to the I Indians from hence: in Return I will' communicate to you the complaints which I receive_here, as I imagine this mutual Information must be of advantage to His Majesty’s Service. whose Intentions are, that His Servants should promote the good of all His Subjects, as well as prevent any just cause of Discontent, to those under his Protection. That the French who must allways be our Rivals in Trade. often our open Enemies, should take every opportunity of gaining the affection of the Indians, and of misrepresenting us, I expect as a Thing of course; it belongs to us to defeat their Endeavours, whether fair or fraudulent. and by wise Regulations, honest dealing, and by kind Treatment to attach them to us, and avail ourselves of those Extensive Channels of Trade, to enlarge our Commerce to the utmost. Your complaints of the Canadians, by which name.I distinguish the Sub- jects of the King our Master, acquired by the Conquest of this Province, are 50 general that I can only make my Enquiries, and speak to them in as general a manner; When I talk here of that Perﬁdy, false Stories, or views of exciting an Indian War, you complain of, they appeal to Colonel Gladwin, and all the rest of our ofﬁcers, who were Spectators of the last, and are conﬁdent these will give Testimony of very different Dispositions in them at that Time, when such views might have been more excusable, than at present, and that even then some of them were utterly ruined by the Indians for their attachment to us; they very plainly shew me. that such a War must be very destructive to them, and in case of such a Misfortune, that they then did, and would again cheerfully take up arms, to reduce them to Peace, by Force. Ever since my arrival, I have observed the Canadians with an attention bordering upon suspicion. but hitherto have not discovered in them either actions or Sentiments, which do not belong to good subjects. Whether they are right or wrong in their opinion of the Indian Trade, I submit to those whom the King has appointed to direct and superintend the same, but the unanimous opinion of all here, Canadians and British, is, that unless the present Restraints are taken off, that Trade must greatly suffer. this Province. be nearly ruined, Great Britain be a considerable Loser, and

RELATIONS OF KING’S SUBJECTS 223 France the sole Gainer, as they must turn the greatest Part of the Furrs down the Mississippi, instead of the St. Lawrence, they compute that or very large Quantity of Merchandise, formerly passed thro’ this Province to Nations unknown to Pondiac, and too distant to come to any of our Posts, and that so much is lost of the consumption of British Manufacturers. They say that their own Interest will allways be a sufﬁcient Reason and Motive to treat these people well, and to use their utmost Endeavors to keep them in Peace. and the Canadians will engage to take some English in every Canoe. to acquire a knowledge of these Countries, and the Language, to shew they have no Jealousy at their becoming acquainted with this Trade. ’Tis imag- ined here, that the other Provinces, who are neither acquainted with these Countries, nor so advantageously situated for this Trade are the secret causes of their being so severely fettered; they presume to think each Province should be permitted to avail itself of its natural Situation, and acquired advantages, and that it would be as unreasonable in us to expect the Posts to the Southward should be but up by Regulations, as long as ours are by a severe climate; that in this Respect all the King’s Subjects should be consid- ered as Brothers, or one Family, and that the Rivalship ought not to be between Province and Province, but between the King’s Subjects and those of France and Spain; some have offered to prove, that two years ago. while they were conﬁned to the Fort, the French or Spaniards from the Mississippi came within twenty Leagues of the Detroit, and carried of the very Furs, that were intended to clear off the Credit given the Indians the year before. They even assert ’tis impossible to pre- vent them from carrying oﬂ? by far the greatest Part of that Trade unless those Restraints are taken off, they maintain that the only possible Means of . preventing those Evils for the future, and of removing the Discontents of the Indians, for not being supplied with the necessaries of Life as formerly, is to permit them to go among them as was the Practice of thi Colony, that thereby they will be enabled to undersell the Mississippi Traders, detect their Artiﬁces, and be the means of bringing them to Punishment, as it is their Interest and Duty so to do; but supposing the worst of them, they hope the King’s Subjects of Canada are as much to be trusted. as the French from New Orleans, and ought to have the Preference, considering they carry up the British Manufactures only. I have also had many Complaints of the Partiality and. Violence of some Commissaries, but as I ﬁnd by your Letters to Lieutenant Colonel Massey, you are already informed of them, I will not trouble you with a Repitition. not doubting but they will be properly punished, if they are found Guilty, the British in particular request, that for the future these may all be obliged to

226 CONDUCT OF MAJOR ROGERS ant of the Fort of Michilimackinac, and that from that Time till this last Summer he has continued to be much connected with him, and employed by him in various ways. That he has several Times observed that the said Major Rogers was much dissatisﬁed with his Situation and expressed a distant Design of taking some extraordinary Methods to better it. That the said Major Rogers sent the said Potter last Spring to Lake Superior, from whence he returned, about the latter end of last June—and in July last the said Major Rogers had a private conversation with the said 'Mr. Potter at the Fort at Michilimakinac, in which he explained his Designs to the said Potter in a fuller Manner than he had ever done before. He said he was much in Debt to several Traders, whom he was unable to pay, and that this gave him great uneasiness. That he was therefore resolved to apply to the Government of England to do something to better his Situation, and that he wished they.would erect the Country about Michilimakinac into a separate Province, and make him Governor of it, with a Command of three Companies of Rangers, Independant of Sir William Johnson or the Com- mander in Chief of the Forces in America, that this would atisfy him and make him easy; and nothing else would: and he proposed to Mr. Potter to go to England to make these Proposals to the English Government in his behalf, and to let him know in the speediest Manner possible the success of his Negotiation, for that, if he did not meet with success he would imme- diately upon receiving notice of his Disappointment, quit his Post and retire to the French towards the Missisipi and enter into the service of the French where he was sure to meet with better Encouragement: That he had lately had a Letter from one Hopkins. who is now in the French Service in one of their West Indian Islands: That in that Letter Hopkins had offered him great Encouragement if he would embrace the French Interest and stir up the Indians against the English; That he was sure he would get great, Riches and be a great Man if he was to go over to the French, and therefore he was resolved to do so if the English Government did not comply with his Proposals; and that he advised Potter to do the same as it would be much for his Interest; That up‘on Potter’s expressing some surprise and Indignation at this Proposal, as being contrary to his Duty and Conscience, Rogers told him he was a fool; that he had hitherto taken him for a man of sense and his Friend that would join in any Scheme to serve him; but that. now he found he was mistaken; But he said that for himself he was resolved to do so if his Proposals were not complyed with; and he added that if he did take that step and retire among the Indians and French, he would not go empty handed, but would in that Case get into his Hands, all the Goods he could both from Traders and others, by right or wrong. he cared
Page 227
CONDUCT OF MAJOR ROGERS 227 nbt how; and he said that he had already made Preparations for such a step, by appointing people to meet him at a place called Louis Constant,“ near a River that falls vinto the Missisipi.-When Potter refused to engage with Rogers in this Design, the latter ﬂew into a violent Passion, and swore that he would never pay him a Farthing of what he owed him, and said that he supposed since he would not join with him in his Design he would go and reveal it. but that if he did he would certainly kill him. Potter answered him that he had allways served him faithfully. and wished to do so still, and had no Inclination to reveal anything that might turn to his Prejudice; but as he seemed to be so ﬁrmly resolved to take such a dangerous Step, that might be the cause of a new Indian War, or other dreadful Misfortune to the Interests of Great Britain. he apprehended himself to be bound in conscience and by Duty which he owed his Country to give intelligence of it to proper Persons; in order to prevent its taking Place. Rogers upon this took up an Indian Spear that was in his Room in which the Conversation passed, and pointed it at Potter, threatening him with instant Death, if he did not swear to keep this Matter secret. Potter seeing his Life in Danger, cried out for help, but was not heard; upon which he fell down upon his knees and begged Rogers to spare his Life ’till the next Day. when they might confer together upon the Subject again. he hoped with mutual Satisfaction. This made Rogers grow somewhat cooler, he then pressed Potter to give him up a Note of Hand for Fifty ﬁve Pounds, twelve Shillings Sterling, which he had given him in New York, and likewise to give him Discharges for Several Sums of Money, which he owed Potter, and which he knew Potter had set down in his Books of Accounts. But Potter did not comply with these Demands. Soon after Rogers opened the Door and went down one of the Steps that were before it; and Potter thinking this a good Opportunity to get out of his Company endeavored to push by him, and get out of the House; But Rogers would not let him go without Blows; He struck him and kicked him saying, “Damm you, you shan’t come out yet; I’ll Cook you, I’ll War- rant you,” besides other very foul Language. However by this Means Potter at last got out of the House. and went to his own Lodging. The People were all exceedingly surprised at this Behaviour of Rogers, as they had imagined that Potter had been a great Friend and Favor- Q ite of Rogers, as in Truth he had been ’till this extraordinary Conver- sation, which he did not at that Time communicate to 'any Body. The next day Potter went out to take a walk; and during this short ab- sence, Rogers took from Potter’s Lodging a Silver hilted sword worth six Guineas. a Fowling Piece, twenty Pounds weight of Beaver Skins, a Hat, and other wearing apparel. Potter upon his Return from his Walk met 'See appendix

0-13 CONDUCT OF MAJOR ROGERS Rogers on the Parade, who asked him what he thought of Things then, Potter answered that he continued in the same way of thinking as the Day before; which put Rogers into a. violent Passion, and made him Swear that he would not let Potter go out of the Garrison. Potter went home and did not yet tell what had passed. The third Day Rogers again asked Potter what his thoughts were upon the Matters he had proposed to him, who again refused to join with him in his Designs; Whereupon Rogers knocked him down, and bid the Guard take care of him; But they, seeing that Rogers was in a. violent Passion when he gave this order, did not obey it, and Potter was not conﬁned. but went home strait to his Lodging. Then several Persons who had been Witnesses of the ill Treatment he had received from Rogers and were both surprised and shocked at it, went to see him; and amongst the rest Mr. Roberts the Commissary, who advised him to apply to Captain Spicemaker,‘ the Commanding ofﬁcer of the Troops, for Protection. Potter did so and received the Captains Protection, and received'no further Injury from Rogers after that Time. On the twenty ninth of August last he left Michilimakinac, and some Days, or the Day before, he acquainted Mr. — Roberts the Commissary, with Roger‘s private conversation above mentioned. which had been the occasion of their Quarrel. Before he left Michilimakinac Rogers sent him word that, if he would not hurt him, he would pay him hi Debt. Potter supposes that by the Expression if he would not hurt Mm Rogers must have meant, if he would not disco‘ver the aforesaid private conversation. Rogers never returned him the Sword, and hat, and Beaver Skins, and other things that were taken out of his Room. Potter says that Rogers is in Debt to almost all the Traders about Michilimakinac, to the amount of a hundred thousand French Livres, all which Debts have been contracted since he has been at Michilimakinac. He says that Rogers told him in the conversation aforesaid that he had sent eleven Canoes loaded with Goods to Lake Superior and Lake ‘ [Michigan] ' " and other Places of Indian Trade, Potter says that, Rogers seems to him to be cultivating an interest with the Indians in order to retreat to them, when he shall excute his Purpose of leaving the British Services; and he suspects that one Stoote and one Atherton design to go off with him.

MY Loan, We, Citizens & Inhabitants of Detroit, seeing the publication made and posted up the 14th May of the present year in the name of Cap- tain annbull, Commandant of this place, by which we have learned that His Majesty. by the advice of his Council has given an order to Mr. Macdou- gal to possess, cultivate and enjoy Hog Island. seeing at the same time a pro- hibition of my said Mr. Macdougal to the Public from bringing there any animals 8: the order to take away all those which may be there under pain of a ﬁne &c. _ Having the honor of representing to you the notable wrongs which the pub- lic would sustain by such a cession, if they can have the ground; His Majesty as well as his council cannot be informed of the right which we, inhabitants of the country have in this Island. We pray you very respectfully to con- sider that the Island in question is a common ceded to the public by the late M. de la Motte, ﬁrst Commandant of the Country, to keep the cattle in safety, that this right lasted until now without having been chalenged, then ' that Mr. de Tonty since become Commandant undertook to appropriate it, but a request of the Public forced him immediately to abandon it. Mr. De Quindre under the order of Mr. de Celeron on account of his family 8: his personal merit obtained also the ownership; but the earnest representation the public deprived him of the possession. Wherefore we faithful subjects of His Majesty earnestly pray Your Excel- lency to support & make good our rights and perogatives preserved to us by our former Sovereigns, in order that they be continued to us under the present Government, we pray you at the same time to consider how hard it would be for the ancient Inhabitants and faithful subjects of His Majesty to see themselves stript of their rights and privileges in favour of a tranger come into this country. We hope that in presenting our demands and supporting them with your credit we will obtain entire satisfaction on this subject & that the said Island will remainv in common. as it has been since the establishment of this Colony. The Petitioners have the honor to assure your Excellency of the profound respect with which they are Your very humble 81c very obedient Servants Detroit the 16th May 1769.

PETITION .- 239 1 the King’s Magazin at Fort Ontario, as appears by the inclosed receipt from Captain Wilson ofﬁcer of Artillery at the said Fort Ontario. Mr Lottridge promised me that he would deliver'it at the risk & expence to Mr Digonaique at Niagara, & then leave for Albany but by the unsettled state of his affairs he has not been able to send the said powder nor the rest as he had promised; therefore I remain until now unable to obtain what Mr Lottridge owes me, & for which I have given him my note on his word. This determined me last year to charge my attorney Mr Edgard of this post to pursue, if he had the means, Mr Lottridge 8: make him fulﬁl his bargain. The said Mr Edgard passing Niagara found that Mr Lottridge had not delivered at Niagara the powder & other etfects in question. He was told by Capt Brocor Commandant of this Post that there was a quantity of powder belonging to private parties which had been transported from Fort Ontario to Niagara & deposited in the King’s Store by order of Your Excel- lency, and as he cannot deliver the said powder without an order for the price from Your Excellency, permit me to observe that I (gave) made my note for the value of this powder 8; a quantity of lead 8: fusils. that the said Mr Lottridge delivered at Niagara. That my note has been sent to Mr Walker at Montreal who has sent to demand payment. As I do not know if the powder was delivered at Niagara according to agreement I have refused to pay, seeing that Mr Lottridge has not sent me my goods of which I know nothing except that Mr Walker has my note & now keeps from me nearly £140 which belongs to me, this is why I ask Your Excellency if you will be good enough to give me an order on which Captain Brocor will give me my powder under the mark. I ask to have the honor to assure Your Excellency of my profound respect Your very humble & very obedient Servant (signed) . B. CHAPO'I‘ON. DETROIT the 12th August 1769.

Mc- Dougal by order of the Honble. Major Bruce Commanding ofﬁcer of Detroit 8: its Dependencies relating to a Memorial sent by the Inhabitants to General
Page 240
240 RELATIVE TO HOG ISLAND Gage setting forth their claim to Hogg Island as a Common; The ﬁrst Ques- tion put to the Inhabitants by Major Bruce was if they had any Writing to shew to prove their Pretentious, their answer was they had none, but they had liberty to put their cattle there for ﬁfty or sixty years past. which they Imagined gave them a Right as a Common and that the Island was given to Mr Degnand in the year 1752, but on their Representation his Deed was di- annull'd which strengthened their opinion and that they had wrote to Mon- treal 8: Quebeck to have the Records of that Province earch’d to see if it was mark’d there but they had got no answer except a Letter from Mr. Baby ac- quainting them that he had caused the Rechords to be searched into but had found nothing relating to the Island in their favour, that it was Recorded to have been given to Mr. Degnands but scratch’d out again and no mention made of its being given to the Publick of Detroit; They also procured an answer of a Letter from General Gage wherein he promised every thing in his Power & that he had wrote to General Carleton to have the Records look’d narrowly into. and that if he should ﬁnd anything to their advantage shou’d acquaint them immediately of it. Major Bruce asked Lieut. McDougal if he had anything to say to confute their allegation, He answered that any thing they had advanced did not merit an answer untill they produced a Grant of the Island as they pretended to have as they set forth in their memorial to General Gage, but with the Major‘s Leave he shou’d be glad to ask them some Questions, as it is well known here they never had a Right to that Island during the Time of the French. but they may make some false preten- sions on purpose to give trouble Lieut McDougal asked them who gave Liberty. to one Mr. Pilet 8; Mr. Campau to live 8: cultivate the Island during the French, about six or eight years before we took Possession of this Country, they imagined it was the Commandg oﬂicer; . Mr. McDougal told them it was very extraordinary he could give these people Liberty to cultivate the Lands of the Publick 8; if it was their Right why did they \ask the Liberty of every Commanding Ofﬁcer since the English had Possession of this Country to put their Cattle on the Island as proved by Mr. Hay the time he‘ has been here, they answered they were new subjects and were afraid; Mr. McDougal asked them why they did not ﬁnd fault with Lieut McDonald for Labouring the Lands on the Island in the years 1761: 2 8: 3 they answered as above. He asked them why they did not produce their claim to the Commanding otlicer and stop him (Lieut McDougal) from Building a House clearing ground. and setting a family on the Island in the year 1762 & 3 which was but off during the last Indian \Va-r, they answered still as above. Lieut McDougal also asked them why they did not ﬁnd fault with the Commanding ofﬁcer for giving a Farm to Mr. Bondy behind the
Page 241
RELATIVE TO HOG ISLAND 241 Fort in the year 1764, which they claim. an equal Right to as the Island, their answer was, the Commanding oﬂicer was Master; he also asked them why they did not ﬁnd fault with giving two acres in Breadth and forty in Length to Mr. St. Martin Lands of the King‘s Domain which they say is their Right also as the Island, they answer as above, Lieut McDougal told them then that he understood them well, that the Commanding oﬂicer was Master to give what he pleased to the french, but they did not allow the King of Eng- land to have the same Liberty to give to an Englishman Lieut. McDougal also produced to the Major the order he had from His Majesty 8: Council, He also acquainted him that the General had given positive orders to the Com- manding ofﬁcer of Detroit that he should not permit him (Lieut. McDougal) or any of his friends, in his absence to take possession of that Island nntill he should receive a Deed from the Savages for the same. and that every expence incurr‘d on that head should be the sole acct of Mr. McDougal he had the Savages called together last spring in Council in presance of the Commanding otﬁcer and all the ofﬁcers of the Garrison. at that time he Received a solemn Deed for that Island. which cost him very considerably both in Presents and Provisions, but it being the General’s orders he obey’d this the Inhabitants knew nine months before it was done, and on receiving the Deed the Commanding oﬂicer gave him Possession of the Island in Form. The Commanding Oﬂicer and all the oﬂicers of this Garrison at present. have been here this three years Declare that they always looked on that Island as the King’s and that the Inhabitants never attempted to put their Cattle or cut Bay on the Island without leave from the Commanding oﬂicer. or cut wood on the Island on any account whatever.

Page 242
242 I RELATIVE TO HOG ISLAND That your Memorialist got an order of His Majesty and Council for Hog Island, situated and lying in Detroit River, Three Miles above the Fort of Detroit, provided that it could be done without giving umbrage to the Indians, and on consideration the Improvements projected by the Petitioner be applyed to the more effectual and easy supply of his Majesty’s Fort and Garrison at Detroit. But as no absolute Grant could be given to your Memorialist (Detroit being out of the boundary laid down by His Majesty and Parliament in the year 1763. He was contented to accept of an order of Council judging it equally good as a real Deed; and that His Majesty and Council referred the same to the Commander in Chief for the time being, to put your Mem- orialist in possession of said Island, or not; according as he judged it equitable. The Commander in Chief ordered the Commanding oﬁicer at Detroit to put your Memorialist in possession of the Island after fulﬁlling the General’s orders. A copy of which I herewith transmit to your Lordship. Your Memorialist had the Indians called together the fourth of May 1769 _ in council in presence of the Commanding ofﬁcer and all the ofﬁcers of the Gar- rison, at which time he received a Solemn Deed for the said Island; which cost him very considerably both in presents and provisions, it being the Com- mander in Chief’s orders to have such a Deed from the Indians. The French Inhabitants knew I had an order from His Majesty and Council for the Island nine months before I received the Deed from the Indians, in which time they never made the least objection to my possessing the Island, and I even had almost ﬁnished my house on the Island before the Inhabitants made any com- plaint; On your Memorialist receiving the Deed from the Indians the Com- manding oﬂicer gave him possession of .the Island in form agreeable to the General’s orders. A Copy of the Indian Grant I herewith transmit to your Lordship, also transmit your Lordship a copy of Questions put to the Inhab- itants with their answers the 13th of October 1769, by order of the Hon. Major Thomas Bruce Commanding ofﬁcer of Detroit on his arrival here, be having received orders from the Commander in Chief to do so. When your Memorialist got possession of the Island he engaged an English family to settle with him, which they now are, & has made very great improvements which cost us very considerably, in clearing ground and Build- ing tho’ neither of us as yet has reaped the least beneﬁt nor do expect for one year to come. Your Memorialist was not the ﬁrst that petitioned for that Island, there was two Memorials before His Majesty and Council, two or three years before mine. One by Lieut Mant, who had got a Deed for the Island by Colonel Broadstreet in the year 1764 when the Colonel was here settling the attairs of the Indian War, and the other Memorial signed by
Page 243
RELATIVE TO HOG ISLAND 243 Lieut. Abbott of the Royal Artillery. Those Memorials I still believe lies at the Council Chamber. If your Memorialist had ever known that the Inhab- itants of Detroit would have made the least claim to that Island, he never would have apply’d for it; but as he had made. no improvements on said Island, and had lost so much by it, he thought in reason to have the said Island. ' Colonel Gladwin was Commanding oﬂicerlhere from the year‘1762 to the year 1764, who I am certain will declare that the Inhabitants (while he com- manded) never pretended to have the least Title or claim to the Island in Question, it being his publick orders that they should not put their Cattle on the Island, without his liberty, nor should they cut wood nor Hay on the Island on any pretense whatever (he is now in England) Col Campbell 17th Regmt. who succeeded him in the Command commanded till August 1766 gave out the same orders; Capt. Turnbull, 60th Regiment who signs the Inclosed paper has commanded here upward of three years gave out the same orders; While none of the Inhabitants ever made any pretentious to said Island, nor did they ever so much as whisper that it was their property; for if they had, as I said before, Your Memorialist never would apply’d for it. Your Memorialist humbly conceives that he has fulﬁlled the Intention of His Majesty 8: Council with the aprobation & order of the Commander in Chief to whom it Was referred, therefore he looks upon the Island as his pro- perty agreeable to'the order of His Majesty and Council. Otherwise your Memorialist never would have laid out so much money in Improvements. Your Memorialist is well informed that the Inhabitants (now claiming a right to that Island as a common) cannot produce any title thereto, or is any thing of the kind mentioned in the Registers of this place or Canada. Your Memorialist humbly Implores your Lordships protection and favour, and begs that Your Lordship will not press him to refer his property to arbitration. Your Memorialist in duty bound shall ever pray 8:0. 8:0. Endorsed:—In Lieut. McDougal’s of 29th May 1770. [Q 7 P 112] . LIEUTENANT MCDOUGAL TO THE EARL OF HILLSBOROUGH DETROIT 29th May 1770.

GRANTS OF LANDS 245 FROM GENERAL GAGE. U.\'.\I)I)RESSED New Your; April 8th 1771. Sm, Your letters of the 14th and 18th December are very full on the sub- ject of Grants, & Lands at the Detroit. I am to explain to you that the King has not invested any Person whatever with the power of granting Lands in America. except to his Governors. within the limits of their respective Provinces, 8: under certain forms and restrictions. and where any Purchae is made of the Indians tho’ within the limits of the Provinces they are not valid, unless permission is given so to do, 8: the Purchase made in presence of the Governor & His Majesty’s Superintendant of Indian Affairs. From hence you will know the power of granting Lands at Detroit remainssolely in the King. & that no purchase can be made of the Indians but with the King’s permission & authority. It may he needless after the above explanation to inform you that all grants made by Lieut: Colonel Gladwin, Major Bruce or any other British Com- mander are null & void 8: of no value. As for the French Grants in general unless approved of by the Governor General of Canada & registered accordingly they were not valid but as for Monsieur Belestre’s grants in the year 1760, they cannot be deemed any other than fraudelent, and are by no means to be looked upon as valid. And as for the Indian purchases they were not allowed by the French, nor are they allowed by the English Government but under the Restrictions I have already mentioned. I Monsr Navarre’s Declaration or Certiﬁcate may be in part true. but it is not the whole truth. The ﬁrst settlers with Mr. Salvrevrés. were not perhaps enjoined to the conditions imposed afterwards, respecting their titles—The Govt was glad to get any people to begin the settlement. But Monsr Navarre’s conclusion is vague & ill founded. I am well informed in those matters, was Three Years in possession of the Books wherein the Titles were registered 8: received information upon them—The very time in which Mr Bélestre’s Grants were made sufﬁciently points out their being invalid & that they would not be registered when the whole Govt of Canada was on the point of surrendering to the King & the Capital possessed by his troops so early as September 1759. Monsr Béléstré was not ignorant of those circum- stances and his grants are fradelent. I am not to require of you, as soon as this is received annul 8: make word by Public Act every concession made by Monsr Béléstré in the year 1760. every grant‘made by every British Commander, without exception. and all Indian Purchases whatever or Indian Deeds not obtained by the King's
Page 246
t 246 GENERAL DIRECTIONS permission and authority—And that you do not suffer any settlements to be made with the above Titles or any new settlements to he began on any pre- tense whatever, and that you pull down as fast as any Person shall presume to build np—And that you do seize and send down the Country all Persons who shall be endeavouring to settle among the Savages. I imagine the Indians will be set upon to talk to you upon these subjects, you will answer them that the King is tender of their property 8: has made regulations to prevent their being cheated and defrauded. That His Majesty has been induced to make these Rules upon the frequent complaints of the Indians against the white People who have defrauded them of their lands by making a few of them drunk & getting them in that condition to give away their country to the great disgust 0f the rest of the Nation, and that by such means the Indians have represented that the White People have taken a great part of their hunting grounds. ’ This has happened to many Indian Nations 8: unless you stop it in the beginning at the Detroit, the same thing will happen there. Mr. Grant has engaged to build two vessels for the King, in which business you will please assist him, and give him such help as your Garrison affords, whenever he shall demand it. As for the Merchants they may build what vessels they please. but you will not suffer Mr. Grant’s Artiﬁcers or Sailors to be taken from himf You have acted very properly in that respect already. I understand there is very good Cedar to be had which Mr. Grant will make use of for the King’s vessels, and if you ﬁnd it necessary you will reserve the Cedar and suﬁer no person to cut it. but when it is to be used in the King’s service. ' I hope that you have received the orders about ﬁtting out the old vessels for this years service. You must continue to take every p’recaution against accidents from Fire, if Mr. Babie’s Stables are 0 near the Magazine as you represent it must be deemed a nuisance & removed accordingly. I am &c., (signed) Tuos Gash. P. S.—The Merchants alledge that there is Cedar to be had in the great- est plenty. It that is the real case I can have no objection to their cutting as much as they want of it, and you will not obstruct them, on that or any other business not detrimental to the service. ' T. G.

I have since received yours of the 16th of June & must observe to you that so many various reports being constantly spread amongst the Indians & White People. it is Necessary to be very Cautious of giving always credit to them, and to take all possible precautions to have true Intelligence’s and to come att the source of the Reports previous to Informations, which at this great Distance, might be attended with prodigious Inconveniences, taking at the same Time such Precautions as to prevent even an attempt similar to that which took place some years ago, at your present Post, I shall always be glad of all Informations you can procure concerning the Indian Nations 8: their Dispositions towards us and towards one another. I have ordered the payment of the Account of the Expenditures to the Indians, and approve that their Interpreter should Continue to receive one ration per day, till further orders and hope he may by his Behaviour in his . ofﬁce merit the Continuance of it.

The present ferment amongst the Indians makes it necessary to behave ' with the utmost caution with them, what has happened formerly must make you sensible of the Necessity of mistruting them, at the same time not to shew any ill Timed Diﬂldence, so as to give offence. I need not suggest to you what measures to take with them, your own prudence & the experience we have of what they can do, must be your guides, and I must desire to be informed by all opportunities of every occurrence, and every material intelli~ gence you will be able to procure.

RELATIVE TO THE POST OF DETROIT 265 my letters to the 16th of June had been received. In obedience to His Ex- cellency’s orders. I immediately-on my arrival here (which was 0n the 9th of November last) directed the putting in repair His Majesty's Vessels lying here. As soon as the severity of the Season would permit. they were ordered to their Stations. being ﬁtted for the purposes of t'ansporting Stores and Provisions. and also for defence. As soon as the Frost would allow, the Repairs of the Fort were undertaken. which went on but slowly. as the Gar- rison consisted only of two companies of the King's (or 8th Regiment) Had the (‘ountry people been employed as Laborers. they must have had provision from the King‘s stores, and the communication from Montreal being cut olf by the Rebels. it could not be spared. The Savages who resorted hither in great numbers in the Spring, consumed at large quantity. and the Militia em- ployed to reinforce the crews of the Vessels. encreased the consumption. At this present time there are not two barrels of Pork in the King‘s Stores, but one of the Vessels loaded with Provisions. is in the River of Detroit, and is expected to arrive to-morrow. ()n the 29th of July I signed a contract for supplying the Garrison with fresh Provision, and the same day a Vessel arrived from the Post of Michilli- \mackinac. with the news of the Rebels being driven out 'of (.‘anada. The Fort is in a tolerable state of defence at present, against Savages, or an Enemy unprovided with Cannon. A stockade of 1200 Paces in extent. forti- ﬁed with 11 Block houses and Batteries, would require for its defence a larger garrison than two Companies. but as there is at preséht a Ditch with fraising nearly compleated on two sides of the citadel. some men could be spared toﬂthe weaker parts. The Stockades which are of cedar 15 feet high, are mostly new. and the artiﬁcers among the Soldiery and Inhabitants are employedlin the construction of new Block houses and Batteries. The old were Iiigh rot- ten. The Virginians have been tampering with the Savages, and have threat- ened frequently to attack the place. but hitherto have not been able to suc- ceed with the former, or undertake the latter. As'I have been very closely attached to-the Fort since my arrival, and my time been much employed in attention to the Savages. it would be improper for me to attempt giving your Lordship any but a general idea of the state of this settlement. I hope to. be able when the present troubles subside, to make some enquiries. and gain such \lufor'mation as not to be entirely at a loss, should your Lordship honor me with your commands. I shall yet be apprehensive of failing in my desire to convey information to your Lordship, and tho’ on the spot. shall be happy to have objects of enquiry pointed out to me.

266 FARMING—CLIMATE outgo the Canadians, that I am persuaded the latter will in a very few years he dependants on or brought out of their possessions by the former—The navi- gating the Lakes in large Vessels, is entirely in the hands of the new Settlers, the new Settlers manage their Farms to the best advantage—The Canadians are mostly so illeterate that few can read, and very few can sign their own names. ’till the surrender of the country to the English the breeding of sheep was not known here and horned cattle were very rare, at present I am told there are about 2000 sheep and 3000 head of black cattle in the Settlement. This backwardness in the improvement of farming has probably been owing to the easy and lazy method of procuring bare necessaries in this Settlement—Wood was at hand, the Inhabitants therefore neglected to raise stone and burn lime which is to be had at their doors—The straight (which at the Town of Detroit is 1000 yards over) is so plentifully stocked with variety of ﬁne ﬁsh that a few hours amusement may furnish several families, yet not one French family has got a seine—Hunting and fowling afford food to numbers who are nearly as lazy as the Savages, who are rarely prompted to the chace till hunger pinches them. The soil is so good that great crops are raised by careless 8: very ignorant farmers, Wheat, Indian Corn, Barley, Oats, Pease. Buck Wheat yield a great increase—Yet there is no such thing as yet, as a'piece of land laid down for Meadow, and the last Winter, indeed a remarkable severe one from this country to the Illinois several of the Cattle perish for want of Fodder—There are very extensive Prairies in the Settlement, but so many natural advantages have hitherto appeared rather to encourage sloth than excite Industry—The great advantage to be drawn - from the management of bees, has never induced any to try them here, tho there are wild bees in great numbers, and the woods are full of blossoming shrubs, wild ﬂowers and aromatic herbs—As to the'Climate, tis by far the most agreable I have ever known. The heat of Summer the great, does not overpower, and is not attended with either the ruinous gusts of wind experienced to the Southward, or the unwholesome vapours complained of usually by those who live near Great Waters. The Lakes are as free from stagnation as the sea, and this vast straight, has a swift current yet knows scarce any difference as to the full- ness of its Bed in Summer and Winter—The Inhabitants may thank the bounty full hand of Providence, -l'or Melons, Peaches, Plumbs, Pears, Apples Mulberries and Grapes, besides several sorts of smaller fruits—several of these grow wild in the woods, those which have got a place in gardens are after being stuck in the ground committed to the care of the climate and soil, so are perpetually degenerating—Hemp & Hops seem natives of almost all America, they might be greatly improved here—There are Salt Springs at
Page 267
SETTLER S—TRADERS 267 a little distance from this place, but I have not yet had time to visit them-— The number of Settlers whites, is about 1500. They build on the borders 'of the Straight, and occupy about 13 miles in length on the North, and 8 on the South side—the houses are all of Log or frame Work, shingled, the most have their orchard adjoining, the appearance of the Settlement is very smiling. On Holy days one would be tempted to think the Inhabitants . were fond of cleanlyness, for they in general dress beyond their means, almost every one has a calash for summer and a cariole for winter. They use Oxen and Horses indifferently for the Plough. As to the Indian trade, all who chuse to engage in it may, without limitation; but here I must entreat your Lordship to excuse me if I should be guilty of great errors in my account, for at the time General Carleton thought proper to send me up, the Rebels had entered Canada, and I crossed the Island of Montreal in a Canadian dress, and got the fourth day in a wooden Canoe to Oswegatchy, unprovided with (I may say) every thing. I was exceedingly struck by the unmoved temper and Firmness of the General. Tho‘ deserted by the most ungrateful race under the sun, tho’ a General without Troops, and at the Eve of quitting Montreal to give entrance to lawless Rebels, his mind appeared unshaken, and he gave me his last orders for the Posts with apparent unconcern, tho’ most undoubtedly be was wrung to the soul. Tho’ I had frequently seen in him instances of uncommon Fortitude, yet nothing of so trying and dis- couraging a nature had perhaps put his Resolution to tryal before, and I be- lieve all who knew him rejoyce sincerely to see him rise superior to so com- plicated distress. Your Lordship will I hope pardon my digression. Regu- lations for the trade with the Indians are either not generally known, or not duly enforced, for Example. great abuses subsist in the Weights and Measures used by the traders, and for want of an office to stamp the Silver works which make a considerable article in the trade with the Savages, they got their trinketts so debased with copper, as to lay open a large ﬁeld for complaint. The number of traders not being limited, allows of many engaging in it, who have no principle of Honesty. and who impose on these poor people in a thousand ways to the detriment of honester and to the disgrace of the name of trader among the Savages, which usually means with them an artful] cheat, the distrust and disgust conceived for these traders occasions many disputes Which frequently end in murder. This trade being lucrative engages several who have little or no capital of their own to procure credit, sometimes to a considerable amount, their ignorance dishonesty (or both) occasion frequent failures, the adventurers ‘then decamp to some other post, where they recom- mence the same tramc, improving in art and villany, and ﬁnally become des- ‘perate in their circumstances, and dangerous from their connexions and interest with the Savages.

In consequence of this; I have told the Savages assembled at this Council, to content themselves. with watchfully observing the Enemy‘s motions. that if the Virginians attacked them. I should give notice to the whole confederacy, and that an attack on one nation should infallibly be followed by the united force of them all to repel or as they term it strike the Virginians—They all appear perfectly satisﬁed. but I am not to rely on their assurances, for as soon as the Council breaks up, I expect to hear of several small parties falling on the scattered settlers on the Ohio, and Rivers which fall into it—a deplorable sort of war, but which the arrogance. disloyalty, and imprudence of the Virgin- ians has justly drawn down upon them] Mr Loan, Before I conclude this (I fear very incorrect and tedious) letter.

I am informed that upon Gaultier‘s hearing that his conduct had been sensured he immediately sold off his goods even at disadvantage in order to Devote himself to the Service. part of which Langlade took for the Indians. Every report conﬁrms that the rebels have drawn to Batteau load of pow- der from the Mississippy by the Wabash under a Guard of a hundred men. This report alarm‘d the Indians here till I prov’d to them that it must go. hard with them when driven to such a necessity. The rebel belt was forwarded from Detroit by the Ottawa Chief, ltowagif- hikee and the Spanish belt was in the hands of Monsr Hubert. and inhabitant of new orleaus formerly in the frenit Service the true nature of the latter is Perhaps still a secret, Hubert said it was to invite the Chiefs of the diﬁerent Nations to assemble at the Spanish fort and hear what their Father had to communicate (iaultier there upon told Mr Hubert that the Indians.on this side the River knew of only one Father and therefore must not listen to his Message several Traders joined him in opposing Hubert who accordingly retir‘d, the Spaniards may perhaps want to settle a peace between our'Indians and theirs but any talks with them at present would greatly alarm the Indi- ans in this Quarter especially as the rebels have so lately appeared in their Dominians. _‘ I am &c &c (signed) A.

' Michilimackinac should be put into a very respectable state, were it not for the impression necessary to make on the numerous Tribes of distant Indians resorting there.

It is probable that the fur Traders, conﬁned for the future, in all circumstances to the channel of Canada, well digested Regulations, & the Posts well attended to & put entirely under the control of the Governor General of Canada, resources may be found from it, that may amply repay the expenses attending all the arrangements necessary to make for the Canada Department.

[B 42 p 36] MR. MONFOBTON TO MR. CIRES DETROIT, 22nd Sept, 1778. To Mr. Cires at the Illinois: Sm, Before leaving Michilimackinac I have done myself the honor of writing to you; uncertain if my letter has found you I repeat by this the part which I have taken in your disgrace, which prevented me from being true to you. I feel warmly & I share all the pain of the bad treatment which. with M. de Rocheblave you have experienced on the part of those who treat
Page 295
CONDUCT OF AMERICANS 295 as enemies the persons whom honor 8: religion held submissive and faithful to their Prince. I I am a Frenchman, what in this capacity only, I owe to M. de Rocheblave —besides his rank 8.: his merit impress me with respect 8: veneration and my gratitude for the marks of good will I have seen on the frequent occasions that I have been with you—interest me equally in his fate and I also deplore the fatal moment in which, without help, he has been surprised and taken, which is reported of a fury which was less to intimidate than to_provoke those whom Captain Lord had conﬁned under his care. Could Captain Lord have chosen a successor who was more worthy of this favour for by his love of justice, his zeal for the public good and his disinter- estedness he has justly merited this title from the Inhabitants of the Illi- nois, whose fate would have been truly deplorable if Providence had not sent prompt assistance to them to help to shake off a yoke which under the appear- ance of a visionary independence they went to impose on them. What advan- tages can_ they draw from this independence? The conduct of the Americans in their invasion of Arkansas 8: other defenceless posts, their contraventions of the rights of men in respect to M. de Rocheblave whose sole motive was to render himself usent to a people, among whom a long frequentation had rendered him dear, has unfortunately felt the effects, whilst the Inhabitants of the Illinois are promised more real advantages than those which they could procure from the British Government. They have not enjoyed them, I acknowledge, under the command of Colonel Wilkins, but the proofs that they have given of their attachment to Captain Lord, the regret which they testiﬁed at his departure seem to have destroyed the false ideas which his predecessor raised in their minds and if, like myself they have occasions for knowing the spirit and character of the English nation they would be fully convinced that the change with which they are threatened can not be fatal in its consequences. You know, Sir, the events and circumstances which have given rise to their prejudices, which. although founded under an Institution as embarrassing, do not fail to divide the minds and opinions in such an unhappy conjuncture. France, it is said, has made a treaty of commerce with the Americans, con- sequently, war will be declared & people ﬂatter themselves on knowing that Canada must be submissive to its laws. The profound and obscure ignorance in which a country so distant scarcely permits wars to arrest the different news which the different interests spread among the public. I cannot nor do I wish to penetrate the secrets of the Cabinet, 8: it belongs to me still less to penetrate the political reasons of France.
Page 296
296 FRENCH—AMERICANS—BRITISH GOVERNMENT I suppose that in the interest of its commerce they have judged proper to make a treaty with the Americans. Have they pretended to engage them to commit hostilities in Canada? If in declaring war she has the intention of rendering herself mistress and that success respond to her enterprise Is it in her interest that the Ainericans have established a dominant power there? Why then alas! Too lavish of their own blood have they come to spill that of so many innocent? The good faith, the honorsthe oath, the religion 8: the authority of their Prince oblige them to oppose their incursion, if they have believed themselves to have any reason to withdraw themselves from their obedience to their Sovereign. The Canadians naturally submit, and, in good faith, can he imagine any pretext to acknowledge them & follow their example without rendering himself guilty of perjuring himself as well as of blacker ingratitude? . Has the British Government neglected anything which might contribute to the happiness of this ‘people? Their wise precautions in the choice of those to whom they conﬁded their authority, their foresight in establishing justice when the administration was always given to those who were judged equally upright and enlightened, their encouragement for the advancement of commerce, which in so short a time has become so ﬂourishing. Is that not a sure guarantee to the Canadians of their happiness? Can the Americans not enjoy the same perogatives which had they been followed by the taxes which according to them, were onerous would have let them have a glimpse of the advantages preferable to those which they hoped for from an independence which they anticipated to purchase by the infusion of blood and for which the most distant posterity would justly reproach them. . This idol to whom they have sacriﬁced many innocent victims has oppressed only too many idolitors in this part of America among whom is counted l‘ere Floquet. If he is guilty of such treason he is doubtless more danger- ous as his correspondence has been for a long time secret. In this case those who have any knowledge of the Institution of the Society of Jesus ought to know the difference between a complete Jesuit and a Jesuit Frank 8: the conduct of Mr. Carleton on that subject is a well authenticated proof that I wish to give to you of the mildness of Government. His Excellency has not taken any other step in a juncture so delicate, than to recommend to his care His Excellency the Bishop. The zeal with which his Excellency with his respectable clergy have been moved to. encourage the faithful, reaSsure the wavering & call back the mis- led leaves nothing more to be feared by His Excellency with respect to Pere Floquet 8: must doubtless destroy in all minds the unhappy prejudices which
Page 297
PERSONAL ASSURANCES 297 he has sown in the minds of a crednlous and ignorant people and of whom a good part have been preserved by the striking example of the nobility of the right-thinking men of Canada, which honor alone has 'armed for the defence of their Prince. . I do not pretend. Sir. to set myself up here nor to give to anyone the lessons that a faithful subject owes to his Prince. I am neither in a position nor in an employment which would engage me to this. Those of your friends of my acquaintance to whom you may communicate the part which I took in your disgrace 8: of my sensibility of the unfortunate State of things which aﬂTicts as equally have need of encouragement to follow your example if any opportunity presents itself to establish you in your rights. from which they were fallen-as much as you, if under the auspices of Mr. de Rocheblave you had the least help.

The 21st September there arrived at the Miamis a man of that nation coming to the river a l’Anguille (Eel River) with the speeches of the (‘hicas- aws, Peans & Virginians. The words of the Chicasaws addressing all the people of the Ouabach as well as the Miamis: My beloved brothers! We have long desired to see you but the Virginians have occupied us, 8; we know that they intend to go to you. We pray you not to receive them but tell them to withdraw from your lands, &c. If you would defend your- solves we will help you—we are worthy of pity, we are not in the enjoyment of an inch of ground for hunting. and if you give them your hand you will be also like us obliged to work the land for a living. We tell you in the name of all the nations our neighbors. 38

We wait for you with great impatience and we invite you to come promptly for at the end of the other moon we will set off to go to see your English Father who is at Detroit.

You may believe that we are numerous and that we will make an end of your father, who is at Detroit. We regard him as a ﬁsh which we are about. to take on the end of a line.

GENERAL INTERESTS 299 REMARKS ON A LETTER OF LIEUT. GOV. HAMILTON Four letters written by Mr. Hamilton to Mr. Cramahe, the one without date, the second and the third of the 12th August. Hogg Island, and the third of the seventeenth in which lie demands some orders. August 11th. A letter sent by express from Niagara to inform me of the taking of the Illinois, received the 8th September. September 9th. A long letter without date received the 27th September, gives a detail of Detroit of the diﬁiculties that the Lt. Govr. encounters there, especially in the exercise of justice. it appears that this is the 1st letter which he ha's written me. this letter should be answered article by article. September 9th. When there shall be time he shall send a copy of all the orders received to the quartermaster general. Of the 9th acknowledges the ﬁrst letter which he has received from me. Of the 16th & 17th Sepr with an enclosure from M. Celoron of the Miamis, he acknowledges the receipt of my letters of the 26th & 27th August and says that he will fulﬁl my intentions concerning the Rebels who have taken post Yincennes, he will accompany the Indians. Capt Lernoult gives him all the assistance possible. He gives notice of his intention to Major de Peystcr and asks him to engage his Indians to cooperate with him by the River Illinois. He believes he can set out the 1st of August and asks me to address my letters under cover to Captain Lernoux. As he sees that the Indians do not look upon the Virginians with pleasure but that the French appear to favor them, there is no time to lose, he will try to anticipate my views in preventing the Rebels from settling themselves solidly at the Illinois. Concerning Bently. Papers have been sent here which render him guilty. He has recalled all the Traders of Sandusky. because he was informed that they were trading with the Rebels. From the 1st of June to the 17th of September the Indians have made 34 prisoners of which they have delivered seventeen to the Lieut. Govr, they have adopted several who are not included in this number. They have taken 81 scalps without committing any cruelty from the 22nd Sept. He says that the Batteaus are ready for his expedition and that in spite of the severity of the winter he hoped to be able to take Post and to maintain it until a reinforcement arrives, a naval engineer and a light cannon would be very useful. He will try to engage the Western Indians to act at the Ohio. He believes it will be a favorable time to found a fort at the meeting of the Mississippi with the Ohio.
Page 300
300 GENERAL INTERESTS He thinks that the Rebels are building at the Falls of the Ohio, the mouth of Teakiky and that of the Missouri, 820. ' ' The Spaniards are weak and hated, the French frivolous and without leaders, the Rebels brave and enterprising but wanting resources; the Indians can receive their supplies only from us. The French at Detroit have set a very good example 8: the arrival of the reinforcement of 80 men from Niagara has produced a very good effect. Major Hay and the other otl'icers of the Militia whom he has named and whOse commissions he sent more than a year ago have not yet been conﬁrmed at Quebec. ‘ I These gentlemen of the Detachment will serve under the grade given them. Lieut. Duvernet of the artillery will be of the party and will make remarks in the same manner as the Lieut Govr. The list of these oﬂicers will be sent in the letter dated the 23d. I He has reassembled the Indians and told them that his hands were tied by my orders and that he was no longer a simple village leader and all these preparations showed to them that he was going to war, he perceived that an attempt had been made to disgust the Indians, and seeing that two Lieuten- ' ants of Militia appeared not to be marching willingly be deprived them of their rank and put them on the roll of the eorvées; the one is Irish and the other French. He made the Militia take the oath, &c., and gave a fete to the Indians. He received notice that Mr. Clark is at Fort Vincennes with 86 Rebel. The Indians of the Ouabache are timid. He asks to be supported in his design of breaking authoritively the sale that the I’eankakass Indians have made of their Lands without the permission of the King. Mr. Gibault the priest has been very active in favour of the Rebels. Mr. Celoron remarks that Jean Baptiste Chapoton (who has been Captain of Militia at Detroit), Bosseron, the younger, and M. Le Gras are on the best possible footing with the Rebels at St. Vincennes. The latter had received many favors from the English, Chapoton also is ungrateful. He intends to leave as soon as possible, Captain Lernoux has sent him some reinforcement in order that the time employed in council with the Indians can be used to fortify the storehouse which he wishes to make at the Miamis. He proposes to send from time to time an express to Niagara. He thinks that we can send troops during the whole winter by the South Coast. Good arms are wanting. He will do all he can to correspond with Mr. Stuart, but he thinks difﬁ~ culties will arise concerning the Post of the Miamis.
Page 301
GENERAL INTERESTS 301 He wishes to build there a redoubt to protect his Provisions and ammuni- tion, calculated on the number of Inhabitants. He hopes that Captain Lernoux will send him a Detachment to put it in security. _ He strongly recommends M. de Maisonville & hopes that when they shall be at the Illinois he will render to him a great service in the cause of his enterprising genius. He sends an express to (‘hicachaw to forward a message to Mr. Stuart. The pay of the Volunteers. although it appears large. is only half what they could earn it they staid in America. 4th October. He recommends M. Monforton as a good subject & sends me the letter which he has written to Caskaskias. 7th Octobers He continues his journal from the 1st October and sends the speech which the Rebels have delivered to the ()uabash Indians with four Coliers. - It is plain that Mr. Celoron is inconveniently frightened in leaving for the Miamis, the effect of the indulgence of these gentlemen is that they cannot be depended upon. Two men called Rainbault have gone with some goods of the Miamis to Post \‘incennes against the most express orders which were given them 8: the oath which they have taken. They say that M. Bellestre who has been among the Spaniards marching with 100 Rebels of the Illinois to Post Vincennes. _ The 6th. They have struck their tents before day, when 3 Hurons coming from. Sandusky brought very circumstancial Intelligence of the approach of the Rebels by different roads, that their advance guard consists of 800 men and that they had artillery intending to attack Detroit, and giving many particulars calculated to discourage the Indians. He said to the messengers that having promised the Ouabache Indians to assist them he wished to keep his word, to which the Indians consented with a good grace. I 7th. The reinforcement of 80 men of Niagara commanded by Capt. Bird arrived. Capt. Lernoux has given him 1 off. 2 serjts. and 30 men of the 8th-Regt. to accompany them.

The great lixpence and difﬁculty attending the Transport of _Provisions to the Upper Posts, make it much to be wished that effectual means could be fallen upon at them all for raising a supply within themselves that might relieve them from their inconvenience and sometimes distressful dependance upon what is sent them from below, and at the same time ease Government of part of the heavy charges to which it is now subject on this account. I am informed that the price of Fresh Provisions at Detroit is regulated chieﬂy by the Quan- tity of those of the King’s sent up. If this be the case, much having been for- warded this year, it may be presumed that the Price will fall, of which it would be right to avail yourself, and therefore to purchase such a quantity l'rom‘time to time as circumstances may require in order to spare the salt Pro- visions and reserve them for time of need. Besides these expedients I should be glad to know whether there are not Lands near the Fort where part of the Garrison might not be employed to cultivate grain 8: even raise cattle for the use of the Post. and in time by their own Labor raise their own subsistence. It is a consideration well worth your attention and that of the ofﬁcers com- 'manding the King’s troops there, being likely to produce great advantages as well to the settlement as to the Troops who should have a reasonable al- lowance made them for what they raised & I hope if the attempt shall appear

My Loni), Inclosed herewith your Lordship will receive some presentments of the Grand Jury at the Court held at Montreal in September last which I am induced to trouble your Lordship with at this time as some of the gentle- men, who were membcrs of it are now going home Copies of these papers have been transmitted to Lieutenant Governor Hamil- ton to which there is no possibility now of obtaining any answer before the next year; This Gentleman may have been irregular in some of the proceed- ings alluded to in these presentments but I am well convinced he acted with the best intentions for the King‘s Service 8: the security of that part of the Provence committed to his immediate charge. When the communication from this lower Part of the Provence to the Upper Parts was entirel y cut off. Lieutenant Governor Hamilton's situation must have been particularly difﬁ- cult surrounded by numerous Tribes of Indians, doubtful, and perhaps with too much reason of the disposition of the Inhabitants of the settlement it might be necessary for him to assure an authority, and exert Powers not so proper for more settled or peaceable times: The security of that settlement was undoubtedly to be the. ﬁrst object of his attention I have the honor to be with great respect My Lord Your Lordship‘s &c (signed) FIREDCK.

RELATIVE TO A MISSIONARY ‘ FROM MR. OlllLLA'l‘, MERCHANT .\T MONTREAL UNADDRESSED SIR. I have the honor to inform your Highness that the Merchants of Michilimackinac & those'of this place who usually carry on trade have made some just observations on the indispensible necessity of having a Missionary in this place. they applied to the Honorable Major De l’eyster, Commandant, to obtain his approval & recommendation to the Governor General of this ' Province; thereupon he has sent them his subjoined answer of the 23rd of July last, & they have sent the subjoined letter to His Excellency Sir Guy Carleton. whom he thought then Governor. & which has not (as is said) any other object as Your Excellency can see; and the same day made the petition also snbjoined. for the said ('ieneral, signed by a great number of the Mer- chants; and the 25th July last made the inclosed subscription intending to support the said Missionary, whom I am charged to ask you for them 8: I hope that your Excellency will have the goodness to give them their demand for the reasons given in the said request and I shall have in my private capacity Sir, an inﬁnite obligation to be interested in the said Michilimakinac.

310 MOVEMENTS OF THE ENEMY which I take the liberty of laying before your Excellency, &c. The 3rd of february. Simon Girtie Interpreter who was employed by Lieut Governor Hamilton to watch the enemies motions near Fort Pitt arrived with strings from the six nations, Delawares, Chawanese and Wyandots 8: informed him that 2500 men commanded by a General McIntosh advanced from Fort Pitt late last fall as far as Tuscarawa,three days march from {\‘t Dusky with six pieces of cannon, the largest only a six pounder. that they have built a stock- aded Fort there, after which the main body retired back to Beaver Creek leav- ing 250 men in that Fort under a Colonel Gibson—Beaver Creek is 28 miles from Fort Pitt where they have a strong fort 8: a Depot of Provisions. That he was informed the main body was to move toward Detroit the latter end of March & that when he left St Dusky part of the six nations Dela- wares Shawanese &c. to the number of 7 or 800 men were assembled at the upper town. determined to strike the fort at Tuscarawa 8.: drive of or destroy the cattle & if any of the main army attempted to go to their assistance they were resolved to attack them in the night 8; to distress them as much as pos- sible. . Capt. Lernoult writes that he has done everything in his power to encourage them, has sent them a large supply of ammunitions 8: cloathing also presents to the chiefs warriors. The Indians are displeased of the Governors attend» ing to so distant a part when so large body of the enemy threatened their Lands so near hand. and have also he says given him a salladc for not send- ing his Warriors to their assistance, according to their Father's promises, now the enemy approach them. They- also assure him they were told by two Delawares lately come from Niagara that neither the commanding ofﬁcer or C0]. Butler were informed of their situation or they were certain some troops or “'hite people would have been sent to their assistance, in short they were so pressing & Capt. Bird so anxious to go with some few volunteers to erve with the Indians that he was forced to comply with their request notwith- standing the weak Garrison under his command, he also sent some ammuni- tion &c. along with him to pave his reception 8: to keep the Indians in the disposition they are in to oppose 8:, harrass the Virginians. Several Ottawas & Chippawas are setting otf for St. Dusky & many more he thinks .will follow when they arrive from their hunting. ' The Indians in those parts he says are greatly in awe of the six nations, therefore hopes a belt from them to spur them on to act with spirit may be sent him. He wishes much for the Governor or Mr. Hays return having no one to ad- vice with him in this critical time when it requires great caution and. attention to keep the Indians in good humour, 8'. preserve their friendships, when

INTELLIGENCE—PROVISIONS. 311 every artiﬁce is made use of by the enemy to draw them away. February the 16th William Tucker whom he sent out early in January last to reconoitre with ﬁve Chippawas—is returned this day and bring intelligence which cor- responds with Girtie 8: further that some few Wyandots & Mingoes surprised three Virginians going Express from Tuscarawas towards Fort Pitt killed two of them 8: brought the third a prisoner to St Dusky with a Pacquet of Let- ters that the chief there opened the Letters 8; had them read to him by a white man. That it appears by a Letter of (‘01. Gibson Commandant at Tuscarawa to a Capt. O‘Hara at Fort Pitt, that he was apprised of the Indians design to at- tack that Fo'rt, requested Provisions be sent him 8: a. part of the army with- out delay having little provisions 8: only 190 men ﬁt for duty in the Place. This Capt. Lernoult says is a lucky hitt, which the Indians will (he makes no doubt) take advantage otf. Capt Lernoult acquaints me that Detroit is capable in peaceable times to supply the Garrison with Provisions, but at this time the inhabitants are so much employed in Conveys 8: probably will continue so that they have not been able to thresh last years corn, & the great number of cattle furnished for Governor Hamiltons Expedition as well as for Detroit with what have been consumed by Indians have reduced the numbers so much that a pair of oxen cannot be purchased for less than 1000 Livres 8: then reckoned a cheap bargain, in order to save the salt provisions, he has fed the Garrison & In- dians with fresh during the winter, but the scarcity & extravagant rate they are now at besides the poorness of the cattle at this season obliges him to deliver salt provisions. ' Flour is 60 Livre a hundred '8: every article very dear. I have now only to acquaint your Excellency that some time before I received this Letter a large Belt with a Speech was sent by the six nations to their Western Bretheren en- couraging them to ﬁght to the last man & to drive the enemy out of the country.

32s ' CAPTURE OF POST VINCENT FROM CAPTAIN LERNOULT nxanonnssso NIAGARA April 2nd 1779 S'm, I have received an Express from Capt Lernoult by the felicity a copy of his Letter I beg leave to lay before your. Excellency DETROIT March 26th 1779. Sm, I had just received cOpies of the several Letters taken by the Indians near Fort Laurance, & the extracts of Governor Hamilton’s & Mr Hay’s Letter when one Isidore Chaina '(an Interpreter) & two Hurons arrived from Post Vincent with the unfortunate news of that place having been retaken by a Colonel Clarke the Governor & whole Crimson made prisoners, except himself who made his escape with difﬁculty. This most unlucky shake with the approach of so large body of Virginians advancing towards St Duskie has greatly damped the spirit of the Indians. The Chiefs from St Duskie are come in here with John Montoine to claim Governor Hamilton promises to assist them. They declare If a large detach- , ment of with cannon are not sent without delay from below they must go out of the way, being not able to ﬁght the enemy alone. As the loss of this Post opens a new road for the Virginians to this place by the Miamis River, I hope a strong reinforcement will be sent here from Niagara by return of the vessels at least what they can convey, as the New work is not yet defencible requiring many hands. The Canadians exceedingly assuming on '0111' had success & weakness not one of them will lend a hand, spades shovels, 8:0. are much wanted also ammunition as per inclosed return above 30,000 lbs of ﬂower of_ last years allowance not as yet sent here, with other species in pro- portion, the enormous quantity consumed in the last unfortunate expedition has reduced'us greatly pray forward it, for the Indians insist on having pr0~ visions sent to them or they must starve.

I beg leave to repeat to you the necessity of a reinforcement being sent as the consequences may be fatal.

AFFAIRS IN THE WEST AND SOUTH 329 GENERAL HALDIMAXD TO LIEUT. GO“. HAMILTON QUEBEC, the 8th April 1779. Sm, I received your several Letters, previous to your departure from Détroit, the suddeness of your Resolution to march against the Rebels that had Invaded the Illinois, made it impossible for me to give you any orders; but, from my Knowledge of you 8: the Spirit your Letters breathe, I am per- suaded you have executed what appear’d to you best for the King’s Service. & in that Light the measure you had pursued was stated to the Secretary of State in my Letter of last Fall. I have since by your Dispatches of the 18th Decemr last which came to hand the 19th of March with their several Enclosures, learned that you have taken Possession of Fort Yincenncs, long before this reaches you, you will have been satisﬁed whether the Rebels seriously intended an attack upon Detroit, and acted in consequence, or seen what further could be done for the King's Service in those parts, with the force at present with you; my anxiety for the safety of' Niagara 8:. Detroit has induced me to send there Captain Brehm, my aid dc camp, who has my directions to consult Captain Lernoult, & forward you from thence upon an exact view of the state of things in those parts, his opinion upon the further measures most proper to be taken by you. o By accounts which hear every mark of authenticity, His Majesty’s Arms have been attended with success to the Southward, the Province of Georgia once more reduced to obey their lawfull Sovereign and great Hopes are enter- tained of the Royal Forces being able to penetrate further that way; it is likely this will engage the Southern Indians to make such a Diversion on their Part, as may tend in future to facilitate your operations. In the uncertainty of all things here, uninformed how far this War may spread, it is impossible for me at this distance to give you orders 8; directions respecting the further measures to be pursued by you; of the possibility 0r practicability of those you embrace, you must be the best judge and on your doing what is best for the King‘s Service, Imust & do fully rely. Before you undertake anything considerable I must recommend your weighing well the difficulty & expense that must attend the transport of every article you are to be furnished with from hence, & whether they are likely to be compensated by the advantages expected to arise from such an under- taking. When you write this way I should be glad to receive the best informa- tion you can procure in regard to the most likely measures to be pursued for (-onciliating the Indians, preventing the Rebels designs 8: securing the Upper 42

SIR, It is with. real satisfaction I have received from Lt. Col. Bolton an account of the active and proper dispositions you have been making to receive the Rebels. Whatever their designs may be, it is happy for the King’s Ser- vice, a Post of such importance as that of Detroit should be entrusted to so careful and diligent an ofﬁcer, I hope and doubt not, that you will continue to exert- your best Endeavours for the security and preservation of that settlement. \ Anxious to be informed as soon as practicable of the true state of things in the Upper Country I send Captain Brehm my Aid-de-camp as far as Detroit and it is my request, you would open yourself to Him with the utmost free- dom as to a Person, in whom you maylsafely conﬁde, upon all matters, which concern the Kings Service in those Parts. Captain Brehm is directed to give you my orders respecting your Post, which He is to deliver you in Writing, signed with His Own Hand, and to which you will in every Part thereof, exactly conform yourself. Capt. Brehm has received my directions to consult with you in regard to what may be done respecting the Post of Vincennes & the further steps advis- able for Lt. Govr. Hamilton to take, upon which he is to write to him from your Post; for at this distance 8: without Information of the actual state ,of things in the Upper Country it is impossible for me to point out to the Lt. Govr the Measure he ought to pursue. By this conveyance, I desire Lt. Col. Bolton to favour the Transport of goods, belonging to Mr. McComb of your settlement, as'I understand he is the Person employed by Lt Govr Hamilton to furnish 'the articles wanted for the Indians.

DESIGNS OF THE ENEMY—JOSEPH BRANT 331 LORD GEORGE GERMAIN T0 GENERAL HALDIMAND (EXTRACT) WHITEHALL 10th April 1779 Sir Henry Clinton has acquainted me that he has transmitted to you the information he has collected of their designs. Their building Battoes at Still Water indicates a design of entering by the Mohawk and perhaps attempting N'agara & Detroit, if they are able to force theirway to them; but I confess I am not apprehensive of their being able to effect any thing material on that side whilst the Six Nations continue faithful, and the judicious measures you have taken to succour them in case of an attack, and the supplies you will be enabled to send them, will, I hope, prevent their being frightened into a. neu- trality—The great importance of Niagara 8: Detroit and the navigation of the_ Lakes which depends upon them, must however, always render them objects of particular attention, and I was very happy to ﬁnd you had reinforced the garrison 8: given orders for strengthening their defenses, as well as for repair- ing the armed Vessels and augmenting their Crews. The astonishing activity. and success of Joseph Brant’s Enterprizes and the important consequences with which they have been attended, give him a claim to every mark of our regard- and which you think will be pleasing to him. What has occurred to me as most likely to gratify him, has been done, and enclosed herewith you will receive a commission signed by His Majesty ap- pointing him a Colonel of Indians and on Board the Three Brothers Store ship is a box with prints taken from Lord Warrick’s picture of him which he was particularly pleased with, some of which you will send into his nation, and dispose of the others as you think most honorable for him, as a memorial of his services. Major Butler and his son appear also to have done good service and you will acquaint him that their care to prevent the Indians from molesting the unarmed Inhabitants is much approved by the King. I ﬂatter myself Lieutenant Governor Hamilton has succeeded in his Expe- dition to the Illinois Country. The destruction of the settlements of the in- nocent inhabitants by the Rebel Banditti that professed themselves of that Country calls for the severest chastisment,_and the orders you gave to Mr. Hamilton and Col. Bolton on that occasion were very proper & you will see by the inclosed extract of my letter of the 2d Dec’r to Colonel Stuart that he has orders to support the Ouabash Indians in effecting the services you have directed them to be employed in; You will see by the enclosed extracts of my letters to Sir Henry Clinton that it is intended in the course of the summer to attack the sea costs of the

332 MILITARY PLANS revolted provinces wherever their posts or Inle‘ts are accessible to the King's land or sea forces. These operations will of course prevent them sending any considerable detachments of the Militia from the lower Parts of the Provinces to join those upon the back Frontiers in an‘Expedition to Canada, or even to strengthen Mr. Washington’s army. And as Sir Henry Clinton will after supplying these Expeditions have a large Force remaining with him with which to act in the Field as opportunities may offer, verry important results are expected to be brought about before the close of the Campaign. The Cooperation of Detachments of your Troops & parties of Indians on the Frontier must greatly contribute to the hoped for success. The attack in- tended upon the Province of Main must be particularly assisted by a detach- ment penetrating by the Chaudieré, and if a communication were opened with the Troops, which may be ordered to effect an Establishment on the Kennebec river, I should have little doubt of recovering to the King’s obedi- ence the whole of the Province. I am therefore to signify to you the King’s commands that you give par- ticular attention to this important object. The loss of your last Dispatches has deprived us of your Demands you pro- posed to send to the several Departments for supplies to be sent out this Spring.‘ That respecting the ordnance branch which is the only one received has been fully complied with, as you will ﬁnd by, the returns of what is shipped on Board the store ships that sail with this convoy, and we have done the best we could to furnish you with the other necessaries which were supposed to be wanting. A large assortment of goods, arms, and ammuni- tion for presents for the Indians ha been provided, and the inclosed Extract of my Letter to the Lords Commissioners of the Treasury will shew you what other articles were ordered to be sent out, 8: I have the satisfaction to 'ﬁnd that everything ordered has been shipped in proper time. The Cloathing 8: other necessaries sent for 2000 Provincials is meant to enable you to supply the Canadians corps you are authorized to raise as well as those already on foot. The Battalion of Col McLean’s regiment in Canada is not in- cluded in that estimate, for that regiment is included in the British Estab- lishment and is to be considered as a regular Corps—The Major of that Battalion has lately been appointed a Lieut: Colonel by Brevet, and as Colonel Maclean is now going out to Quebec he will be able to account to the ofﬁcers for the Major’s absence or order him to join the Battalion. Enclosed is the embarkation return of an additional company of Hanau chasseurs which are arrived at Portsmouth. The recruits for the Brunswick and Anhalt Zerbty Regiments are hourly expected 8: if they arrive in time will also. proceed with this Convoy. I could have wished to have sent you a.

I am. however, not without hopes your Force will be augmented by the return of the whole or at least a considerable part of the Troops of the Convention of Saratoga, Sir Henry Clinton having had orders to receive them in Exchange as Prisoners of War & upon their release to send them to Quebec. Your (Toinmission'of General in America was signed by the King on the 17th of last September. but in order to give you rank agreeable to your former commissions the date of it was carried back to the ﬁrst of January preceeding. Your agent to whom it was delivered put it on Board the W'arrick Man of War and it was brought back with my Dispatch; but I hope you will receive it safe by this conveyance. The Extract of my Letter of the 3rd of March to Sir Henry Clinton will inform you of the encouragement he is authorized to hold out to the Inhabit- ants of the Country they style Vermont, to induce them to return to their allegiance; your situation may enable you to have a more ready access to them; and it is the King’s pleasure that you should endeavor to open a. negociation with them upon the same ground & you will instruct your Agents to correspond with Sir Henry Clinton also and act in concert with such as he may employ in this Business. . I am Sir your most obedient humble Servant ' GEORGE GEBMAIN. General Haldimand. P. S. Intelligence from France mentions that there is an Intention to send some Troops, with some ships of War up the St. Lawrence this summer with a view to promote a rising among the Canadians and assist an Expedition meditated _by the Rebels; and I think proper to acquaint you of it that you may pay proper attention to the safety of Quebec tho’ I cannot say they will venture, in my opinion, to carry the project into Execution.

SIR, Soon after Mr. Livins‘s arrival in England he presented a memorial to the King. complaining of his having been removed from his ofﬁce & praying that Sir Guy Carleton might be required to assign the reasons for his removal, . and that they might be enquired into, and His Majesty was pleased to refer the matter to the Board of Trade for their consideration. Their Lordships after a full examination of the charges contained in Sir Guy Carleton’s correspondence, and the minutes of the Legislative Council, to which Sir Guy Carleton referred, reported their opinion to H. M. that there did not appear to the Board good & sufﬁcient reason for Displacing Mr. Livins—But H. M. desirous that a matter of so much importance to the welfare of the Province, as the removal or restoration of the Chief Justice, should undergo -the fullest examination before a ﬁnal decision was made, their Lordships report was by H. M., command laid before a Committee of the Privy Council for Plantation affairs, and Sir Guy Carleton had notice to attend the consideration of it if he thought. ﬁt. The report of the Lords of the Committee which recites the report of the Board of Trade at full length, and the conﬁrmation of it by the Privy Council is continued in the enclosed order of His Majesty in Council in the 29th of last month which I send to you by H. M. commands, and in obedience to which Mr. Livin has been ‘ restored to his ofﬁce as Chief Justice of Quebec, and I have signiﬁed to him

INSTRUCTIONS OF THE COUNCIL |335 His Majestys Pleasure—that he do immediately return to the exercise of his Functions & he Embarks in this Fleet accordingly. The Two additional Instructions which the Lords of the Council recom- mended to be sent to you, have been prepared and approved by H. M. & I Enclose them likewise herewith by H. M’rs command for Your Guidance and Direction. ' One of these Instructions will fully explain to you that it is H. M’rs Inten- tion that all the members of the Legislative Council are to be considered as equally Members of the Council of State, and the other, that every Instruc- tion respecting their conduct as a Legislative Council is to be communicated to the whole Body & entered in the Council Books, according to the Direc- tions given in your standing Instructions for it was certainly the Intention of Parliament & H. M’rs gracious purpose in constituting the Legislative Council, that they with the Governor should exercise every Power of Legisla- tion authorized by the act of Parliament for the further Regulation of the Government, & that the Inhabitants should by that means enjoy the advantages of making their wants known to a Body consistent to Relieve them, and if living under Laws suitable to their Local circumstances. The regular & impartial administration of Justice is an object that Deserves the most serious attention, and as I understand, there has not yet been any act passed for Establishing an easy method for the recovery of' small Debts, it is proper you should recommend a measure so necessary for the convenience of both Debtor 8: Creditor to the consideration of the Legislative Council. The appointment of Magistrates in the several Parishes or Districts for the preservation of good order & prevention of Injuries, by the speedy apprehen- sion of offenders, would be a very proper exercise of the Perogative you are Intrusted with,—But as their assembling at certain times 8: holding Courts of Sessions for the trial & Punishment of petty offenders may require the Interposition 0f the Legislative Council you would do well to make that also a subject of their consideration. Many other matters of Domestic arrangements will naturally suggest them- selves to you, or arise out of the Deliberations of the Council upon the state of the Province when they are assembled, which it may be proper to Digest into the Form of Acts, but as mistakes in Legislation are productive of much evil, and cannot be immediately remedied, I must recommend it to you to be extremely careful not to multiply'Laws without evident necessity, and to guard as much as possible against passing any upon misinformation, or mis- apprehension of the subject to which they apply. The Law Servants of the Crown are bound in duty to give you their best

336 \ GENERAL OBSERVATIONS advice and opinion in all such cases, and I have great pleasure in acquaint- ing you that Mr. Livins has given me the most solemn assurances that he will give you every assistance in his Power, 8: conduct himself in such a manner as a Member of the Council as‘will give you entire satisfaction of his Dispo- sition to render your administration easy 8: honorable to yourself & beneﬁcial to the Public. The Presentments of the Grand Jury at Montreal against Lieut. Govr Hamilton 8: Mr. Dejeau are expressive of a greater degree of Jealousy than the Transaction complained of in the then circumstances of the Province appeared to Warrant. Such stretches of authority are however only to be excused by unavoidable necessity and the Justness and ﬁtness of the occasion & you will therefore direct the Chief Justice to examine the Proofs produced of the Criminals Guilt,” and if he shall be of opinion that he merited the Punishment he met with, tho’ irregularly inﬂicted, It is 'the King’s Pleasure that you do order the Attorney General to grant a nole prosequi, 8: stop all further proceedings in the matter.

He said to them, that the welfare of their children interested him too much not to help them, having heard it said that they were in danger of loosing themselves. he added, that he hoped to ﬁnd them disposed to second the designs to which his fondness for them had prompted him, in short he pressed them. by all that could touch the heart of an Indian, to show themselves grateful. Determined also by the in- vitation of the Ottawas 8: Sauteux 8: also by the words of their father, after two days of deliberation, they declared that they would follow the example of their brothers. After having smoked with them their pipes of peace & re- ceived their belts they all agreed to be of one mind. Satisﬁed with their answer, their father said to them I do not doubt that you are my good children also I know that you are some of the new comers of whom it is said that they have good hearts. Having reported the extreme distress of the Americans 8: the prodigious progress of the Royal Arms in the Colonies 8: showed them the falsity of the pretended declaration of war between England & France for which design the Grand Couteaux (Big Knives) spread these false reports, he sent them back loaded with favors~& asked them to remember their words. Four days after—the Pontawatamies of the three villages assembled & held the following Council. Grand Council. held on the 6th of August by Mr. Bennet outside the in- trenchment. The Pontawatamies of the large village & of Terre Coupe 8: of the little Pilormeau being assembled, the following speech was made by a War .Chief named Le Petit Bled. My father, I do not come here with a mouth full of ﬂattery 8: deceit, I do not come into your presence to hide my sentiments, on the contrary I come to tell them to you, many which are in my heart my mouth cannot speak. I am surprised, my father, that you are come to disturb the peace which reigns in our lands. I am pleased however to see you with the pipe of peace which you offer us today instead of the tomahawk. It is him who troubled the peace which we joined, it is him who made the division among us It is him that we will make unhappy. It is he who is the subject of my surprise & of this speech. You vainly try, my father, to make us lift our heads from the pillow to listen to you. It is folly to present as with this load which is too heavy for - our hands, a mat would be better, & it is that you should offer us, but we will ask it of you. This belt (which I am only going to show) engages us to make this demand. It is 'from our French Father & represents his members & bones scattered
Page 350
350 INDIAN SPEECH here 8: there but which seem to-day gathered together 8: united against thee. Our Ancient Father, on giving it to us, said to us, “My Children, this belt is the knot which should bind and tie your hands, except for us, remember never to untie for your enemies, if they are conquerors, content yourselve with giving them the pipe of peace & living peaceably with them, until the day that we reappear on your Lands." "I carry again the pipe of peace in the mouth 8: I invite you to smoke it, it is ﬁlled with nothing that can be repugnant to your hearts, it is good to smoke it, &_ there is nothing bitter in it, on the contrary. it is sweet, very different from thy pipe of peace which my chiefs as well as myself have, to- day, rejected as a mortal plague.” i This Speach he addressed to the Ottawas S; Sauteause. I do not come to break the alliance/between us, my brothers, I only come to show you my way of thinking in the same way that I have showed it to my father. I confess to you that the red pipe presented to a party of my nation has been a poison to them as fatal as that of the venomous animal, this smoke has obscured the beautiful light 8: painted to us the shadow of death. It is in virtue of our union that they received your words and swallowed the poison. Their error has preceeded yours, deceived yourselves by the choice of a pipe, they have allowed themselves to be deceived. I repeat to you, my brothers, that this red pipe should never have been presented to us, but that ‘ which is instead of our alliance & which you have left among us byia mis- understanding (he here gave four branches of porcelaine) nevertheless I had notice to give it to you, in giving you this porcelaine it is not to over throw our lands. Take care at the same time of raising a mob. Keep a ready eye on those whom I have told you of. Cease to be fools, be prudent and wise. The speaker turned himself to his father, I have the same thing to say to ~ my father, change thy plans, renounce thy. projects which have been formed with neither prudence nor wisdom, if you are stubborn & despise my counsils you will perhaps repent, believe me my father and do not go farther. The speaker holding the branch of porcelain in his hand. Our lands peaceable until to-day refuse to carry men who would destroy the peace which has reigned so long, they also refuse to carry thy enemies, my father, 8: be persuaded that if my ears are deaf to thy voice they are also deaf to the Grand Couteaux (Big Knives) unless they say to me, “Keep quiet 8: be a spectator of our quarrel but do not mix in it.” If you have the same thing to say to me, my father, I am ready to listen. He gave the four branches of porcelain 8: ﬁnished the speech by telling to his father all that the Grand Couteax (Big Knives) -had said to him, he
Page 351
I ANSWER TO INDIANS 351 assured him that their desire to be peaceable was the only motive which had brought him to speak in this way 8: that it was not hate; he added that the esteem which he had for his father compelled him to show him his danger as 4he enemies were the most numerous, he being (by comparison) but one mouthful for them. Then he ﬁnished by saying to him that Governor Hamilton had given him a pipe of peace, which he still keeps, however he broke it in his engagement to take the tomahawk, that His Excellency had made him many promises which have not been executed, still he hopes that his father will accomplish them. Mr. Bennet’s answer to the Poutawatamies— Your father at Michilimackinac having heard it said that his children the Pous [Pottawattomies] were in great fear of the Grand Conteaux (Big Knives) he is eager to send you help, accepted by some of your chiefs but which you refuse to-day. Go, this good father has said to me, go, throw off fear my children by offering them your arms & those of all who accompany you‘. I ﬂatter myself, if they second your plans that they will recover their security 8: peace by destroying the principle of their terror. I am here, my children, charged with this ofﬁce. I appear on your Lands Tomahawk in hand & this club, made for some men but which you see with less horror, do not offer your regards to-day because they will serve as a reproach to the perﬁdy of your chiefs, 8: the truth broken by their false words. They were intended for your hands, but I dispense with you, my children, because you ask me to give into your hands, an arm which cannot be taken except by a warrior’s hand. However I know your good will has revealed your sentiments, for I have neither pretence nor imposture. " I also come to declare mine to you with the same liberty with which you declared yours, before I was obliged in the capacity of your father to pre- scribe your duty to you by two comparisons, so that you cannot lay on me the blame of your unhappiness which is only according to your ingratitude. I cannot see you made to tremble by the threats (for instance of the Grand Couteaux) nor your minds beguiled by the falsehoods prepared as they have been. what I have said to your chiefs is the pure truth. I cannot convince you more by a long argument, of your obligation to be faithful subjects. I will not show you the perﬁdious designs which the Grand Couteaux (Big Knives) formed on the conduct which they would have made you keep, as what I have come to say includes all. I ask you Poutawatamies which of the two fathers do you prefer? The one who attentive to your _wants has laid a heavy hand on you, is watching your

352 FURTHER CONFERENCE safety & taking care of your days or he from whom you have received no favors, who does not even know you except by the evils which he is watching to make you feel. \ And you Chiefs & Nations what would be your amazement if the youths of your village carried away by a fanatical ardor, scorned your councils, hunted you from your lands, what part would you take? Go, my children, go and ponder in drinking these drops of sweet milk, which I will willingly give you, what you will say to your father, above all, remember do not change your resolution neglect your ﬁelds but gather together with care & thrift every grain of wheat as for us we are resolved to go where duty honor and glory calls us. This little mouth can perhaps choke those who dare to bite. Two days had already passed without discovering what effect was produced on their minds by this answer when it was discovered that respect 8: clemency are not always the most proper means to bring them back to their duty, indeed the chiefs of the ﬁrst village followed by their young men convinced by the last words of their father, came near him to seek preservation 'from the evils which he had predicted for them. I am ashamed, in thy presence my father, said the ﬁrst chief of the village, after having been a member of a council which one of my nation has held for the misery of the others. I have however forgotten what I had resolved to say to you but I still declare that none of us have gone there nor taken part. I still assure you that instead of entering into their sentiments I am resolved, on the contrary, to execute punctually the words which I have given you in presence of all my people. I can not easily persuade myself to answer their father, that you he digni- ﬁed by taking the name of my children for without your words of assurance, received in your general assembly I should not have known of your eagerness to second my intentions. And thou Chiefs! if as I value to-day, your design in regard to me as your father 8: in this capacity you will conform to my will, why have you not risen up against the perﬁdy which offended me & declared in my presence that you have not participated in this perﬁdy‘.’ This was excused because of the coarseness or rather ferocity of his nature. Their father continued in these terms. I I have a good heart my children, it is open to every one who' will take a place there, but your conduct-towards me has rendered access diﬂicult, you can now only come by two paths I will show them to you, & if you banish them from you, you will not ﬁnd them again. You only deserve the name of children, when you regard me as your good father, but your brothers are

RESULT OF COUNCIL 353 unworthy to participate in the favors of him who is at Michilimackinac. I counsil you to go to him & tell him your wants, he will help you, he will provide for the needs of as many as remain faithful 8: grateful to him. I still consider that a part of you should accompany me on the road to Detroit if I undertake it, there are only two courses which you can take 8: these I propose to you. Having consulted among themselves as to the party they would take, such was the result of their deliberation. You cannot doubt our ﬁdelity, the War Chief has let you know satisfac- torily by his song thy good will 8: ours, we pray you to observe that not being accustomed to go on the lake & not having the necessary carriages it is impossible for us to follow your advice, as for the latter we can easily execute it. These difﬁculties are nothing my children, you will have all that is neces- sary for this road, it is absolutely necessary for your interests that you take it. I can do nothing, your father at Detroit cannot relieve your wants, he who is at Michilimackinac is the only one who can concern himself with you. Finally if I had not feared to show myself to you, do you fear what I will do to you? These last words lifted the obstacles which appeared insurmountable to them & determined them to follow the advice of their father. Some Miamis of a village called Coeur de Cerf (Heart of a Stag) present at this last council appeared also to have the same sentiments. Endorsed :-—Indian Council St Duskey. _ [B 122 p 391].

Germain My Loan, The situation of His Majesty’s atfairs in the Upper Country re- quires that I should represent it to you, and it is with much concern, I must observe to Your Lordship that notwithstanding the amazing sums that have been expended. the unremitting united endeavours of the ofﬁcers who com- mand at the Posts. with those who have had the Direction of Indian affairs, it is much to be apprehended that our Indian allies have it in contemplation to desert us, those of the \Vestern Nations in the neighborhOod of Detroit particularly, their former attachment to the French. the Pains that have been taken 'by their Emissaries to reclaim them. together with the unfortunate miscarriage of Lieut Gov‘r Hamilton have strongly served to alienate their affections, 8: although they continue to profess their attachment to the King, they frame excuses for not going to War. 8: discover upon all occasions an in- difference which indicates their intentions to forsake us. It is not so with the Six Nations. the ()nidas 8: a great part of the Tuscaro- ras excepted. who from the beginning have strongly espoused the Interests of the Rebels, their attachment is as ﬁxed as ever. but the regular advances made by the Rebels into their country in force. & the impossibility of their resisting them unassisted has alarmed their fears. but not shakcn their fidelity. I
Page 360
360 ATTITUDE OF INDIANS The inclosed copies of Letters 8: Indian Speech will give Your Lordship a perfect idea of their situation. .Their conduct the moment they declared for Government has been spirited & uniformly good. they have long requested assistance & it has been faithfully promised these three years past, but a want of Provisions, the difﬁculty of Transporting them to such a Distance, & the prodigious consumption owing, not only, to the necessity of feeding the In- dians while collected, but supporting Entirely all Women 8: Children of the Mohawk, Cayaya, and many of the Onondaga nations, whose villages have been destroyed by the Rebels, 8: who have taken refuge at Niagara, has ren- dered it totally impossible for me to afford them any. although so much the object of my wishes. From the inclosed letters I have not a doubt that unless a well timed assistance may prevent it, they will be forced into a neutrality, which with Indians is little better than a Declaration of War against the weakest Party, thus situated I have been obliged at all risks to order a De- ‘ tachment from this Province to their assistance of about 400 of the best and most active Troops, besides a large body of the Seven Nation Indians of Canada & some Mohawks who have resided here since their Country was de» stroyed (under the Command of Sir J. Johnson whose natural inﬂuence with the Six Nation, joined to the zeal & strong attachment he has upon all occasions manifested for His Majesty’s service will I trust produce an happy eﬂr'ect. Detroit is likewise menaced by the Virginians, they have made great ad- vances 8: have established Posts of communication in that Country. From every information that has been received it would appear that an expedition against Detroit is certainly intended under the command of 9. Col. Clarke, who retook Post Vincennes. I have reinforced Detroit & the forwardness of a most useful work now erecting there will I hope ensure the safety of that Place. unless the Rebels should ﬁnd means to make their way to it in great Force, which the growing slackness of the Western Nations may perhaps en~ able them to Effect. Retaining the Indians in our Interests has been attended with a very heavy expense to Government but their attachment, has, alone, hitherto preserved the Upper Country, 8: the Devastation they have made upon the Susquehanna and Mohawk Rivers has distressed the Enemy prodigiously, their settlements in those parts have been entirely broken up, their stock of every kind de- stroyed 8: the Inhabitants driven for subsistence into the interior parts of the Country. ' Major Butler's Rangers and the Indians have been constantly employed since the beginning of the Campaign, 'and have effected many good strokes Scouts from this Province towards the Enemy’s Frontiers have likewise been continually employed & have rendered essential service.

TREATMENT OF PRI SONERS—DEFECTION 361 Since I received the enclosed letters from the Indian Country, I had an opportunity of writing to Sir H. Clinton.

By the same opportunity I have received accounts from Detroit concerning the slackness of the Indians, and the Defection of many of the Inhabitants in the quarter—I enclose to your Lordship a Declaration of Count D’Estaing which was sent me from Detroit. copies of which are distributed all through the Illinois & Miamis Country, & which have had a very bad effect amongst French Indians there.

I beg leave to represent to Your Lordships that if it is intended to preserve the Upper Country 8: Fur Trade 1000 or 1500 men with a necessary supply of Provisions distinctly for that Service alone. must be employed as early in 46
Page 362
362 PRESERVATION OF POSTS AND TRADE the Spring as the River becomes navigable—half the number some time ago might have been suﬁicient. The Barracks at Oswego were, until last Autumn left standing, the remains of the Works were likewise in such a state. as to be rendered in a little time very Defensible. The Rebels have now destroyed the whole 8: every thing must be begun. The present state of Provisions in the Province 8: my pressing letters upon that subject, will point out to your ' Lordship, the impossibility of undertaking any operation of the kind, altho the salvation of the Province were to depend upon it (which I think in a great measure does) without very early supplies from Home, both of Troops and Provisions. I have many years regretted that measures were not adopted such as to prevent the safety of those Posts depending upon supplies from Home, so very distant, the Transport so extremely precarious 8: attended with so heavy an expense to Government, all which might be obviated, The Troops inﬁ» niter better provided 8: the Different Posts be in perfect Security, by raising Grain & all kinds of Stock at Detroit, which from its critical situation could very well supply both Detroit and Michilimackinac. The same Plan is] very practicable at Niagara and there is nothing wanting but a beginning, it will necessarily be attended with some expense, the ﬁrst two or three years, but would even in as many more amply repay it. In these times nothing can be vigorously undertaken, but should this unfortu- nate War speedily terminate. it should immediately be carried into execution & in such case I should be. happy to receive Your Lordships approbation of,~ and commands to undertake what I am convinced would produce the most salutary effects for His Majesty’s Interests in those Parts. _ I have information. which I have reason to think authentic, that the Rebel Fleet consisting of several ships from 20 to 30 Guns and many smaller (which has blocked up General McLean at Penobsiot, sailed from Boston for the purpose of cruizing in the Gulf and mouth of this River & intercept our Victuallers—Should they succeed in this attempt we shall experience the greatest distress for Provisions before the Spring Fleet can possibly arrive. The probability of these misfortunes happening, independent of what Trade suffers every year by the very defenseless state of the River, urge me to repeat my wishes to Your Lordship that some means may be fallen upon to prevent them, either by sending out the Newfoundland Fleet early enough to cruise in the above stations to protect the Ships in the Spring, and to remain for the return of the Fall Fleet. or such others as Your Lordship shall think most expedient to effect this important end. I have the honor to be &c. &c. (signed) FRED. HALDIMAND- [B 54 p 185]

I hope my Misfortune will be my Apology for troubling you, with a few particulars relative to myself‘and as your Ears have, been often open to the (‘omplaints of unfortunate Captives like myself you will attend to my particular case as there is something in it out of the common path of Indian Captives in which light I do not consider myself tho’ I am detained by them, the particulars of which I will endeavor to relate as brief as possible. On the 27th of last month, I set bit from the Falls of Ohio on board of a Batteau with an Intention of going to Fort I’itt the Crew consisting of nine persons who were passengers worked their Passage 8: found their own Pro- visions & seven of the prisoners that were taken last winter at Post St. Vin- cents with Governor Hamilton a negro \‘l'ench & myself in company of two other Boats in the Service of the State of Virginia under the direction of MrQ David Rogers who had sundry clothing 8: other things on board which they brought from the Mississippi 8: on the 5th Inst. about three miles below the little Miami River we fell in with a party of Senecas, Wiandotts,'Delawares 8: Shawneys at the crossing place of the Ohio Mr. Rogers with a party of men from the Boats attacked the Indians who were superior in number to the party he had with him he was obliged to retreat 8: two of the Boats fell into the hands of the Indians‘ but previous to the Indians taking possession of my boat I surrendered her and myself with two others & the Negro Wench to Serg’t Samuel Chapman 8: 'the others choosing to be a prisoner to British Troops rather than trust to a savage enemy, this surrender would have. been of little service to me if it had not been for the humane interposition of the White men who were with the Indians who have heretofore saved my Life tho’ it was often in danger but since my arrival here I understand the Indians mean to detain me some time longer tho" I am &_wish to be consider’d as a prisoner to British Troops I hope for your interposition to have me delivered up at Detroit as soon as possible that my sufferings in Captivity may be among a people of the same Language. Religion & manners 8: whom till within these few years, I looked upon in a ditferent light from that of Enemys. In the Compas of a letter it is impossible for me to relate minutely every particular relative to this aﬂ’air.

I am sorry to say that the Indians are obliged to stand too much on their guard against the Virgin- ians 8: Indians in their interest, to make it possible to get them to attempt anything whilst thus threatened, more than to endeavour to prevent the fur- ther incursions of the enemy into their country. I have received accounts from different bands of Indians, that the Rebels are with the consent of the (I‘ashote Indians building a Fort at their Village, 8: I wait in daily expecta— tion for Letters to conﬁrm or contradict this report. On my arrival here I found the Wabash Indians quite inactive, I therefore sent Belts & speeches to them to point out the necessity of their not suffering Clark to erect a strong Fort 8: Village at the falls of the Ohio, or at twelve miles down the river as he observes. If I should succeed in bringing those Indians to act against Clark, it will take off his attention from the Illinois Country whilst Lt Governor Sinclair- directs the Indians who have promised to strike at the Illinois in the Spring, to cross the Missippi. as if going to war against the Osages of the Missourie 8: thereby surprize Fort Louis at I’incour. I shall send off an Express by Land to Mr. Sinclair offering my opinion on the subject. . Your Excelly‘s Commission appointing Mr. Thomas Williams a Justice of , the Peace, is come to my hands, but as the Dedimns is particularly directed to Capt.

INDIAN AFFAIRS 377 GENERAL IIALDIMAND 'ro MAJOR or: PEYSTER QUEBEC, February 12th, 1780. SIR, I have received your Letters of the 1st Octr. 1st 8: 20th Novr. and have honored your last bill from Michilimackinac. The Expenses attending the Indian Department at that Post this last year have been enormous—I shall be glad to be more fully informed what they have been doing to & on what particular services and account they have been incurred. I hope you have cautioned Governor Sinclair to moderate as much as possible the Expense of that Department. Your account of the success of the Scout upon the Ohio together with the Papers that were taken have been forwarded to me by Colonel Bolton. I hope that stroke will have a good effect with those Indians whose affections seem declining—much depends upon their steadiness at this interesting period, and I am persuaded nothing in your Power to preserve their attach- ment will be wanting. I very much approve your Plan of employing the Wabash Indians, 8: hope they will succeed in preventing Mr. Clark from establishing himself at or near the Falls of the Ohio, otherwise the Indian country will be open to their continual Incursions 8: safe communication will be formed between Fort Pitt 8: the Mississippi, if Lieut. Governor Sinclair should not be quite so success- _ ful as is wished, his striking at the Illinois will be well timed. 8: if not too late may (in some measure) favor the proposed operations towards that Quarter. .

I think it necessary to send this Express by Land, to acquaint your Excellency with my having received a Letter, from Mons Louis (Jhevallier of St Joseph’s (brought by his son Aim-able) acquainting me with the Rebels having totally evacuated the Illinois country. Thirty Indians also arrived _ from the Omat. and P0st Vincent. in consequence of my Invitation, they are now on their way back, having promised that the Rebels shall not recross the \Vabash. ' Lieut Caldwell of the King‘s Regt (,‘apt McKee, Mr Elliot, the three '(lirtys, & about ﬁfty Indians. consisting of the principal chiefs of the Mingoes, Shawnese & Delawares are also arrived. who reports that the Rebels failed in their attempt to establish a Fort at (,‘ooshocking. but that they had quite surrounded the Indian Hunting ground of Kintuck, by having built small Forts at two days journey from each other as will appear by the Indian Map of that country. The Indians further say that the rebels intend to cross the ohio in the spring, & build a fort at two days journey from their principal Village on the Little Miami. They therefore require of their Father to fulﬁll the promise
Page 379
DEMANDS OF THE INDIANS 379 made by former (fommandants who assured them that when the Enemy should approach their Villages. Troops should be sent to their assistance, they produced Lt. Governor 'Hamilton‘s Belt and other strings to this effect, as a proof of their assertion. saying that it was now time to fulﬁll the prom- ise, or they would be shortly under the disagreeable necessity of falling back and thereby become a burden to their father. or else quit their ground 8: go to the Southward. The principal Chiefs of the Hurons, Pottawatamies. (.‘hippawas, ()ttawas. Ouiattons, Miamis, ()uiats and the Pirorias. with the Keekapoos. being present in Council declared, that if I would send a few Soldiers, ’till a larger body could be spared, they would all rise & assist their elder brothers. and act in conjunction in future for the good of the King’s Service. I see the neces- sity of sending some soldiers S: ] therefore propose to send one (.‘apt. one Lieut. 8: about ﬁfty men with two small pieces of ordnance to help them to , knock down the Pickets of the ﬁrst Fort. To this party I shall add all the Indian ofﬁcers and as many volunteers as may otfer from the SettlementQ-this may for a while keep up the spirits of the Indians, ’till your Excellent-y's pleasure is further known. Their route shall be up the (ilise and down the Great Miamis to the Ohio. I ﬂatter myself that this early movement, if accompanied by the great num- ber of savages I expect, will facilitate Lt. Gov'r Sinclair‘s partys in their en- terprises down the Mississippi. divert the attention of many from Niagara 8: be of some use to B. Gen. Campbell. if he has not already taken New Orleans. The “'abash Indians & some from Michilimakinac have promised to amuse Mr. Clark at the falls. I wait ’till the mouth of the Miami is clear from ice to send of this Party.

He has now been two 8; twenty years in the service, and had lately the offer of one of the Provl Battallions to be raised by Lord Dunmore in, the neighborhood of Pitsburg, but the Commissions & Instructions were inter- cepted by the Rebels. He observes that should he be so unfortunate as to be taken by the Enemy, he has no rank to protect him from Insult. ' Mr McKee appears to be a sensible man, 8.: much of the Gentleman, his inﬂuence with the Shawnese nation is beyond conception. They solely conﬁde in him.

[B 122 1) 4723] FROM MR. cnnvanunn L'XADDRESSED I do not know by what prodigy, Sir, the Poutawatamies have suddenly come out from a h‘loth or rather a lethargy, that three years of want have not been able to cure. they have risen ashamed of a sleep which the voice of their Father and mine could not awaken them from; they have resolved to open their ears to this voice. Scarcely have they heard your words, calling to remembrance all those which they have received and given. than they have taken immediately the tomahawk. First holding themselves on the' defen- sive but having learned from some chiefs, come from Detroit that the Five Nations invited them to the War, they set out the 12th of May to the num- ber of 24. I believe now there' are ﬁfty or sixty for they are coming from all sides to swell the party. I am doing myself the pleasure of equipping them 8: of giving them proper instructions for the good of the Service. The Party is not composed only of those who have always given hopes but

DISPOSITION OF THE POTTAWATAMIES 381 a of those on whom they cannot rely. At the same time I am giving ammuni- tion to the other party composed of Indians of Terre Coupe. the most ob- stinate and false of all. The Petit Bled was at the Illinois last autumn, with all his young men. He was there to receive the presents which Linctot promised to him in writing, or to avenge himself for the bad faith it he is deceived. That is what he explained to his nation there-by hoping to ﬁnd favour with his true father. Whilst I am sealingyour letters this, that I add is just handed to me. I send it to you that you may persuade yourself that if the Rebels have all the Indians, as it appears, against them, it is improbable that they can penetrate to their land. I have given you a true picture of the disposition of the Poutawatamies, I desire that it should last as long as they have been in showing it. L. CHEVALLIER. ST. Jossrrr, 13th March 1780.

I exhort you to this if you will do me the pleas- ure. I am deprived of every thing even the necessities; they refuse here all passes for the Mississippy especially for carrying provisions; there has been published on the part of Kaos. an order which forbids the sending away of any money. They say that Irland is revolted; Jamaica taken by the Count D’Estaing; Admiral Biron well beaten by the same; New York blockaded by the same 8: by the Americans; the Prince of Monfacon in the River St. Law- rence for the seige of Quebec; the Natches, Mamchauks at Mobile 8: Pein- sacole have been taken by M.

390 RELATIVE TO REMOVAL OF FORT MICHILIMACKINAC ‘ TO'i‘ MAJoa m: PEYSTER wn‘noc'r SIGNATURE" QUEBEC the 16th April 1780. SIR, Having long thought it would be expedient to remove the Fort, &c, from its present situation to the Island of Michilimakinac, &Abeing encour- aged to this undertaking by advantages enumerated by Lt Governor Sinclair, that must result from it, & the earnest desire of the Traders, I have given directions that necessary Preparations, by collecting materials &c. be made with as much Expedition as the strength of that Post will admit of. You will therefore please to purchase four good draught mares (not too old to breed) 8: two Stallions 8; send them to Governor Sinclair by the ﬁrst oppor- tunity. I am persuaded it is unnecessary to recommend to you to furnish him every other assistance he may require & that Detroit can afford, in forwarding this work, further than by giving you my sanction for the same, which I do. in the fullest manner. I am, Sir your most obedient 8: most humble servant P. S. I wish you also to send 4 pair of strong cart wheels to Michilimaki- nac, eight setts 0f Harness for that Post, will be sent for you to forward by the very ﬁrst Vessels. ' _ MAJOR on PEYSTER.’i‘ endorsed Copy 1780, to Major de Peyster of April. [B 122 p 477] * [The accompanying cuts and descri tions were undoubtedly submitted to General Haldi- mand by Lieut. Gov. Sinclair some oonsi emble time previous to the date of the letter here 'ven. but as this is the ﬁrst reference found in the manuscripts to the removaliof F 011; Michillimac inac it seemed advisable to insert the drawings at this point.——Ed.] ' t The correspondence ublished in vol. IX shows this letter to be from Gen. Haldimand to Major De Peyster. Sine air claimed that De Peyster treated the above instructions with an- friendly neglect and many accrimonious letters were exchan ed. The letter from Sinclair to gerehﬁndremitting the following plans for a new fort may be ound on page 523, vol. IX.—Ed. c. ition.

It is not improbable that the Fort of Michilc. was placed in its present bad situation for the convenience of the Mission of St. Ignone, and the St. Hawas who were found the Earliest Prosylites of Christianity. A. Fort or work at * would protect a Vessel laid up at X in the Bay but must always leave the Enemy two natural approaches from under the Banks A & C & therefore would be better at C, if afforded equal protection to a vessel laid up opposite by Com- mandr. both banks towards C & D, but upon the whole an Engineer should be sent up, as it being impossi- ble to ﬁx the spot for a Fort by a sketch, as greatly depends upon distances & heights which are bet- ter discovered upon the very Spot. If a \ Block House could be sunk at the point * and another at the side of the Ridge C, so as to be covered by the same from one side and a Raised Rampart from the other, or even sunk into the very Ridge itself, thesame angular con- nected with one another so as to con- tain all the Trader’s Hutts, or House & the stores, it would afford a better Defence than the proposed two Half Bastions—as Block Houses are the only works which afford a self defence without eed of annother work to ﬂank them & at the same time may serve as Barracks or guard room. but nothing of all that can be done without being on the Spot for reasons above mentioned and none others- [B 97 1 p 243]

I am about to inform you of all that is l1appened_ to my knowledge, con- cerning the good of the service, which forms the subject of this letter. Although the facts contained in this, which is addressed to me from Post \"iiicennes,.of which I send you an extract. could have inﬂuence only over minds ill-disposed or destitute of good sense, yet they have had enough over the minds of the Indians, to relax the zeal, with which they appeared to have been ﬁlled, for the glory of their father. To conclude. Jamaica has been taken by the Count D’Estaing, he has left a garrison there of 8,000 men, but another expedition calling from else- where, his absence has occasioned a revolt on the part of the English. Having been informed of this he has returned to condemn the authors of the revolt to be hanged. . The Governor of New Orleans found some orders in an English frigate, armed with 800 men, taken by a Spanish vessel, to destroy Pointe Coupée, kill the French and hang the negroes. This refers to the war between England & Spain. Immediately the Governor of Spain sent an expedition to Manchauk, which has been taken by assault, with 500 men, after having sustained 900 shots from cannon. Baton Rouge & the Natchez have been

It is not, however, the chimerical rumors which has stopped the Pouta- watamies' in their route. A Frenchman met them on their road &, recognis- ing them as warriors going to war, he said to them. Have you become ene- mies of France 8; Spain? Do you not know that it is they who are making war just now? Return to your Villages or if any one doubts the truth, let him follow me 8: he shall see with his-own eyes. The War Chief held a council immediately, not to seize the French who spoke with so much impu- dcnce but to send them back. It is, however, agreed with me, that he was humiliated for he had be- lieved the false reports 8: the more so having to return without the author of it. As in such cases the Poutawatamies are divided, twenty warriors of ditfer- ent Villages detached themselves 8: are gone to follow the French, who offered to lead them to the head man who was a Chief named Iuoiqueperman, ' this is the same man who took the letter which I communicated to you. They went to Post Vincennes ashamed of allowing themselves to be deceived, being allowed to speak, the Chief invited by the Americans spoke ﬁrst 8: told him all that his feeling inspired him with, told him also that he was English, that he was to be regarded as such, that he had already come to kill him & that, if he had not been deceived, he would yet see his tomahawk dyed in his blood. The Americans, instead of being annoyed by the tone in which he spoke, compared him to a man making a crime of lying; he then assured him of the truth of the Declaration of war of France & Spain against England & dismissed him after he had given him a white ﬂag on which are laid two little pieces of blue cloth in the form of a knife. I have found it useless, said the chief to’ me, making a stroke, although the number of Rebels does not exceed 30. They are so much on their guard that he has not been able to surprise them. He has reported again to me that Petit Bled has taken 3 scalps &. a prison- er, one of the scalps is of a Frenchmen S; the 2 others of Americans, 8: that the prisoner is escaped. . This stroke is a good omen, a poutawatamie has struck this is 'enough, the others are leaving to strike also. I hope Qnamciose, followed by 24 warriors, will show his zeal; evidence of the return of the I'outawatimies & of his cause. he has not any regard either for the one or the other which makes me believe he will have success. This is in a few words what I have been informed of 8: I believe it my duty

I must therefore desire that with the assistance of the Indian ofﬁcers and such other Information 8: remarks as 3011 shall be able to obtain from the necessary Expenditure of the late years, that you will make out 8: transmit to me an Estimate of the different articles and Quantities of each that will be wanted at your Post, for twelve months. in order that you may be from time to time punctually supplied I hope at a more moderate Expense to Government. I do not expect your Calculations to be perfectly just, I know it is impos- sible it should, a the demands ﬂuctuate with the times, but it can be brought so near as to leave very little to be purchased from the Traders, you will in the mean time buy as few things from them as possible and calculate your wants allowing for the stock you may have in store.

They unfortunately listened to those extravagances, 8: returned to their homes except a few, who proceeded to satisfy their curiosity when to their ' great mortiﬁcation they found only 23 Virginians in the place—too late to recall their friends. Mons. De Quindre, who I had ordered with the St. Joseph’s Indianswould have prevented the imposition, had he not fallen ill on the way. Such is the dependance on Indians. without Troops to lead them on. The Delawares and Shawnese are however daily bringing in Scalps & Prisoners, having at present a great ﬁeld to act upon—those unhappy people being part of thelone thousand families who to shun'the oppression of Congress are on their way to possess the country of Kentuck, where if they are allowed quietly to settle, they will soon become formidable both to the Indians & to the Posts.

They were many private letters & grants for land. ‘ The Pottawatamies who returned from near Post Vincennes came here with all those of St. Joseph to have their Hatchet sharpened; they are now on their way to the Post where there are but thirty Virginians under the command of one Dalton; From thence they are to reconnoitre the rappids of the Ohio. The Canadians at Post Yincennes are the worst enemies we have. . There are now about 2,000 Warriors ﬁtted out from this place to recon- noitre the Ohio & “'abash.

To which I hope the following remarks will be satisfactory. Partly by reconciling the Chippewas of the bay de Noque with the Menom- enies, 8: the Chippewas of the plains with the Scioux, in order to make those nations useful in case of being wanted.

My design was to harrass Mr Clark on his way up the Wabash, and to put a body at St. Joseph’s sufﬁcient to oppose Linctot, with his cavalry from the Pey. Few of the Indians proceed further than St Joseph’s, but I am nevertheless persuaded that the noise of their assembling after Mr Hamilton’s defeat, so contrary to rebel expectations, did in a great measure oblige them to retire and, to lay aside their Expedition, especially as they were also informed that

Their arrival has caused much distress in the Village, but I ﬂatter myself, at/the same time, I can assure you that it is an evil for good. They are enraged they ask you by sixteen branches of Porcelaine, which I_ have charged La Fourche to hand you, to assist them, also the ()utogoy & Sottu. They wait with impatience for your answer. They will ﬁnd 300 warriors but this is not suﬂlcient to attack Post Yincennes & the Miamie. They request you to send them some ammunition 8; musquets.

Sm, I have received your Letters of the 16th 8: 17th of May and of the 1st ultimo by Mr. McComb 8: Mr. Perault, covering a Bill in favor of the former & intercepted Letters to Colonel Clark & Todd and reporting the measures you had taken to cheque the advances of the Rebels upon the Ohio, and to dispossess them of the Post at St. Vincennes. It gives me pleasure that you have viewed the dangerous encroachments of the numerous People said to have taken refuge from the oppressiou_of Con- gress in the Country of Kentuck' in so proper a Light 8: that you have pro- vided against the consequences. in which it is my desire that you vigorously persist, as well to prevent their becoming formidable in the Vicinity of our Posts as to secure to the Indians their natural right to that Country, con- ﬁrmed to them by Treaty, which Justice as well as Policy requires we should attend to. I hope the Indians will heartily take part in a measure so intimately con- nected with their Welfare, and that those who accompanied Captain Bird will act faithfully and with such Vigor as must effectually ensure his suc- cess—but it is distressing to reﬂect that notwithstanding the vast treasure lavished upon these People, no dependance can be had on them, and that the most triﬂing circumstantes. altho‘ ever so false or absurd will divert them from a Pursuit of the last Consequence, as in the Instance, mentioned in your Letter of the French man‘s report to those on their way to Post Vincennes, by which a good opportunity & much time has been lost. besides the Expence of a new Equipment to the War l’arty.

I hope those of that descrip- tion at Post Vincennes will be taken proper notice of. In regard to the Prisoners who multiply so fast with you, should you ﬁnd it necessary, a Part of them must be sent to this part of the Province. although we are equally at a loss to find room for them. The infamous Be- haviour of the Rebels to our Prisoners, in variety of Instances, particularly in the case of Lieut. Governor Hamilton & the Troops taken with him, who are still'conﬁned to a dungeon upon scanty 8: bad Provisions, and their obliging many (even in the character of Gentlemen) to work for their Main- tenance would sufﬁciently justify a Retaliation I wish to forbear, but if the number of your Prisoners become inconvenient, you will please to employ as many in the works as you can with safety trust abroad at a time—to work under a Guard if necessary, giving them a Ration of Provisions, and allowing them the same Pay as your Labourers have, which must be applied to cloathe them. The air and exercise will preserve their Health, and there is no doubt of their being treated with proper tenderness. Those who will not comply. you will please to send down in close conﬁnement. The list of Indian oﬂicers is at every Post so long & the expense so very great, that I rather wish to diminish than augument their numbers. But if Mr. du Quindre is so very useful a man, he must of course be employed and I should imagine as a Lieut. upon the usual Pay of a Dollar per Day. His services may hereafter entitle him to something more. I have accepted your Bill for the amazing sum of £61,035 Ss Sllld. The appearance of such drafts in so regular 8: so quick a succession, naturally laid me to reﬂect upon their fatal consequences to the nation. the Dif- ﬁculty (not at present thought of) that will be experienced in getting them passed at Home. I am far from attributing this Evil to indifference, or unhandsome conduct of the ofﬁcers under whom the Expence is incurred. yet I cannot help being persuaded, from Comparison. that a stricter & earlier attention to this essential circumstance, would have prevented Evils, which it is now very difﬁcult to repair—and long habit of Indulgence has created wants with the Indians, which otherwise they would never haVe eniperieuced, such as ﬁne Saddles & many Luxuries carefully exhibited to 52

410 ENORMITY OF' EXPENSES their view by the all grasping Trader. I think it would be cruel to deny these poor people who are employed .by us, such marks of our attention 8: regard as are necessary to their comfort—every shilling beyond that is super- ﬂuous to them & a loss to Government, nor is it in a Political view necessary. for however they may threaten to forsake us, we must know it is impossible they can exist without our aid, the Rebels not having necessaries sufﬁcient for their own wants, and consequently unable to supply theirs. I am like- wise satisﬁed that the expense has been greatly increased by permitting per- sons in Government Employ to become Traders. few of whom have virtue enough to consider the characters independently of each other. I must therefore desire your particular attention to the conduct of such as may be at present in that Predicament, which the Times make it necessary still to employ, and that in future, upon no account‘ whatever to suffer any Person under your command to be even concerned in Trade while in any appoint- ment 'of the Crown. I should likewise think it possible in a great meas- ure. to curtail the Indian Presents by representing to them the impossibility of gratifying their unnecessary demands, from the enormous expense attend-' ing it. That they shall be supplied with every article that comfort requires, but not with Superﬂuities. I am very sensible that the persecution which a commanding ofﬁcer at one of those Posts must go through from the Indians continually exciting by the avidity of the Trader, to demand, is very great—but as in those Situations, the most Essential part of their Duty is to attend to the Expenditure of the Public. Money, I am pursuaded it will be cheerfully borne. I have received your Letter accounting for the eXpenses at Michilimackinac.

416 INDIAN CONDUCT—COMPLAINTS GENERAL HALDIMAND TO MAJOR DE PEYSTER QUEBEC 10th August 1780 Sm, I have received your Letter of the 27th June covering‘an Estimate of Indian presents necessary for 12 months. The Indians have been accus- tomed to receive so very liberally. that now their Demands are quite unlim- ited. I have always thought the Presents too generally distributed, and am of opinion that Discrimination would not only diminish the expence, but materially forward the Service. You have now a good opportunity to make a trial of it, by distinguishing those Nations or Individuals who were most hearty in support of Captain Bird, and most attentive to the Execution of his measures and by retaining or lessening the presents of the others. It evidently appears that the Indians in general, wish to protract the War, and are most happy when most frequently ﬁtted out—it is impossible they can draw resources from the Rebels, and that absolutely depend upon us, for every Blanket they are covered with— I am far from wishing to curtail the advantages, these poor People ought to deserve from their Services, but to cloath 8: feed the Idle & undeserving, it is certainly if it can be avoided, im- proper. _ Their conduct with Captain Bird is highly reprehensible, they have inces- santly reproached the Commanding ohicer for not sending Troops to assist them in preventing the Incursion of the Rebels, and when with great Ex- pcnce and at a very inconvenient time, you ﬁtted out an Expedition for that purpose, they grew refractory, 8: instead of complying with & supporting the measures of their conduct. by which success must have been ensured, they abandoned him, followed their wild schemes, and by wantonly contrary to their Engagement, killing the-Cattle, rendered it impossible for him to pros- ecute the Intention of his taking the Field. Lieut. Governor Sinclair in one of his Letters says that “Major Gamble writes me from Detroit that many complaints are sent against me.” I fear there are Persons at Michilimackinac or its Dependencies who convey Reports from thence to Detroit prejudicial to him. 8: tending to create Jealousies 8: Discontents between the Commanding oﬂicers of these Posts—I am per- suaded that your zeal & wishes for the King‘s Service are equally strong, hav- ing both the same object, only in view. there can be nothing wanting but a perfect conﬁdence in each other. joined to the abilities you possess, to give success to every measure undertook in that Country; for I am persuaded you both think too liberally to suffer any little difference of opinion, (if “such there is) to lead you from that sense of duty; which distinguishes the perfect oﬂicer from the lukewarm croud. You would therefore do well at once to lay
Page 417
GENERAL INTERESTS - 417 open to Lieut. Governor Sinclair whatever reports of the kind may have reached you, whether by Letter or otherwise, with the name of those who have circulated them, and I shall desire him to do the same for your Infor- mation, by which means, these mean disturbers of Tranquility 8: of the Pub- lic Service, will be brought to light and discouraged. Altho’ I consider St. Joseph’s from its situation naturally more dependent on Michilimakinac, 8; of course more immediately under the direction of Lieut. Governor Sinclair, yet, as the Indians of that place sometimes resort to Detroit( 'and always expect an answer to what they may have to propose) you and Captain Sinclair should mutually inform each other of what passes & perfectly coincide in whatever is to be recommended to them to regulate their conduct-— Whatever has been hitherto the custom in regard to trading to Saguenant Bay, or other Places in the Vicinity, either from Michilimakinac or Detroit. . I would have punctually observed, subject at all Times to whatever changes the Exigencies of the Service may require. These matters cannot possibly be determined except by you & Capt. Sinclair, who. there cannot be a doubt I will cordially unite. in whatever measures are best calculated to promote the King’s Service. Messrs Finchley 8: Fisher are from their conduct & connections very unﬁt Persons to trust at a Distance, 8: where there is any possibility of holding any kind of Intercourse with the Colonists—I should therefore think it very unsafe to permit them to winter from Detroit, or in the summer to give them a Latitude of which they can take advantage—the former was dis- armed by Lieut. Governor Hamilton, much suspected by Major Lernoult 8: other ofﬁcers at Detroit & the other has always born a doubtful character independent of his connections.

418 - DISPOSAL OF MUNITIONS I recommend to your attention to paint to the Indians in the strongest terms the distressing and evil consequences of their perverse conduct in not supporting the measures planed for the effectual destruction of their Invaders 8: the difﬁculties they have thrown in the way of any future attempts for that purpose. I have wrote more fully to you upon this subject in a letter of this date. The Barrack Master at your Post having represented that the Straw neces- sary for Bedding for the Troops, is not only extravagently dear, but very difﬁcult to be procured? You will please to give orders that the Troops shall be supplied with that article by the Inhabitants, at the rate allowed by Gov- ernment, this they cannot think hard, as the Troops are not quartered upon them & kept there for no other purpose than to protect them. I am Sir &c (signed) FRED HALDIMAND. Major De Peyster. Endorsed: Copy, To Major De Peyster at Detroit 10th August. i [B 122 p 523] BOMBARDIER HOMAN TO CAPTAIN BIRD Hon’n Sm, Three days after the departure of Mr. Lorimer, I received Intelligence of the Rebels approaching to Cheteekothee, upon which I pur- pos’d to take the ﬁve horses belonging to Mr. Lorimer, and transport the Ordnance to the Ottawa Village and to conceal the loose Shot & Shells in the Wood—and in case of a close approach of the Enemy, before I could remove the ﬁx’d ammunition, to destroy it. We sought for the Horses 8: could ﬁnd but four—and when we came to harness them and were preparing to go: an Indian who resides here came & took two away in lieu as he said, of two that Mr. Lorimer had borrowed of him to‘come to Detroit, and also took a young horse that had not been used to work, as he pretended through friendship to Mr. Lorimer, least we should spoil hiin, so I was reduced to only one, with which 8: our assistance we drew the Gun a considerable way into the Wood, not near any Road and digged a hole & buried it so securely, that no one could even suspect of such a thing being concealed there. The smaller Ordnance, loose shot and shells &c we concealed in different parts of the Wood. I am afraid you’ll say I might have conquer’d the Indian, so perhaps we might have killed the whole, be having two or three more with him; but I could not tell what might be the consequences of beginning a War with the Indian—I beg pardon for running on thus, I ought to have left those remarks to your superior Judgment.
Page 419
ATROCITIES 419 The 13th Instant—'Silver heels (an Indian Chief) came here & informed us of the Rebels having evacuated the Indian Country, after having des- troyed Cheteekothee & the Pickawee Towns. They left it on the night of the 9th inst. Their sudden departure was owing to the desertion of the Frenchman you gave in charge of Delaware Jack to bring to Detroit, whom he took to the Pickawee Town and kept him at his house: He informed the Rebels of Mr. Lorimer’s taking the man from thence in order to bring to Detroit; they had supposed the man to be dead in the Bush. The Indians got this intelligence from a Rebel Prisoner they took, whom they afterwards burnt. They also killed all the male Prisoners that were able to desert andt give intelligence—it was at those two towns only that they killed the Prison-- ers. The Indians in the different skirmishes, had six men killed and one- man & one woman taken Prisoners. What losses the Rebels sustained is not known, but the prisoner informed them of two of the Colonels being killed, and Silver heels has forgot their names. Rogers the Prisoner was missing when the Chief came away; but they harbourctoo good opinion of him to think he is deserted. The Rebels killed the Woman by ripping up her Belly & otherwise mangling her—they also opened the graves of the Indians that had been buried several months, and scalp’d them. I have sent to Roche de bot for two Bags of Flour & two Cags of Pork, which is more than a month’s provision; but it will be an even load for the horses—I am not suifere'd to take more than two.

I 420 INDIAN SPEECH During Mr. McKee’s short stay here, I conversed with him upon the sub- ject of his expectations when he gave me to understand that Lord Dunmore had ordered two Battalions of Provincials to be raised in the Vicinity of Fort Pit. That the command of one was given to a Mr. Connolly who on his way to Fort Pit was taken Prisoner, and actually has his Pay & Bank at Philadel- phia where he still remains conﬁned. That a commission of Lt. Colonel of the other Battalion was made out & sent to him, Alexr McKee, which com- mission was taken on its way to Fort Pit. and destroy’d by which means he never received it, and ﬁnds himself thereby deprived of the rank intended for him, after having made some disbursements on account of said Battalion. I know of no way to serve Mr. McKee here unless a small provincial corps of loyalists were to be raised for the defence of the frontiers of Detroit. 1 have the honor to be with great respect Sir Your most bomb 8: obedt servt - A'r.

This belt we now present you with is that which we have spoke to you twice before upon; and as our words then made a proper impression upon your Heart; we are now induced to send it to you a third time. Father! Upon the ﬁrst certain Intelligence we received of the Virgin- ians design to strike our Village, we sent in a deserter from them, who we thought would have given you sufﬁcient information to have afforded us your timely assistance. The person he was charged with had also a string of wampum accompanied with a piece of tobacco to those,of your children who were round you to inform them of our danger and excite their support; as all the force we were able to collect was too small to withstand their num- ber; And now Father we have to inform you of the destruction of Four of our Villages by them, and though the loss we have met with of our Friends in the resistance we made against them is not considerable, yet our distress is no less, on account of our women and children who are left now destitute of shelter in the woods or Food to subsist upon. Our warriors have not now even Ammunition to hunt for, or defend them; And we have received cer-

The Rebels I hear have left the Shawanese country, after having destroyed the corn & burnt the Villages. The wretched Women and Children are beginning to come in for Provisions, as at Niagara. The Enemy I am told threaten a visit to the Wiandotts at Sandusky, some reports say that 1200 men are actually in march for that place. Captain Hare with the Rangers & Canadian Volunteers. tho’, little can be expected from the latter, are moving to oppose them with all the Indians Mr McKee can muster. At this instant, accounts from Capt. Mompesson, advise that 200 Pirognes with Creoles, are on their way to Michilimakinac to revenge the stroke lately made upon them. I however am inclined to think,‘ that no force from that country will attempt that Post at a season, when they have so strong a Militia and that their Expedition must be against the Indian country only. At any rate in the present situation of atfairs here, I cannot pretend to weaken this Garrison having so lately sent otf considerable detachments & having six & thirty_sick, with the “New Fort in the condition lately reported. I am not yet called upon, & it is hoped the news like much of the like nature may prove false, by the time it is conﬁrmed, the Rangers may be back, when I shall not hesitate to send of a Detachment to their assistance.

SINCLAIR 'There appears to me an improbability that the Indians bordering on the Mississippi can be entirely prevented from-visciting this Post annually, not- withstanding they are forbid to come. and were they disgusted by too severe treatment, or bad reception, after their arrival, the Traders in this country would suffer, particularly those, who have had merit in attaching them to ’Government and engaging their services when they were wanted—and if "Traders amongst them who can be depended upon, are totally restrained éfrom making any presents in their wintering grounds, a communication of Intelligence with the Post and between the Traders would be interrupted entirely, & there would be no means of employing an Indian until] he came ﬁrst to the Post and thereby the opportunity of his' service lost.

Germain My Loan, The 27th Ultimo, I had the Honor of writing to Your Lordships by a Brig bound to Guernsay, which was unfortunately cast away, the Crew were saved & my letters returned, which I suppress, having now the Honor, by a vessel going north, about to make a second attempt to acknowledge your Lordships dispatch by the Danae Frigate, containing a secret letter dated the 8th of April—Letters no 23—24 8: 25-— , Their several contents I shall have the Honor to answer more fully by the ﬁrst safe opportunity. Your, Lordship will have heard long before this can be received, that' the Trade Fleet was dispersed at Sea, and that many of the ships are taken, it is I fear but too certain that the “True Briton" is of the number. but this misfortune happened so early, I hope it was known in time enough to be in part repaired this season.

TRADE FLEET—GENERAL INTERESTS _ 431 There are but 14 ships of the Trade Feet arrived. and it is now too late to expect that any more of them will appear—The Rebel Papers are crowded with the Reports of their being carried in by their Privateers— I am however happy to acquaint your Lordship that “Ocean, Bridgewater, Argo & Hercules” Victuallers escaped, and that the “Nancy, Isabella, Weir, Sophia, Spring & Holmton” which sailed after, are safely arrived. the “Amphitrite” is lost in the Straits of Bellisle—The Convoy Frigates, with the “Hind” 8: Pro- vincial armed vessels are cruizing to protect the Gulf—They have sent up three Rebel Privateers & it is reported that the Newfoundland Fleet have sent six into St. John’s. For the better security of the Trade 8: Posts in the lower part of the Province, I purchased a ﬁne Vessel carrying 22 Guns, 6 & 9 pounders, which with two smaller Vessels well ﬁtted out, I put under the command of Cap- tain Young— I have lately had~the mortiﬁcation to hear that the former the “Woltf’ is cast away upon the Island of St Peter’s, owing entirely to a thick Fog 8: Tempestuous weather, The “Hind,” very narrOwly escaped the same fate, her Provisions, Guns 8: a great part of her rigging were saved. By His Majesty’s Sloop, "Swift." which sailed for New York on the 12th of July, with the return Transports, I had the honor of addressing Your Lordship to report the arrival of a reinforcement from the Southern Army, and that nothing of any moment had occurred in the course of the Winter, —I think it unnecessary to send a Duplicate of my Letter, having since received advice of the return of a Detachment from Detroit to opposes the advances of the Virginians upon the Ohio (who are successfully encroaching upon the most valuable Hunting Grounds of the Indians) three Forts were taken & destroyed, near 400 were made, many of them Women & Children, and a considerable number of Cattle killed. The Superiority of the Indians to the inconsiderable number of Troops that could be spared from the Gar- rison. their natural Fickleness & obstinacy, prevented sometimes more being effected—The uncertainity which turn affairs might have taken in this part of the Province. & Provisions not having arrived in time for that tedious Transport, prevented my sending more Troops into that Distant Country, I am the more easy on this account, as the Posts of Niagara 8: Detroit are in a good state of defence. If the Western Indians were more attached 8: more interested, they might originally have prevented, & still may, the advances of the Enemy; but it is their interests to protract the War, that they may live in'Indolence, receiving Presents which were at ﬁrst indispensany neces- sary, & cannot now, with safety, be withheld from them, particularly as the Spaniards are become Masters of the Mississippi 8: can by that Channel supply their wants.

I have lately received two Expresses from Sir H.

His last Despatch informs me of the arrival of the French Fleet & Army at Rhode Island, & that from the lateness of the season & other cir- cumstances their views appeared to be changed from, this Province, against him, I nevertheless employ every possible endeavour in preparing for what- ever may happen, I shall continue to do so, in expectation that they will undertake it in the Spring. In order in the mean time to divide the strength that may be brought against Sir H. Clinton, or to favor any operations his present situation may induce him to carry on, as well as to destroy the Enemie‘s supplies from the late plentiful Harvest, and to give His Majesty’s Loyal Subjects an opportunity of retiring to this Province. I have ﬁtted out two Parties of about 600 men each, besides Indians to penetrate into the Enemy’s Country by the Mohawk River, 8: Lake George, the former being chieﬂy drawn from Niagara & to rendezvous at Oswego is already marched under the command of Sir J. Johnson, the other I shall send across Lake Champlain so as to appear at the same time. I ﬂatter myself these move- ments will answer the purpose for which they are intended. Sir H. Clinton has not mentioned the arrival of Admiral Graves, but reports afﬁrm that he has blocked up the French Fleet at Rhode Island, this will render an attempt against Canada this year Impossible, yet, from the preparations formerly made by the Rebels and Monsieur De la Fayette, it is probable they may invade it by Land, for I have every day more reason to be conﬁrmed in the opinion, I gave Your Lordship in my letter of the 14th of last September. and I have undoubted proofs that they have Emissaries in this Country, but more particularly at present.

The most humble memorial of Louis Joseph Ainssé formerly employed as Indian Interpreter at the Post of Michillimakinac. The Petitioner has the honor to represent that he has served at the said Post in the said capacity, under the orders of different commanders, during the space of two years, with all the zeal 8a ﬁdelity of which a good serv-

RELATIVE TO GRIEVANCES 435 ant can be capable—from whom he has certiﬁcates which justify his advances That last autumn, by agreement with Major De Peyster, he went to Mont- real with his family to arrange his private affairs there, but under a promise which he made to the Commandant, to return to the said Post that year in the early spring having judged that his presence would be necessary to the service. Mr. Sinclair who had then arrived at the said post expressed his satisfaction to know that he would return to it. That the 12th May last the Petitioner, to keep his promise, with the con- sent of Lieut Colonel Campbell equipped a canoe, the expense of which be advanced. to take him to Michillimakinac and took with him six Indians Foxes who were returning to their village. The expenses for this purpose according to the statement subjoined 2224 Livres of 20 sous. When he arrived at the said Post Mr Sinclair received him favorably and immediately gave him orders, in writing, to go to St Joseph to bring with him to Michillimakinac, all the Canadian families who were settled there, viz Mr Chevallier his uncle. However delicate was his mission through the consequences which might result the memorialist passed over the difﬁculties &, animated by his usual zeal for the service, he accepted it without reply nor objection. He left with six canoes in each of which were three canadians. he placed in each of the said canoes twenty Courtoreiller Indians, chosen by him. These Canoes were completely provided with the necessaries for the voyage by the general association with the exception of four barrels of rum which the petitioner furnished, according to the certiﬁcate subjoined by Dugay author- ised to this effect by Mr. Sinclair £1200 currency of the said Post. The Petitioner went to St Joseph happy enough to succeed & execute there punctually the orders with which he was charged. He placed in his canoes all the inhabitants with a part of their baggage 8: brought them to ,Michillimackinac. The expenses incurred by the Petitioner for this voyage, according to the statement subjoined, amounted to 2244 Livres 0f 20 Sous. On arriving at Michillmackinac Mr Sinclair expressed to him all the satis- faction possible with his conduct he retained him during four days for ser- vices towards the Indians but on the fourth day the Petitioner believed that it was his duty to give notice that the Indians of La Baye [des Puans] having testiﬁed ome discontent that other warriors who had done less at war were better treated; it was a matter of consequence to extinguish this jealousy. Ac- cording to orders the petitioner presented them, they opened proceedings with Mr Sinclair by demanding two barrels of powder for their Village, at this demand he was excited 8: said to them, showing his hands that he would give
Page 436
436 CONDUCT OF LIEUT. GOV. SINCLAIR them two handfuls. On this answer the Chief of the Foxes left 8: the next morning went away with his band very discontented. That the ﬁfth day Mr. Sinclair sent S. Gauthier, Interpreter, to ﬁnd the Petitioner, he was much surprised on arriving at Mr. Sinclair’s to hear him say these words: “Sir, I order you to stay in the Fort & I forbid you to leave it.” He then perceived that, far from rendering him justice, he was looked upon with suspicion & a striking contrast also in the conduct of Mr. Sinclair in this respect, without any real foundation, & it grieved him beyond expression. That the. Petitioner seeing himself thus treated desired to obtain his per- mission to descend to Montreal 8: at the same time settle his accounts with Mr. Sinclair. He charged the said Mr. Dugay with this settlement, but on the presentation of his accounts, the answer of the Lieut. Governor was: “That'Mr. Ainssee, Askin & Chevalier were rich enough to pay their own expenses, that besides he had only to apply to His Excellency.” On this' report the Petitioner hazarded going to him, to inform himself of the truth of the Matter. His answer was: “That Dugay had misunderstood him,” that he had not said these words to him 8: as the Petitioner would ‘enter into the matter, he turned his back to him; on which be judged it convenient to retire. That the Petitioner had in Merchandise at the said Post 2700 Livres of twenty sous, cash price at Montreal, he wanted to take them down, he asked [permission 8: it was refused him; but Mr. Sinclair had told him that, if he left them at the cash price in Montreal, he would take them. The Petitioner consented although he feared loss, & when they knew his adhesion, he required still a reduction of £700, to which the Petitioner would not consent, rather preferring to loose everything. Mr. Sinclair has had them placed 8: the Petitioner has neither the power to descend nor to dispose of them otherwise. He was then under the necessity of leaving the Post, to which he had gone only to render himself useful to the Service. Obliged to let horses, goods 8: cattle & to abandon the effects which he could then have disposed of with advantage, if he had not found himself covered with such disgrace. But to crown his unhappiness the permission to go is given him under the humiliating condition of giving a security of some considerable amount for his good behaviour and also on condition that he would take with him Mr. Chevalier, his family and as many other persons as would be possi- ble. To this effect he ﬁtted out two canoes, 8a was obliged a little beyond Michillimackinac to take a third, having ascertained that they were not suf- ﬁcient to transport the people & their baggage.
Page 437
REQUESTS OF THE PETITIONER 437 This Expense according to the snbjoined account amounted to 2350 Livres of twenty sous. That the Petitioner having sacriﬁced his youth in the Upper Country, where he was engaged in Trade, believed that he could there some use his industry 8: his talents, in short, after having honored his engagements, he found himself with a little capital which he has employed here in landed property on which he can live with economy, and there is the great fortune with which Mr. Sinclair wishes to pay the expenses of the King. That the Petitioner, convinced of the justice and integrity of your Excel- lency trusting also to the justice of his cause, 8: his good conduct in all respects, comes with a ﬁrm conﬁdence to implore his assistance and protection. \ 1st. To obtain his reinstatement in the distinctif character of a good and faithful subject to his Majesty 8: the discharge of the outrageous security which Mr. Sinclair has laid him under. 2d. To ask your Excellency to take into consideration and examine the statements and certiﬁcates of expenses sub-joined amounting all together to the sum of 8018 Livres of twenty sons in order if the judges right to warrant the payment to the Petitioner. 3rd. To order likewise that the goods which Mr. Sinclair has detained at the said Post shall be paid for according to the price which like goods would sell for there. And ﬁnally the Petitioner believes himself to have grounds to demand an indemniﬁcation or remuneration in consideration of his journey & his services; but he shall be always content if your Excellency would grant well to him for this purpose, and on the whole he will not cease to endeavor to show his gratitude and to pray to the All Powerful for the safety and prosperity of your Excellency. ~ Aixssz.

May it please Your Excellency, The very humble address of Louis Chevallier, formerly Merchant at St. Joseph & successively employed for a number of years by Messrs. the Com- mandants of Michilimackinac to maintain the Indians in their duty and ﬁdelity towards his Majesty. The Petitioner has the honor to represent that ‘for about _thirty ﬁve years he was settled at St. Joseph, where by his conduct and behaviour under the two Governments, he ventures to ﬂatter himself to have obtained, there, the conﬁdence and esteem of those who were the trustees of authority; that hav- ing made himself beloved by the Indians in this district, he has proﬁted by the ascendency which he has over their minds only to keep them in their

PAST CONDUCT OF THE PETITIONER 439 duty and ﬁdelity towards His Majesty and His Government, since the con- quest and cession of Canada. That for some years, there having been no Commandant nor Garrison at St. Joseph the different Commandants had chosen him as the King‘s man in this district. Honored with instructions to this effect & with the execution of their orders to which he has always conformed in the character of a true and faithful subject of His Prince. That last year Mr. Barmer [Lieut Bennett] with a Detachment came to St. Joseph to endeavour to pacify the Indians, to encourage the good, reassure the weak, and bring back, if possible,-the bad to their duty (your Excellency has been informed of the result of this step) the Petitioner accompanied this ofﬁcer on his return to Michilimackinac, he was well received there by Major De Peyster and on his departure that Commandant gave him an order to con- tinue his care and to give his attention to carry out the desired purpose. That the Petitioner had the consolation of seconding the views of this wise ofﬁcer, by succeeding in bringing back their principals, so that all the nations of his post and the surrounding district, appeared, at the moment in the interest of the King. It was necessary to perfectly assure them that they approved of their propoal to go and strike at the Post of Vincennes, and at the Belle Riviere [Ohio]; they consented to this unanimously. Then it was necessary to equip them, which was done partly by the advances made by the Company and partly by the Petitioner who advanced 6000 Livres of twenty sons, and the petitioner was authorized by Major be Peyster to incur these expenses. One party composed of twenty two men went towards Post Vincennes, another of one hundred and twenty men having with it M. Du- Quindre and three Canadians went towards La Belle Riviere. The ﬁrst party having doubtless been too much engaged was quickly met and repulsed by the enemy. There were six killed and four dangerously wounded. The rest. of this party arrived at St. Joseph on the 24th of June last, nearly naked and all tattered; there has not yet been news of the second. ' That the 25th of the same month, that as the Petitioner set himself to con- sole the afﬂicted & to cloathe them, M. Ainsse having received orders from Mr. Sinclair, with a detachment of Indians and Canadians, appeared at St Joseph, they were notiﬁed by him that, either voluntarily or by force, he was to bring all the Inhabitants of the Post to Michilimackinac. The Petitioner began to obey the others did so led by his example. sixty eight years of age his wife of seventy having all his fortune in the neighborhood, ten houses, good lands, orchards, gardens, cattle, furniture, utensils and debts, of which be has made an entire sacriﬁce to obedience.

440 TREATMENT—REQUESTS That being arrived at Michilimackinac he presented himself to the Lieu- tenant Governor who received him politely at ﬁrst, but afterwards sent to search his boxes, he opened them in his presence and took all the papers they contained, which were all the letters of the Commandants & their orders, he promised to return them which he has not done. Then after that be con- ﬁned him a. prisoner in the Fort and forbad him to leave it. That after this treatment, which was as hard as unexpected, the petitioner asked for permission to go down to this Town, which was accorded him only after having furnished security to a large amount for his good behaviour. That as the conduct of the Petitioner is not blameable that he is as he has been and will always be faithful to his Prince; he has good reason to claim the protection of your Excellency which is never refused to the weak unjustly oppressed by the strong and in consequence he humbly hopes himself authorized to ask it. To pray 1st To discharge him from the security which he has given, having been unjustly considered as a suspected person at the same time that he went to show his ﬁdelity in the most striking manner. 2nd To order that the advances which he has made by order of Major De Peyster be paid to him. . v 3rd That he shall be permitted to return next spring to St Joseph to gather together the remains of his fortune and to order that his papers be sent to him. ' He is led to expect all these things from the justice of your Excellency for the preservation of whom he will never cease to pray. LOUIS Cusvxnuss. Endorsed :—Request of M.

444 INDIAN SPEECH SPEECH OF CERTAIN INDIANS Speech which the Indians have made to M. Aimee, bearer of His Majesty‘s orders, to write to their Father at Michillimakinac. FATHER, We have just received a stroke, which has made us too ill to avenge ourselves. You have always said to us that if any one did evil to your children it was done to yourself. We have received this stroke for having done your will. we hope that you will not leave us in the ﬁres that the Miamis have kindled 8: that you will help us quickly, as well as our brothers the Court aureille and Sauteus, which we ask immediately if possible 8: a great number to ex- tinguish their ﬁres which are spoiling our ground. We wait with impatience for your answer for we can do nothing without your assistance. We are faithfully Your children the Toutegatemy Mahaquoy By Nogyalousy All the other chiefs are at war with the Rebels. This council was held yesterday it sends you sixteen branches of Porcelaine.

RELATIVE TO EXPENSES ‘ 445 I am nevertheless persuaded that these expenses are greatly increased by the avidity of the Merchants in that country who taking the advantage “of the times, have raised the Prices of their goods, particularly Rum & those in demand for the Indians, to a most exorbitant & shameful height, nor is this the only evil attending their conduct, the Inhabitants who depend upon them for their little wants are obliged to raise the price of their Stock in proportion, which puts it totally out of the Power of the Troops to purchase many little things of comfort they would otherwise enjoy, while the Farmer is sure of a market from the want of Provisions for the Indians, all which centers with the Merchant, nor is there the least reason to doubt that they urge the Indians to make Demands, not only of greater quantities than are necessary 'but many articles they would themselves never think of, nor is there‘ the Power of the Commanding otﬁcers is continual prosecution is not to be conceived but by experience, to refuse materially their Demands, the alternative being too serious a consequence for them to risk—or for me to authorize unless I am empowered to do it.

Quebec 13th Novr. 1780. [B 97-2 p 5?:3] MAJOR DE PEYS’I'ER TO GENERAL HALDIMAND Ds'raorr the 16th Novr. 1780. Sm, I have the honour to acquaint your excellency that a body of Can- adians, commanded by Colonel La Balm,‘ were defeated on the 5th inst, by the Miamie Indians near their village. The Colonel and between thirty and forty of his men were killed, and Monsr. Rhy who stiles himself Aid-de- Camp taken Prisoner—He relates that they left the Cahokias on the 3rd Octr. with 41 men. That a larger body were to follow them to the Ouia, from whence Colonel La Balm proceeded to the Miamie with one hundred 8: three men, 8: some Indians without waiting for the Junction of the Troops expected, leaving orders for them to follow as well as those he expected from Post Vincent. His design was to attempt a coup de main upon Detroit, but ﬁnding his troops which were to consist of 400 Canadians & some Indians did not arrive, after waiting twelve days, they plundered the place 8: were on their way back, when the Indians assembled 8: attacked them. I have sent the Colonel’s Commissions Papers 8: a ‘Volume of his Works to Brigadr General Powell, There are many other Papers which might have been of consequence but they are quite defaced by water 8:0. Those I have sent will sufﬁciently serve to show your Excellency the dis- positions of the Canadians. Had this little army arrived here compleat, 8: Joined by soo many more, they would under such an enterprising ofﬁcer, have given us a deal of trouble. As the enemy came from the Ouia in four days, on horseback, it will account for the Miamie Indians being surprised to see them at their village before they had any accounts of their coming, and, it so happened that my scouts were just returned from that Country. But what astonished me was, that they were near twelve days at the Miamie, before we got the accounts of it here. 'See appendix
Page 449
INFLUENCE ON THE INDIANS 449 The Indians say that the few then at the village were surrounded. and did not dare stir till the Enemy retreated, at which lucky period war parties arrived, which gave them heart 8: strength to follow them. Upon the whole I believe it was the thoughts that I would allow no more goods amongst them—if they did not defend those they had—be it as it will, the Chiefs make a merit of being faithful allies, and I must improve the lucky moment, the'refore, least the Party expected should endeavour to revenge the affront, I sent off the Rangers to take post at the Miamie Town to act in concert with that Nation, which now is fairly entered. Your Excellency will see the necessity of continuing them a Trader, who I propose shall be Monsr. Beaubin (whom the- people of Post Vincent wish to hang) ordering all others in to Detroit. It will also be necessary to make those Indians a handsome present for this signal mark of their loyalty.

The necessity of a strong Force, in order to guard so extensive a (.‘ountry is evident. Your Lordship will likewise observe how very incum- bent it is upon the Commanding ofﬁcer at Detroit to take Care what kind of men he allows to go as Traders into the Indian Country.

452 MISCELLANEOUS MATTERS MAJOR DE PEYS'I‘ER TO CAPTAIN MCKEE _ Daraorr February'lst 1781. DEAR SIR, Since the affair at the Miamis something similar happen’d at. St. Joseph’s—the prisoners brought in are all Canadians except one Brady who stiles himself a Superintendent by the Commission of Helm. Brady says that they were sent by the Creoles to plunder St Josephs 8: they inform me there is not a Virginian in all the Illinois Country, nor even at Port Vin- cents. The Snake has been here a considerable time, waiting he says for you. He took his leave about a week ago but returned here for some provis- ions which gave me the favorable Oppy of Charging him with Joshuah Stile and John Harrison the former a Delaware & the latter a Shawnese who had been tampering with the prisoners and a. number of the Sailors to carry them off to the Rebels. I was under the necessity of Conﬁning these two men till I could come at the Truth of the Matter. This rash step of the prisoner obliges me to conﬁne all except these who have families. A drunken Indian named \Vashington attempted to stab the Snake but luckily miss’d him and stabbed his son, he immediately after that stabbed a squaw. I hope it is nothing extraordinary keeps you out as I heard once you was coming in to Detroit. I shall be glad to hear from you when ever an Opportunity Offers provided you are not coming in your self. I have been laid up this fortnight with a sprained ancle and not likely to get the Better.

Formerly summons were issued by the Justice and decisions given, but since we have learned that they have no such power. that mode has ceas’d—I am conﬁdent that many wish for a Revolution in order to wipe off their scores, who otherwise would be very easy under the present Government. This is greatly the case at Detroit & Will I hope Apologize for my troubling you. I have the honor to be with great respect, Sir Your Excellency’s Most humble 8: obed't Servt. A'r S.

Father, We return the Great Spirit thanks for permitting us to meet you this day in our Council House, but I am sorry that several nations of your Children are absent—vizt.—the Ottawas, Chippewas & Pottewatimies, equally concerns, but we suppose the season has prevented them, 8: shall therefore proceed to inform you of my Errand. Father, I am now to acquaint you that after the destruction of our Vil- lages by the Enemy last Fall. Our chiefs have been in constant Councils and early this spring whilst they were engaged in one, Simon Girty with a party of Hurons and some of our own Nation, delivered us a prisoner they had taken from the Enemy who conﬁrms their designs against us as early as possible this year. He was-brought for the purpose of giving us and you Intelligence, therefore we now deliver him to you, in hopes that what he’ll tell you will convince you of the danger with which we are threatened by the Enemy. Delivers Richd Rue a Prisoner. ' Father, Notwithstanding the misfortunes that have happened to your children of our Confederacy. We can-assure you they are not cast down, but that they still hold up their Heads 8: are determined to revenge themselves upon the Enemy—therefore I am come to speak to you in their behalf on business of importance to you and us both. With 3 Belts. Father, This is the Council Fire at which you and the different Nations of your Children were united, those are the Belts that bind us together and make us oneﬂesh and Blood, and you must remember the Promises of assist- ance. ' , Whenever we should be in danger, the time that we received them, there- fore it is needless for us to say more than that the Time is now come that we must demand your assistance for the Enemy are now in readiness to strike us again. Be strong Father 8: rise up with us to oppose them. Col-‘ lect all your Warriors as speedily as possible, for the latter end of this month or the bgeinning of this month will bring them into our country. A few warriors will not be sufﬁcient to oppose them, for they now make a more formidable appearance than ever. Therefore not doubting your assistance, _We take you by the hand and lead you to the front of our Villages that lay next to the Enemy. We hope you’ll be strong and encourage your children the Lake Ihdians to rise with you. Delivers 3 Belts. Father, We are yet sick with the blow we received from the Enemy, but

Delivers a small quantity of Indian Tobacco tied up in a remnant of Linen. Father, .\'ow we have acquainted you with our danger hoping that you will acquaint your children the nation round you as soon as possible. Wry Neck continues with 5 Belts in his hand. Father, These belts are addressed to our younger Brethren the Ottawas. Chippewas. and Pottawattimies putting them in mind of the league made by our forefathers in which they mutually agreed to support each other; They must now see us their elder Brethren in danger and that we are under the ne- I cessity of looking towards them for assistance as they are numerous—We see ourselves weak and our arms feeble to the force of the Enemy. ’Tis now up- wards of Twenty years since we have been alone engaged against the Vir- ginians—Exert yourselves now and join our Father to help us; and, we now> deliver these Belts and Strings to our Father that he may acquaint the Na- tions they are addressed to. with the contents—We likewise deliver for them some, Tobacco received from the Great Spirit. 5 Small Belts g The Swan, Chief of the Cherokees Speaks— Father, My business with the Shawanese Iamongst whom I reside at pres- ent) is .to support the general League of Friendship, between you‘and your Indian Children, which I do from the bottom of my Heart. Holding in his Hand :1 Hatchet Belt and scalp afﬁxed to it. Father, This Belt I rec‘d four years ago from Gov’r Hamilton, and I now show it to you to convince you that I have adhered to what was said to me upon it, and that I have also communicated the contents of it to the South- ern Nations. The good elfects of it begin already to appear as they have commenced Hostilities against the Enemy. The Snake Shawauese Chief speaks for himself and the Shade, another Shawanese Chief ' . Father, You are now acquainted with the resolutions of our Nation from our ChiefiWry Neck, and now Father you will listen to me who left our Vil- lages some time after him. This piece of Tobacco that I present you with overtook me on my way here, and was to desire me to make all the haste I possibly could to this Place, to acquaint you that the Enemy were in motion ' and coming, and that no delay should be made in coming to their assistance, as they are too weak to withstand them. Here is a piece of their Flesh taken g from them when in actual motion towards us.

DE PEYSTER QUEBEC 10th April, 1781. Sm, I have received your letter of the 8th January, reporting the defeat of a party of Rebels from the Cohokias who had seized upon the effects of the Traders at St. ‘Joseph’s—the conduct of Lieut. DuQuindre and the Indians was very meritorious; Whatever may have been the Motives of the Latter. This attempt Should Serve to Convince the Traders of the impropriety of per- mitting Large Quantities of Goods to be carried into Remote Quarters where they cannot be protected by the Kings Troops. I should suppose you have but little to apprehend from Mr. Clark’s success in Collecting a Force at Williamsbourg to attempt Detroit. The Enemy having Sufﬁcient Employ- ment in that Quarter, besides that the late cheques at the Miamis 8: St. Jos- eph’s- & the Effect Clark will know they must have had. upon the Indians, will make him cautious how he returns to that country. I doubt not however that you will have the Breach in the New Work repaired with diligence 8: take every step that may be necessary for the defence of your Post. I am, &c., (Signed) - . FRED.

Sm, Philip Rocheblave has the honor to state to you, that, as a punish- ment for his attachment to Government, the Americans took him prisoner in 1778 at the Illinois on the Mississippi where he commanded for the British Government. They plundered him in such a way as to leave nothing either for himself or his wife & family. He has undergone a long 8: cruel captiv- ity during which he has been obliged to have recourse to ruinous means of living and clothing in a country where distress was general, Whilst in addi- tion his wife who was living at the Illinois with the children was forced to use the same means, producing a mass of debts, which, since his return he has tried in vain to pay by means of his industry. In consequence of his attach- ment to Government he has refused to return to the command of the Illinois for the Province of Virginia. though they have proposed to him since his cap- tivity to indemnify his losses & shown the advantage that it would be if he would take their part. Your Excellency is a witness of his zeal in the cause of the King for whom he has already incurred a great expense last year in bringing part of his family. The rest with the mother are presently to return to Michillimakinac on their way here where he hopes to settle under the protection of the British Government. for this purpose he needs land. He asks your Excellency to accord him in the name of Government 1,000

REQUEST FOR LAND—PRISONERS 467 acres in the place called the Rideau River below the last Gallop in mounting the River Cataraquouy, that the said Rideau River is only an overﬂow of the ﬁrst which takes place in a low part of the north bank opposite Levi Island which water is lost in the River which ﬂows on the north of Michilimakinac, known here under the name of the Grand River into which it ﬂows over a considerable fall. His plan wouldlbe to form a useful 8: constant settlement there and form a store house. That by the favor of the climate 'they could leave a month sooner than from here & diminish by so much the advantage which our neighbors have over 'us on account of their climate. Hoping, Sir, you will give him a grant held under the Crown, if it is possible, if not, on any condition you like. He will not cease to make his prayers for the pros- perity and preservation of Your Excellency. Montreal the 12th April 1784 (signed) PHILIP ROCHEBLAVE‘ Endorsed I—Memorial of Mr de Rocheblave of the 12th April. Reed the 15th [B 123 p 438] FROM CAPTAIN MOMI’ESSON. UNADDRESSED DIIcHILIiIACKINAC Ismxn 15th April 1781. SIR, According to your Message delivered to me by Mr. Cotes respecting Cardinal and La Roche being sent for from this Post, I hereby inform you that the reason I had for sending those two people prisoners away from this Post, was on account of their characters being too bad for them to be enlarged with the rest of the people brought from the Illinois, they having been in Irons in the Guard house. for some time past, before I arrived at this Post, and as upon'enquiry of their characters, whilst you was ill and incapable of transacting Public Business, I found they could not be trusted from the sight of a Sentry—I judged it most advisable to send them down the Country Prisoners, of which I wrote Major de Peyster, mentioning particularly of Cardinal to him, Besides the Soldiers of the Guard had frequently represented to me the inconvenience they were put to by having the above mentioned prisoners continually in the Guard House with them, they being full of Filth and Vermin, and cook-ing their Victuals at the Guard House ﬁre, caused altogether an insufferable stench for people in health to be in. These above mentioned considerations was the cause of my sending them away Prisoners to Canada—Where I imagined a more suitable lotment would be found for them. I am. Sir, your most obedt Servt.

_ PAT'I‘ SINCLAIR, Capt 84th Regiment. [B 98 p 23] GENERAL HALDIMAND TO MAJOR DE PEYSTER , QUEBEC 20th April 1781. SIR, I have received your Letter of the Sth January. advising me of your having drawn Bills upon me to the Amount of £44,062 York Currency, which I have since honored—The frequency of these Amazing Demands is a matter of very serious Concern to me, knowing how ill they are Received at Home, and how very triﬂing the services that can be urged in Support of them. Having so often expressed my anxiety to You on this important Subject. and convinced of your paying every possible attention to it, I forbear enlarg- ing thereon. The Exhorbitant Charges of the Merchants at the Posts have determined me to send up Supplies for the Indians from hence, and I have given orders immediately to purchase and forward an Assortment (from your istimate) least any Accident should happen to retard the arrival of the goods from England, and I hope you will have no occasion, or will be able to avoid purchasing any more goods. particularly Rum—until this Supply reaches you. But this measure must not be divulged least the Traders should in the mean Time take advantage of it. I am Sir &c (Signed) Fnsn Harnnmxn Major Depeyster Endorsedz—(Copy) 81 To Major De Peyster at Detroit 20th April. [B 123 p 25]

Children (the Shawanese &c, that compose the Ohio confederacy._ Your Belts and Strings were delivered to be the other day in council. their contents were made known unto me, you desired they should be deliv- ered to your Brothers the Ottawas, Chippeways, and the other Nations who were then absent, requesting in the name of your Confederacy, immediate assistance to repel the Rebel force which were making their appearance in your country; as you are now present in this General Assembly of which 1 am rejoiced that you see with your own eyes, part of a Nation, who for a long time were absent (Ouidas) and our Friends the six Nations, who are come to your aid. I now desire that you repeat the Contents of your Embassy to your Brothers'present. Sastaritsi, then spoke on 4 Strings mix‘d Wampum. Father! I pray you to attend as also my Brothers from nigh and afar to what I am now going to relate. Brothers—You have heard of the arrival of one of our Fathers Vessels from Niagara, in her came our Brothers the Six Nations—Two of their Chiefs addressed themselves to me, and said that they hoped their Brethren would now open their Ears and attend to what was good—here is one of them (Cayashutta) that has animated us,'and that from us he looked for assist- ance. after that of his Father. The Snake, Shawanesse Chief speaks on a Belt and several strings of Wampum. Father, You see that your Children of the' Confederacy on the Ohio are here assembled—some days elapsed since we met you in Council; informing you that we were under great apprehension from being harrass‘d continually by our Enemies the Rebels, that we prayed the assistance of you our Father 8: that of your Children—These Strings and Belt we left with'you to deliver to e-y Ottawas, Chippawas, & the rest of our then absent Brethern. Brothers, We brown skins are all of one blood & I who speak to you am sent by the Confederacy of the Ohio to inform you of the Accounts received by a Prisoner, which alarmed us not a little—we thought it our Duty to communicate the same to our Father and his Children our Allies—no sooner we saw our embarrassed Situation we immediately recollected the antient Friendship which subsisted between us. we. were told that the Enemy were numerous and encroached our Country—we then thought it most advisable to come in unto you, who are the great Body, and with your assistance be enabled to drive them from out of our Country. Brothers. How could you 60

4T4 REPLY OF MAJOR DE PEYSTER plead ignorance to our situation, we applied to you last Fall but had no relief—We now make this declaration before our Father. and you our Brethern who compose this great assembly, in order that you may no more, in future, appear ignorant. Brothers,—holding Indian Tobacco— You now have heard what we have had to say to you, we now present you this herb which we have received from Heaven: we pray you to give us your immediate answer, to smoake therefrom as a few whiﬂ’s of it induces us to grant the request that may be made upon it. He then held up a Scalp with a piece of Tobacco thereto, and repeated much the same as in Conference of the 5th instant—and added Father, What I’ve now said is no more than what I delivered to you the other day'in Council, praying your assistance—a a delay may be of great consequence, but if we get up in time we may meet the Enemy ere they be upon us. Major De Peyster then spoke, Children—The Shawanese, Delawares, and [the rest of the Natibns that are of your Confederacy—I am now going to address myself to the Ottawas, Chippawas, and the Nations who were absent at the time I met you in Coun- cil, when you made your request respecting your Embassy, where you required Assistance—I told you that I would supply you with Ammunition and necessary Clothing as much as I can spare—,as to men the number I have, are employed for the defense of this Post, to keep it in security that I may receive my Children from timeto time with open Arms—I pitch upon St Dusky for a Depot, and I request that you and your Brethern the “'ar- riors in general to attend there. I can almost answer for your Brethern, that it is unnecessary to press them on to meet the Enemy, it was with difﬁculty I could prevail on them to remain here untill the great Council met, as they were continually proposing to send off small Parties of 10 and 15 men to War—I am of opinion that it would be much better that my Children gather 8: collect themselves into a great Body, by which means they will be able to frustrate the designs of the Rebels, ere they penetrate into the Indian Country, you now see that my wishes coinside vwith yours and that I am ready to support you in defeating their attempts— Children, I have last received a letter from a Trader at Rocher de bout‘ which informs me that the Enemy have taken possession of Kuskackin. and are inclined to get to St Dusky—for my part, Ildon‘t put an implicit conﬁdence in the report, as I cannot imagine them to be so far advanced—if true. we need not cry for the loss of that place. as we may then be assured that the Indians of Kushackin are Enemies to the Rebels— 'See appendix

Brothers, I now greet you all and am much rejoiced to see you all assem- bled at our Fathers Council Fire—you have heard that we brown skins are one Body, and I now tell you that we the Six Nations are come here for to open your Ears to hear what is good, and to attend to whatever our Father may say— On which delivers the (Strings The, ya, en, dinega (alias) Capt. Brandt, addressed himself to the several Indian nations, and said. I am pleased to ﬁnd that you are ready to assist your Brethren the Sha- wanese—You see me here, I am sent upon Business of importance to your several nations, I shall follow you and your Father to the camp that it is to be formed at St. Dusky, at which place I shall deliver you the Speeches of the Six Nations in presence of the Ohio confederacy who will be there. I hope when you. are acquainted with the contents of my Embassy it may furnish means to unite you more strongly in the cause we are mutually engaged. and continue our Friendly intercourse as the meeting will be general. Major De Peyster, holding [a War belt. Children; This Belt is sent to you from the Six Nations, in order to sharp- en your War Hatchets from St. Dusky. ' Delievers the War Belt to Cayashutta, who sings as is usual, and says—- Take Courage, Brethren, this is our Fathers Hatchet, we will make a. good use of it. Onishacheré a “'yandotte Chief sings the War Song, and then says-— Father, I sing because I am disposed to meet my Brethren at your Council Fire, which is to be held at St. Dusky. Egnshewey, Ottawaa War Chief takes the War‘Belt and sings, after which he says— 7 Father, you see your children are prepared to meet the Enemy, don‘t let .us see but a few of your own colour, let us see you get up with a number of them— ’ . Mashquiash Chippowey Village Chief takes the Belt 8: Speaks— Father, you see here your Children & speak well to them. you have a Strong Arm, why don’t you arise and go with us where you direct— Negig.

476 CLOSE OF COUNCIL—NEWS The Council was then closed with the following Speech by Major De Peyster. Children, I have already told you that this Belt is delivered for to sharpen your Hatchet on. and that I shall give you all the support that is necessary—— You seem to hint that I should go with you to War; my reasons are already assigned which prevent my going out with you. and I hope when you reﬂect on them. that it appear to your satisfaction—You say I sit still, but don’t you see that I am not idle—have I not raised the ground and made this place strongly fortiﬁed against any attempt whatever, that I may be able to pro- tect my children and supply them with the necessaries. Don’t suppose that your Father the King does nothing because he sits still, who has as many children as the sands of the Sea to supply. I now conclude with assuring that the ofﬁcers 8:0 belonging to your Department shall be ordered to be in readiness to attend you. (Signed) 3 AT S; DEPEYSTER, Major.

After closing of Council, arrived a young Indian in three days from St Dusky and reports that the Children of the Chief from that place (Du, you goud) report that they saw the Virginians at the Village of Kushackin—that they divided their Army in two Parties, each of which took a different rout, one by St Dusky and- the other by'the Shawanese side. The Indian Women of St Dusky have dispatched this runner with this message on four Strings of Black Wampum and a piece of Tobacco tied thereon. praying that their Father Major DePeyster to send them immediate relief, that seven days are_elapsed since' the Enemy left that place—50 men from St Dusky departed immediately in search of them. The Indians of Kushackin retired with great precipitation towards St Dusky, half naked, being surprised by the Enemy.

QUEBEC Sm, The season for the departure of the trading Canoes bound up the Grand River being arrived, & the Traders become very solicitous for their Passes, I am obliged to gratify their wishes, although I should have been glad to have heard from the Indian Countries, before they set out, which the Backwardness of the Season has prevented, I have however taken the neces- sary precaution of laying on them the strictest Injunctions of submitting im- plicitely to such restrictions as from circumstances unknown here, and the Good of His Majesty’s Service. you may see ﬁt to lay them under, and I must earnestly desire that you will pay the utmost attention to the respective des- tinies of these Traders. who I cannot help thinking under a pretext of exer- cising the Furr Trade abuse the Indulgences granted them, for that purpose, and do many things injurious to the King’s Interest, & likewise to the Repu- tation of Trade, I am not so well informed of the complicated circumstances attending that remote Trade as I could wish, or as it is necessary I should be, I. enclose to you a few hints 8: memorandums upon that Subject 8: I re- quest you will, with' your Leisure correct them 8: suggest to me all such as your long experience and knowledge of that Country, and your late observa- tions may have furnished you with that I may be the better enabled to give that Encouragement, I wish to so essential a. Branch of Trade, but at the same time carefully avoid giving Latitudes which in the present situation of aﬂ'airs might tend to prejudice what we most wish to preserve. Altho’ it is practitable to convey supplies to the Enemy, by way of Lake Superior into the Mississippi, the vast labour & diﬂiculties that must attend such an under- taking, makes it rather unlikely that it should be attempted, I am therefore desirous to give every proper encouragement to the North West Trade. Their views however will be better perceived by you, than here. and the ofﬁcer

' f 478 RELATIVE TO TRADE—NEWS you send to St. Mary's (should you ﬁnd that necessary) will be still a further Cheque upon their Conduct. I send you likewise a Copy of a Memorial from the French Traders in your environs, who. from my apprehension of supplies falling into the Enemies hands, were not permitted to carry up their usual proportion of Goods last year. From reports of aﬂ’airs upon the Mississippi, these apprehensions are not lessened. but so heavily do the Traders complain of the Losses they have sustained. that to content them I have given Passes for 100 Canoes upon the conditions I have already mentioned to you, and that whenever you see the least prospect of danger, you will not sutt'er a single article to be sent. Altho’ the observations upon the Trade to Detroit do not concern the Trade of your Quarter, Yet, their being in some measure connected has induced me to let them accompany the others—I wish you to be particular upon the subject of persons employed in the Service of Government, being permitted to Trade, as things are now situation, I fear the evil cannot be removed, men who make Hundreds yearly, would relish being reduced to their Ten or Five shillings per day—this evinces the impropriety of suffering upon any pretence what- ever, the smallest relation of good order, these people’s service having been improperly rewarded by indulging them with carrying up small quantities of goods, from Time to Time, until they at last become professed Traders.

You certainly never excited troubles at the Post of Michilimackinac during my command, nor ever troubled me with disputes relative to private prop- erty—On the contrary you have often been a Mediator in differences between seditious persons rather than I should be troubled with them—And, in all your Dealings, I have ever found you, and know you to be esteemed an Honest man,

V The two Vessels which were reported by some mistake, have been put in nearly the same repair as when they arrived. One sailing from Detroit in April & the other has been employed for some weeks past in transporting Bricks Boards Planks &c from the old Fort. The Garrison Boats which were drove away by one accident or other, I found 8: repaired also. The Trader’s servants will receive every encouragement to compleat the works. The en- closed order to the Commissary of the Post will shew that the Prisoners were not treated with inhumanity as to Provisions, their present allowance of pay will not afford them the same quantity of cloathing which they received from the Indian Store. In obedience to His Excellency’s Command I send all the information I can gather relative to Cardinal, excepting that he is a runaway Bankrupt from Detroit & that he was employed as a Guide by the Rebel Col. Clark. , The Bearer Monsieur Campion very fortunately was at the Post of St. Joseph’s to repel] the ﬁrst attack of the Pillagers from the Illinois, His Business called hiin to Michilimackinac when the second attack was made 8: the Traders plundered. ‘ I beg to 'be honored with the Generals orders relative to the conduct to be observed towards those mauraders & to any indulgence hereafter to be shewn the Pottawatalnies'who still solicit for Traders amongst them. Inclosed is the Indian Deed for this Island, which may, if not fully compre- hensive, .be altered to His Excellency-’s Pleasure. By the return of Mr. Sarayeu of the Indian Department, I am glad to ﬁnd that the Traders towards the Mississipi have been much protected by the Indians in their neighbourhood, who prevented a like accident to that of St.

But at all Events such was the alarm amongst the Indians, on the Report, of' the Enemys determination of entering their Country and penetrating to Detroit. that it became necessary to answer the demands of the several Nations, who were invited to assemble here, besides the Supplies to be sent into the Shawanese Country and the Quantity requisite to secure the Wabash Indians who were very high and insolent upon the Occasion, till they found that Linot' failed in procuring the troops he expected by the Mississippi—What remains in store, after having en- deavoured to satisfy the different nations will serve to cloathe the warriors on their Return who are always Naked, the Squaws never failing to tear off everything from their backs. before they enter the Fort, when they must be Equipd anew and also rewarded for their Exploits however triﬂing Mr Baby has joined me, with his utmost Endeavours to lessen the enor- mous expences at this Post and its dependencies, I am therefore extremely sorry that at the time we expected in some measure to bring about Your Excellency’s Wishes, the exigencies of the times should have obliged us, to pursue the old plan of Pleasing the Indians at all Events I am sensible of the Justness of Your Excellency’s Remarks that the Services which can be urged, are triﬂing in Support of the Expense. The following possibility however may be admitted. The Rebellions disposition of the Canadians of this upper country, includ- ing Post Yincents and the Illinois joined to the Natural Liking the Indians have for them in preference to the English might in Case the French &. Spaniards found means to push goods and Ammunition up the Mississippi draw the Indians-to listen to them, and if not to act against us, at least to remain Neuter. In either case His Majesty’s Troops with this present garri- son would be conﬁned to the Limits of a small fort till your Excellency could enlarge it. ~ It was the goods and the goods only that made the Miamies & the Potte- wattimies strike LeBalm & the Creoles. Some'Extra. Presents have also been well applied by Mr. Baby in defence of our Provisions, by dispatching the Indian families otherwise our provisions would not have lasted so as to have had a Sufﬁciency in Case of Emergency a supply could not have been had. I am in hopes that in a month the Fort will be in a State of Resistance against any force they can possibly bring, notwithstanding that our other Works accumulate fast. On the 23rd Instant, our Powder Magazine in the Citadel fell in. We have nothing new from the Camp at Sandusky, since the account of Broadheads having cut off the Delaware Villages, and Clarke gone down the Ohio to Kentucky to raise the Militia there, with what numbers I am not

Your Excellency need not be under the least apprehension of the Trans- port being stopp’d on Account of the Schooner Hope, on the contrary it will be greatly forwarded; had she undergone a slight Repair she must have been laid up in August, supposing she had weathered it out till then. Now it is expected she will ready to sail in July, and thereby gain one month of Transport at a season when there will be most need of it, the Master Builder tells me he must take out two hundred Timbers which are quite decayed,’ when Repaired he says she will last four years.

486 NEW FORT—INDI AN AFFAIRS GENERAL HALDIMAND 'I‘O LIEUT. GOV. SINCLAIR QUEBEC the 31st May 1781 811:, Captain ‘Brehm has communicated to me your Letter of the 12th Instant. I am pleased that the New Fort upon the Island is in such For- wardness. I am persuaded that you will employ to the Best advantage the working Season, in order to Compleat and occupy the new Post as soon as possible. Iron and Tools such as could be procured are forwarded to you. I am glad to hear that the two Vessels reported by Brigadier' General Powell to have been much damaged, are repaired, & navigating and that the Batteau which were dispersed by accident are recovered & repaired. Particular attention should be had to the place and manner in which all Boats 8: Canoes are drawn up, that the Prisoners employed in the works may not have an opportunity to escape in them— _In regard to sending Traders to St. Josephs you must be the best Judge how far the conduct of the Potowatamy Indians merit Indulgence, and you may permit Traders to go, or restrain them, just as you ﬁnd it necessary— The Potowatamies and all other Indians at Trading Posts, may be informed that it' ‘they ever again permit the Enemy to Pillage the Traders they may rest assured that a Trader will never be permitted to return to them—their being on their Hunt, or any other evasive argument will not be any more admitted as an excuse. If Traders are sent amongst them at their Request, it is their duty to protect them, and they must never leave their Villages defenceless, if they kap out proper Scouts 8: support that Intercourm with each other which the Times require—they can never be surprised—much credit should be given to the Indians towards the Mississippi, who have so faithfully protected their Traders~The good Disposition of the Indians to the Westward affords me much pleasure. I by no means wish to prevent their going to War against their and our Enemies who almost surround them 8: I recommend that it may be done immediately for their Villages, to enable them to which, reasonable supplies will allowed them—but their resorting always to Michilimackinac to ﬁt out. must consume Time & swell the expense _ already so enormous. I leave 8: recommend to you to reward the Services of Monsieur Champion, :and all other Traders who have manifested their Zeal for the King’s service 'to the Prejudice of their Private Interests, either by giving them the Prefer- ence of others, who have not deserved so well of Government by placing them in the most advantageous Trading Posts. or in such manner as you shall see ﬁt.

INDEMNIFICATION—BILLS 487 A Memorial signed by many of the Traders at Michilimackinac has been laid before me representing their sufferings by the late misfortune at St Josephs, & Praying Indemnication thereof, not to mention the Impropriety of Complying with this request, it would be opening a Door, for endless un- reasonable applications—if Monsieur Champion or any other Individuals have actually sustained Losses by their being employed in the King’s Service (and not having appointments) it is but Reasonable their Losses should be made up to them. but I imagine that the Traders rather solicit. than wait for orders to be sent to a Post, and that those in question were well pleased with their situation, if any Judgement can be formed by the regret with which others left it. In regard to Cardinal, I cannot as Civil Governor refuse to hear the Com- plaints of the Kings Subjects—his being sent Prisoner, in Irons and detained as such demanded an explanation—in the mean time you will perceive by the enclosed Extract, that I paid no more attention to his Representations than Common Justice required, and if 'I had been at ﬁrst supplied with the Charges now produced, I would never have admitted him to Bail, which I have now recalled 8: remanded him to Prison—— Whatever Prisoners have been and may hereafter be taken upon such In- cursions as the late one at St. J oseph’s, are to be allowed Provision, such as other Labourers, and made to work, Comfortable Cloathing must likewise be provided for them. Your letters advising of your several Bills dated the 12th 8: 21st Feb’y, and 12th May, amounting to £38,026, 10, 10 are honoured. _ I am Sir your most obedient most humble Servant (signed) FRED HALDIMAND To Lieut.

490 NAVAL INTERESTS—COMPLAINTS The ﬁrst part of the Letter you have honored me with upon that subject refers to my interference with the internal (Economy. of the Naval Depart- ment. The state in which the vessels were in, laying aside the hasty reports made of them, required some interference. & General Hadlimands letter, received since, directs the very steps which were taken to render them serviceable. Captain Mompessons complaints shall he answered to very fully, 8: I beg leave now to trouble you with some Information respecting them, It will be dilﬁcult to ﬁnd out why He should bring in as a complaint my deferring a publication of His Majesty’s decision on the rank of Lieut Governors, as any Rank in the Army with the charge given to me by the Commander in Chief placed him still in the same situation in which he now stands. The enclosed paper No 1 is a copy of my letter to him relative to Hip- worth—No 2 is a Copy of the order 28th April—Phillips has done no duty in the Indian Department, or in any other but that in which he was placed by Captain Mompesson, Serjeant Langdon is D. Barrack Master and does the same Regimental Duty as he did in Major ])ePeyster’s Time, & since I have been at the Post Serjeant Dodymead was detached all Winter, and he was - put in orders to oversee the Workmen. when he was called in—I am at a loss to conceive how any of these matters can be tortured into Complaint. - Whatever the representations against me may be, or whatever weight they may carry with those to whom they are made, my attention during my stay here shall be, as it has been, invariably directed to the good of the King’s Service 8: the Establishment of the Post.

Virginian Troops we are certain cannot be spared to act in Conjunction with the Settlers upon the Frontiers, who alone are the Enemies to be apprehended in that Quarter and their views are merely by taking advantage of the Times to establish themselves, in good settlements, which, if the Indians suffer them to do (and surely they can prevent it) they will ﬁnd it diﬂicult, after they have tasted the sweets of their Situation to re- move them. I The Body of Indians assembled at St. Dusky, if Vigilant and Enterprizing have it in their power to Repel all attempts that can be made, but it is to be apprehended that as long as these people are supplied with Provisions &c. from Detroit, they will not he very desirous of leaving their Camp. but patiently wait for Events—Should this happen, the Expence to Government will be increased, and the active Season wasted.'while the Enemy are eﬂfect- ing their purpose and by degrees Establishing themselves in the country—It is unfortunate that the service could not permit so short a delay as the waiting for Indian goods—Expected from here would have occasion the more so. as the alarm‘of the Indians (perhaps fabricated for the purpose) have turned to nothing, and the Evil consequences which might follow their being supplied by the French and Spaniards from the Mississippi, altho’ very probable yet too distant to be alarming—I have determined in future, to supply the wants of the Indians, as mentioned to you in a former Better, from England, or this place, and to Transport the Goods at the King’s expence—This last resource will, I hope in some measure have the desired Eﬂ‘ect. assisted as I expect-and am persuaded it will be by you and the ofﬁcers under your Command.

I shall send the little sloop adventurer to roche de Bout with provisions & some cloathing for the Warriours— Mr Laurimus I am told spares you one thousand wt of powder in case of necessity— I am anxious to hear if the Intelligence you received of the enemy’s motions .are conﬁrmed or not, If they are in motion the Indians may be assured from the news we have from below that they will have no enemy to oppose but the Inhabitants of Kentuck, unless Clark should bring 50 or an hundred with him—— I make not the least doubt but you recommend strongly to the Indians to stick together. The Little war is by no means the thing—Please to give my Compliments to Capt. Thompson and tell him that I have sent Provision to the roche de bout of which his people will have a share, they must however land for it there—I am so very ill with the Head Ache at present that I have it not in my power to answer his Letter— The man you mention coming with Letters from Post Vincent to this place has not yet made his appearance.

Mr. Ainse troubles the General with representations equally ill supported, as neither had any right to produce an account in which all the Traders were not concerned. They being so bound by their general agreement, I shall how- ever examine with attention their accounts and take the opinion of men in commerce here as the equity of their charges in part or in whole—being at a loss to produce the reasons you demand for supporting in Law a refusal of their payment. The enclosed certiﬁcates may in some measure account for their being unpaid hitherto, and as no account from either was tendered to me I am not to blame for the trouble which they give to the General.

506 RELATIVE TO EXPENDITURES MAJOR DE PEYSTER TO SECRETARY MATTHEWS DETROIT the 8th August 1781 Sm, I received your letter of the 24th June inclosing Monsr. Chevalliers petition to the Commander in Chief respecting a sum of money amounting t0'6000 Livres advanced for the Indian department. You will please to inform His Excellency that Mr. Chevallier had my orders to equip those partys of Indians, which I found necessary to send towards the Wabash, and Ohio. That I look upon the sum expended to be moderate. considering that agreeable to custom he found himself under the necessity to clothe those Indians afresh who had been defeated and returned quite naked. My intentions in sending the above partys were in order to make a diversion, and to secure the alliance of the Pottawatamies. Their defeat answered the purpose of securing their alliance, they have returned to the same place, and have met with another drubbing, being just returned with the news of having left nine dead in the ﬁeld, three of which were Principal Chiefs sons, whose Bones their nation will not fail to visit often.

It is to be hoped however that they will see the necessity of keeping together yet awhile. as it is most certain that Clarke as soon as he can get a reinforcement from Kentuck, will endeavor to avenge this alfront. I am sure you will not fail to instill into their minds that if they beat Clarke, which they certainly will do, if he makes a, Stand or advances towards them, they will recover their Hunting Grounds, and their descendants will bless their memory, Otherwise should he escape this time, the next army will make them repent their folly.

It is necessary to remark to your Excellency that the greater part of the Expenses for the Indian Department has arisen from the charges made by the Trader unauthorized so to do in their Wintering Grounds. Some of those charges were requisite. The scanty supply sent by the Kings Can- noes, and always too late for the Post, will be scarce sufﬁcient to stop that Practise. The Indians cannot be deprived of nearly their usual quantity of Rum,

They agreed to send a Scout which returned soon after with two' Scalps but no news. The 7th we proceeded and arrived within 30 miles of the Falls on the 9th inst. Where the Indians after holding a Council sent off another scout who arrived with two prisoners soon after. They informed as that the result of a large Council that Clarke held with the Principal oﬂicers in those parts was that no Expedition was to' be carried on this Season against the Indians, who when they heard what the prisoners said, got entirely out of the notion of going any further. The Shawanese who had the directions how we were to proceed gave it over. We then got Capt. Brant & the Mingoes to take their place.

Brant and the Mingoes moved a little further down to see what number would follow— Captain McKee likewise follow’d with intention of being with me the next morning—But ﬁnding two hundred (more than he expected) induced him to strike at Boons Fort or Lins Fort. On their march they fell in with a C0]- onel Cloyd whom they killed and destroy’d most of His party with the loss of three Hurons and one Miamis. Captain McKee is returned, but part of his Indians left him before he fell in with Cloyd. I'have waited here 5 days by desire of the Indians and intend staying two more as an Indian reported the enemy were advancing. We do not believe this news as all the prisoners conﬁrm that Clarke is not able to raise a sufﬁcient number of men to make another eﬁort this fall.

[B 122 p. 135] ' CAPTAIN MCKEE TO MAJOR DE PEYSTER UPPER Snawaxrsn VILLAGE, Sept’r 26th 1781. DEAR Sm,—-I returned to these Villages yesterday and take the earliest opportunity of informing you thereof. My letter of the 26th ulto. dated in the Miamis near the Ohio, with the several papers accompanying it would inform you of everything material to that time. Here the Indians seemed to think that their success two days before against the Second Division_ of Clark’s Army would ensure them peace for some time in their Villages imagining that this would disable him from any further attempt this year. I endeavored to convince them that as there was so large a Body of them then collected, that it would be prudent to watch his motions some time longer and to send Scouts towards the Falls and endeavor to gain some cer- tain accounts of his future intentions in consequence of this we fell down the River some miles where I found again that it would be difﬁcult to keep them together long, therefore advised our proceeding towards the Falls keep-

INDIFFERENCE—SUBSEQUENT OPERATIONS - 517 dug out scouts continually before us, and that if the Enemy did not advance, that we should attempt drawing them into an action in the neighbourhood of the falls where their main body-lay, and by a further success totally destroy their designs of carrying an EXpedition into the Indian country. They were reluctantly brought into this measure till we arrived at the mouth of Ken- tucky, where we waited the return of our Scouts who joined us the next day with two oﬁ‘icers’ scalps taken the day before at the Falls. as nothing material was learned by this of the Enemies Intentions yet we prevailed upon them still to keep on towards this place, and to keep out other Scouts who could meet us upon our way,'but to my surprize they stopt within 25 miles of it for them. they‘returned the third day in the Evening with two prisoners whos account was that Clark had called a General Council of the 'Field Ofﬁcers of the several Counties, that the result thereof was not then made Public but that it was the general opinion of the country that they could not assist him in carrying on an Expedition this Season. this Intelli~ gence increased the indifference of the Indians about attacking the Enemy and many of them began to turn back others dispersing into small parties to plunder Houses. The Rangers also ﬁnding their provisions exhausted returned from this. However a number of Indians still inclining to go for- ward determined me to following them as far as there was a probability of getting them to do anything. the same evening we arrived within 15 miles of the Falls and not ﬁnding ourselves in numbers sufﬁcient to put in execution our ﬁrst plan it was here agreed to cross the country and attack some of their small Forts, or infest the Roads. the second day we arrived near the, waggon Road leading from the Falls to the upper Forts here we met a party of Miamis who had been separated from us two days and who a few hours before upon this Road had fallen in with a party of the Enemies light horse escorting a number of Families who were ﬂying from the upper Forts upon being apprised of our being out. they killed a number and dis- persed the rest. This Intelligence induced us to take Possession of the' Ground they had drove the enemy from and to wait their coming to bury their dead. accordingly they came next morning but before the Indians were posted to receive them owing to their being busied in collecting the plunder found upon the ﬁeld. The exchanged a few shots with the Indians in front and ﬂed. however greatest part of them were killed & taken with some I ofﬁcers of rank. We lost three Hurons amongst whom was their prin- cipal warrior one of the best Indians with us and a great loss to our party. after this we retired to our Baggage in order to consult what could be further done. the Lake Indians would listen to no proposals and thinking they had prisoners and Scalps sufficient did not
Page 518
518 ATTITUDE OF MORAVIAN INDIANS even halt upon this Ground. , here again we proposed to them taking Boons Fort in our way and endeavour to draw them out, destroy their cattle and otherways distress them as much as was in our Power but the Hurons discouraged by the loss of their Chief and likewise being left by their younger Brethren that the whole might return home which was agreed to by the other Nations—we ware never able to ascertain our numbers being con- stantly left by small parties who’s View was only to plunder, many of those are not yet returned. Upon the whole since our ﬁrst setting out from the best computation I am able to make there has been near to two hundred of the Enemy killed and taken amongst whom are near thirty oﬁicers some of considerable Rank but how far it may effect their future operations it is hard to say however should they still attempt any thing we are certain their num- bers will not be so great, particularly as we understand the General clamou‘r of the Country is against Clarke for his ill-treatment of the Militia. It would be good policy however to watch him till the Season is further advanced if the Indians could be possibly prevailed upon, perhaps if they ware informed that the Supplies intended for them [would be sent out it would prevent their returning to Detroit. Mr. Elliot return‘d also yester- day from the Moravian Towns and informs me that the party be accompanied to that place ware detained there a long time and amused by the Moravians who were secretly sending Intelligence and endeavoring to bring the Enemy upon, them to cut them off which at length they discovered and then fell upon them and are bringing them away by force the Hurons are disposed I understand to place them at Upper Sandusky where they will still be too convenient to correspond with the Enemy, and tho’ they may not be even concerned for the future yet from this Situation they will be blamed for it. However a Message with your advice to the Indians upon it may .alter this matter there is Six of their Teachers taken with them. the principal appears to be a Jesuitical old man and if I am not mistaken employed by the Enemy tho he denies it. if the whole of those white people can be removed from the Indians it will be so much the better for it is not likely they will be our friends whilst they have such Teachers. Messengers are arrived from the Southern Indians by whom we. learn that they are all still heartily engaged against the Enemy and prosecuting the War with vigor. they have not as yet delivered their Speeches so soon as they do shall inform you of them should there be anything material, in the mean time am with respectful (.‘Iompliments to Mrs. DePeyster and Gentlemen and with great respect Dear Sir, Your most obedient 8: very Humble Servant ' A McKEE Major DePeystcr 1781 Septr 26th To Major DeI'eyster [B 123 p 129] ‘

I approve much of your scheme 8: now send you some things with which you will endeavor to stop the Shawanese 8: Delawares from coming to Detroit, by assuring them I will send off a Vessel with Goods to the Roche de Bout as soon as I hear from you that they will consent to send there for them, or at Sandusky if you should think it more convenient. I leave you to make the speech which you think best calculated for the occasion I shall only give you one Hint which is to tell them that I have Stopt the Rum nor will further give or suffer one drop to leave Detroit till I am convinced that Clarke has given over all thoughts of entering their Country, this I shall do out of re- gard for the Indians for whom only I can fear. If the Goods are to be sent please to let me know who will be at Roche de Bout or elsewhere to make

Joseph’s persevering and spirited Conduct will furnish the Indians in that Country, with an Example worthy their' Imitation, and you, with an oppor- tunity representing to them the facility of defending their Country against any Incursion in the power of the Rebels to make. provided they are deter- mined mutually to oppose them, and it is painful to reﬂect that by their obstinacy, or unsteadiness, so favourable an occasion of Extirpating that army has been lost, of which, the Success of inconsiderable a Party is too evident a proof. The Bills for £35,225 13s 61/4d, agreeable to your Letter of Advice have appeared, and I have accepted them, but I cannot help expressing my sur~ prize, not only at the astonishing amount of those Bills, so soon following the last, but at so great expence being incurred at all, after you were made acquainted with my intention and were given to expect an immediate supply of Indian presents from hence.

A meeting was held here yesterday by the Chiefs of the several nations at which they returned thanks to the Six Nation Deputies for the amiable speeches delivered by them in the names of the English 8: Six "Nations giving the strongest assurances of their always continuing to adhere to their advice—they also thanked those Deputies for the attention shown by them to their Interest during the Summer whilst threatened by the Enemy with an Invasion and they likewise told them by a large belt that as they had given them reason now to expect their assistance, that nothing would be so satis- factory to them as to see the Six Nations turn their attention towards Fort Pitt as the source of all the Enemy’s capability to distress their Country and that whilst the enemy are in possessibn of this door into it they can never live in either ease or safety that therefore as their arm when joined to that of their Fathers the English was strong and sufﬁcient to accomplish what they. would undertake, they now beg’d they would consider this matter of equal importance to the whole and that they will be always ready to join their small assistance. I had an opportunity at this Meeting of mentioning to those Chiefs the necessity of watching the Enemy till the Season was so far advanced that they would not be able to come and with respect to the cloathing intended for them by their Father, I was certain in this case he would send it to them provided they did not crowd to Detroit—they were thankful and approved of

INDIAN IMPERTINENCES 537 with, or afraid of giving offence to the generality of Indians, but their neces- sary Wants must nevertheless be supply‘d or we must give them up a prey to the enemy. They cannot hunt to furnish themselves. whilst they have a part in the War. As to what your Excellency styles superﬂuities, I have had repeated Quarrels with them on that Head. A They say they are all provided with horses (canoes not being used by the Shawanese, Mingoes. Delawares, Potteuattimes &c) and having been accus» tomed to Saddles they cannot do without them. The Enemy use riﬂes, they therefore must have Riﬂes, to be on a footing with them. That the Fuzees we give them are only fit to make trammels of and in fact they give them to the Squaws for that purpose. It would be tiresome. to repeat all their impertinences. but I must give Your Excellency some insight into the temper of those people. About a week ago Mr. Alexander, McKee Depy Agent. sent in an Indian named Mor- ' gan. who had not been in here for two years past, recommending him in the strongest Terms. I order'd Mr Baby to equip him handsomely to give him some articles for his family. and send him to me to receive a present of silver Works. with which I decorated him as ﬁne as a Miamis. “Morgan arey0u content? Yes father. but won‘t you give me a riﬂe. it will be well bestowed. I know how to use one. I gave him a Riﬂe. “Father you have only given milk at one breast. I would \n'llingly have a Kegg to r speak to the young men when I get home. in order to rouse their Spirits to Martial deeds." I gave him the Kegg. “Father my saddle was stolen last night You surely will give me a saddle? in consideration of his great services and what he still might be of, I gave him_ a conditional order to Mr Baby which he protested. not having any in store. Now my intentions were to have given him my own saddle and housing. rather than he should be disc-on» tented. But the ﬁrst accounts that I heard of him, were, that on being refused at the store. he threw down his load in the street. mounted his bare backed horse and Rode off to his village. These are. circumstances which- will frequently happen. but I shall not in future trouble you'r Excellency with a detail of them. nor would I suﬁ'er them tamely had I a Regiment in this garrison, in which case.

I request of you to inform me whether or not the report I have received respecting them be true and when I have your reply to this,_I shall then speak further— Captn Pipe then said— Father! Tis very true what you have said. and as the Moravian Teachers are here present with us. we must take care that they send no more intelli- gence to the Enemy—You say. true. these people did write letters for the Kooshacking Delawares who were once my people but now at Fort Pitt— Major De Peyster then put the following Interrogatories to the Moravian Teachers who replyed as under. - Q.

' A. Being obliged to draw near to the Kooshaking Indians we were often importuned by them to write to Fort Pitt and after two years residence with them we found they were rather troublesome which obliged us to quit their Towns and retreat to our former villages as we had long declined writing for them. we drew their resentment upon us, since when we have never wrote any.

I wish to be informed whether the Christian Indians are desirous that their teachers remain amongst them? ' Captn. Pipe replies. Father! I can say nothing in answer to your question where the Christian Indians mean to place them, but I imagine it will rest intirely with you and if you have no objection we shall be glad to have them with us to instruct our people— ' Major I)e Peyster then said— Children the Delawares Since it is your desire that the teachers remain with you. I agree to it. until the leneral in Chief‘s‘pleasure be known—My design in having them brought in was to learn whether or not they had been meddling with Public Matters, for if they had I should have witheld them, but since I ﬁnd they were compel’d to do what they did I admit of their going back'with your people. provided they behave themselves as good Subjects—— [The Moravian Teachers say they never rec'd any speeches from the Com~ mandant of Detroit, or else would have made an answer— Major Dc I’eyster then continued his speech to Captain Pipe—— With respect to the particulars of your speech which concerns the Six Nations in ('leueral.

The General at Quebec who commands throughout this Country desires me to inform his Indian Children that as the War may be of long duration and he has many children to support, that he wishes they content themselves with what is really necessary, as he promises to provide for his Indian Chil- dren as long as they are engaged in his war, but they must not open their hearts for everything which strikes their fancy but content themselves with what is useful, Your father at Quebec says further, "that your Brethren the Indians in Canada have requested that Liquor be witheld in some measure, for they ﬁnd it is more destructive to their brethren than the Sword, he therefore recommends that you avoid drinking to that excess but be advised by your brethren below—as I understand that the Christian Indians are pre- vented by their religion from taking an active part in the war, I shall order something to be delivered to those who have come in to see me. Major DePeyster then addressed the Mohawks telling them he was satisﬁed with their manner of acting and that they should receive the same treatment as the rest of his children who have done his will. “Extract from the minutes , “J.

Buckagihitas Delaware Chief speaks on a War belt and sings the war song— . Brethren! I salute you all and pray you will listen to what I am going to say to our father, I could wish that our uncles the Hurons were present, that they might see this War Belt which they introduced amongst us Delawares and we 'were the ﬁrst of our Nation who readily accepted it from their hands, after the Kooshacking Indians had refused it. It’s sufﬁciently notorious that we have made use of our fathers ax ag‘st the Enemy for these ﬁve years past as may appear by the blood we have made ﬂy throughout the Frontiers and we now ﬁnd that it has made in part this ax dull which has obliged us to come in to our father who alone is able to sharpen it for us. by supplying us all with Riﬂes and other Implements of war to enable us to continue the war. Father! This War Belt is not only for war' but serves amongst us brown skins as a token of alliance and amity— Major De Peyster then said— Children the Delawares It gives me pleasure to ﬁnd that you have readin accepted from the hands of'your uncles the Hurons my ax and that you have exerted yourselves for the Kings cause.— Children! I’m extremely satisﬁed to see the zeal you shew to-day in pre- senting the ax before this assembly in order to renew the intent of its first presentation. and I assure you that your exertions are as necessary as ever, and I make no doubt from your past actions but they will be continued. It’s now ﬁve years since I have taken you all by the hand and that this ax has runited us together in the same cause since which every effort we have made against [our Enemies has prov'd successful. but should any of us hereafter let any part of this ax go, we may not continue to be so—I well know that there are many bad birds who report amongst you ﬁctitious stories,“ it’s therefore proper you should attend to what I say as you will then hear the truth only. I now return the ax to you who have particularly distinguished yourselves as warriours' and I assure you that your father the King is as strong as ever— the. things you stand in need of shall be delivered to you. Buckagihilas Speaks. after each‘Warrior had sung the war song. Father! You see with how much alacrity we have hastened to sharpen your ax and its my duty to recommend to you to provide for my people good

DEMANDS AND ASSURANCES 545 Riﬂes which may kill at a distance, otherwise the Enemy would have the ad- vantage over us. as they are well armed—we want good Kettles, Tomhawks and other necessaries for “warriors—the Tomhawks we received formerly were of no use as they would brake to pieces not only on the heads of the Enemy but on the Smallest branch in the woods I therefore pray you will order us good strong Tomhawks. Major De Peyster then said Children! I have listen’d to your demands which are rather great how- ever you shall receive your share as much as my store can afford I am sorry that my Kettles are small and my Tomhawks no use to you but I’m only authorized to give you such as are sent for that purpose. The General in Chief at Quebec writes me that this War has been of long duration and may continue longer, he wishes that his Indian Children be content with what he provides for them as they must know he has many to support, he says he never will abandon his children but send them up such things as are really necessary for them his motive in conﬁning you to what is necessary only “i that he may be the better able to continue his Supplies—he says further that the Indians below with him desire that Liqur be restricted as they ﬁnd it prejidicial to you because you drink to excess—the weather being severe I shall order a Sufficiency for your journey,— Buckagihilas says Father! I have one thing more to mention to you which is the surprize that my people and myself are in at your allowing the Moravians to return after having them brought in to you, for we know them to be our Enemies who try to do us all the injury they can. I therefore most earnestly request of you in behalf of myself and people that you send for them and keep them - close-- Major De Peyster then said Children! As soon as I had heard that the Moravian Teachers and their adherents had arrived at Saindooskey and that the Hurons had given them a spot of land in order to have them under their Eye, I immediately sent a belt to Captain McKee desiring him to send them in as I wanted to examine them. He informed me that Captain Pipe and Buckagihilas were bringing them in but sometime after Captain Pipe arrived with them. He told me that Buckagihilas could not come in with him. I examined the Moravians in hi presence and could ﬁnd no harm ag’t them. He told me as they were with us they could do injury to the cause. he desired I would allow them to go back to take care of their families who were starving in the woods, on which I consented to their returning to Saindooskey on their behaving as good 69

EXHORTATIONS AND ASSURANCES 551 You asked me for many things and asserted that you were entitled to a Supply of necessaries as some of your people were now at war against the Rebels towards the Falls of the Ohio—it is well that you commence following the example of your brethren by acting against the King’s Enemies; You should have -done so long since and I would have taken care to prevent your wants by maintaining the Miamis Town. ‘ in order to render yourselves happy in future, you must on your return to your Villages send Deputies to your several nations that border Owabash and inform them that since the Rebels have deserted the Post you are determined not to let them return amongst you and send Deputies to this place to ac- quaint me with their sentiments. If I withhold Traders from amongst your people it is to avoid injuring you by putting an ax into the hands of the Enemy to strike at me and my Children, what I have recommended to you is not difficult on your part to perform which is to keep back the Enemy should they attempt to come up the Wabash or by land once more, the situation of your country admits of it, you see that the Delawares keep their Ground clear, for should the Enemy return hereafter and I get information thereof; 1 shall then naturally think that my Children in that quarter are a sleep, or wish to be so and it will then be out of my power to send them traders to supply them with their necessaries, you plainly see that the Enemy is too far distant that I, should have anything to apprehend from them 8: that it is for your good only I give this advice and hope you’ll advantage therefrom—that your People may not be ignorant of your English father'being strongly united with the brownskins in general you see here Deputies from the Six Nations Ottaawas from Michilimackinac and others too tedious to mention who are always here to testify that the English and the Indian Nations are but one and why should not you the Mascontins and Qui, qua bous with those who border the Wabash follow their example—as you are come in to see me I shall order such things as is proper for you, but with respect to ammunition and necessaries for those who are absent I cannot allow of any unless I see them here, as it is seldom properly divided therefore whenever I hear you are sincerely engaged in the war and you shew yourselves in number I shall then take the opportunity to give such ammuniton and cloathing as is necessary for you. Children! On your return I request of you to tell the Ouittanougs (that killed McCarty and made two prilsoners last year) “that I do not approve of their manner of making war as I am informed that they had taken a french 'man in the same action and allowed him to return home again. this is‘not acting according to my orders. it is your duty to make all prisoners you can who appear in arms against the King your father— (delivers several strings of wampum to each nation)

Ford. [B 98 p 121] ' \ THE OUTLINES FOR A REFORMATION OF EXPENSES IN THE INDIAN DEPARTMENT It has been a common custom it seems of late with the Indians on their return from Hunting to make an Oﬁering to the Governor or Commanding Ofﬁcer at the Posts of Michilimack-inac 8: Detroit in particular of a part of the produce of their chace in Furs of diﬁerent sorts, as likewise upon their getting in their Harvest for those of the Villages adjoining to these Posts-to make them a considerable Present of (1an & Grease, all which commodities these Gentlemen have considered as due perquisites of their places, to which by the tenor of their commission they are entitled, and which they have ac- cordingly converted to Cash, in the most advantageous manner for their own beneﬁt. What the quantum of these Presents is accustom’d to be I have not been able to ascertain, but understand from diﬂ’erent authority that as the Indians expect on their parts presents in return, so their generosity is excited in proportion to that of these ofﬁcers in this respect. Now from the above state of the case is it natural to Expect that the Indians should either be dis- couraged from coming to the Posts & putting us to the Expense of feeding them whilst there, which is always the consequence, or that an Oeconomy should be observed in the distribution of the necessities supplied by Govern- ment, or allow’d to be purchased as Presents to the Indians? Whether the _Power of making these presents therefore & feeding the Indians, is commit- ted to the hands of Lt. Governor’s, 8: Commanding ofﬁcers of these Posts-— or to Deputy Superintendent or Commissaries of Indian Affairs, it matters not in the least I think to Government. Individuals will be more or less con- scientious just as it may happen, and it is perhaps just as likely (if not more so) to ﬁnd that degree of conscience not to push the abuse to excess among the Military Line. as amongst the class of People employ’d in the Indian De-

Such a provident precaution in sending up to the Posts timely supplies of Presents (upon proper & moderate calculations) so as to obviate totally the pretence for purchases which has set open another wide door for abuse. not only from combinations being enter‘d into by the Traders to take advantage of this Public necessity, but from those ﬁnding an interest in it who ought not, as it has clearly appear’d that the greater the part-bases 8: presents the more proﬁts they ultimately produce. An exactness in requiring a most particular account of the disposal of all presents. Finally by establishing some ('heck upon the number of Indians at present said to be'victualled at the several Posts—but the mode of this check I confess myself unequal just how to point out—with these regulations, or rather taking them as a rough outline for framing others. I repeat there can be little doubt of a most considerable reduction in the Indian Expenses. and this without bringing on any ill consequences from giving discontent to the Indians themselves, which perhaps the measure of striking oﬂ" or reduc- ing any indulgences granted them of late years (however unprecedented
Page 557
CERTIFICATES 557 before) might occasion 8: which for the security of the Posts & communica- tions under prescnt circumstances it might be bad policy to risque the Friend- ship of the Indian Nations in general being perhaps to be depended upon no longer than whilst it is purchased. one circumstance only more appears, that upon any reduction or dismission of Individuals at present employ’d in any branch of this Department, care should be taken to remove them away from the Posts. and the power of giving impressions to the Indians out of pique 8: resentment. by a misrepresentation of facts, that might lead to troublesome consequence.

DEAR Sm, I have waited in daily expectation to hear from you, especially as there has been a report spread in this place (which came from Fort Pitt) that Lord Cornwallis surrendered his little Army to Washington who besieged him in York Town and Gloucester Virginia. The Same reports say that the Six Nations have offered to make peace with the Americans 8: upon hearing this I spoke to Brant upon the subject. who says he’ll forfeit his life it is not true, unless it has been done by some of the Indians in the Neighborhood ' of‘Fort Pitt. where he says there are a. few families of the Six Nations who have been neutre during the war. We have had no Express from Canada yet therefore are in the dark of what is going on there. The Inclosed Speech will let you into what was the sentiments of the Indians at Niagara last fall. If the accounts from Fort Pitt concerning Lord Cornwallis be true it may

If _an attempt against Detroit was really an agitation I conceive itmust have been upon the Original Co-operating plan, and if that is laid aside for New York they cannot I should think, spare a Force equal to so arduous a task as Mr. Clarke‘s is represented to be in all events, I think it must have reached the knowledge of Major DePeyster, and of course been commu- nicated to you. my not yet having heard from you. conﬁrms me in the opin- ion that everything is quiet in that quarter, you will nevertheless communi- cate the enclosed to Major DePeyster giving him orders to take every pre- caution possible for the safety of his Post, as well in regard to securing all the Provisions he can from the settlement should the enemy advance, as for the defence of the peace. In the great uncertainty I am of what may happen here. or the necessity I may be under to make a Diversion in favor of Sir Henry Clinton I'cannot think of lessening my Force, already so incon- siderable should you therefore ﬁnd it absolutely necessary to reinforce Detroit there is no alternative but with drawing one or two Companies of the Rangers from Oswego. which 1 hope will in a short time _be secure from

John Johnson‘s second Battalion I am but too sensible that the force at these posts should rather be augmented than diminished but we are governed by contingencies and not contingencies by us we must therefore act for the best. ‘ It may not be amis to communicate the inclosed intelligence to Lieut Governor Sinclair, with directions to give 'what assistance may be in his power with such Indians as he can collect should the attempt be made. I send you some news-papers they contain all in my power to tell you. You will please to forward them after perusal.

ADMONITIONS AND ASSURANCES 569 should be pleased if this day I could hear that the Rebels have followed your example but by report from Fort Pitt I ﬁnd that they have acted quite in a different manner and I begin to fear for your Chiefs who have impru- dent enough to go and speak to them. ~t‘l1ildreu! I must continue to you to continue to avoid cruelties that the Great Spirit may give success to our undertakings. for be assured he does not take pleasure in them. it will yet turn out that the perpetrators of these acts of cruelty will stiffer the vengeance they merit—with respect to your demands such as 1 am used to give to my children 1 shall order to be provided for you. I have to advise you to get cloathing ammunition or such things that may be necessary for you at home for the skins you have brought here to trade and avoid buying of that pernicious Liquor (Rum) which so often deprives my children of their reason, for such as carry from hence necessaries ﬁnd the ' advantage when they arrive at their Village. while those who take rum per- ceive they gain nothing but indisposition—the General with the Indians ’below have requested that Liquor be withheld as they ﬁnd that the Indians drink to excess and ruin their constitutions. Children! Notwithstanding what I've said to you at this time I fear you may let the Enemy pass you unmolested, if you do. be assured that hereafter, you and those who are behind them will become a Sacriﬁce. should they come and you oppose them at your Village if you ﬁnd them too strong you can retreat to the Miamis and if overpowered there then come in to me, united we shall be strong enough to defeat all attempts that may be made against us— (‘hildreni I address this speech equally to you all with the distinction only that you who have produced Prisoners shall be treated with greater mark of Esteem than those who come here to trade only.

As the two vil- lages are the refuse of all the malefactors of all the other. nations of which the two chiefs are Dougnrne Sauteux, the one named Segurnac S: the other Macquivois who have their families near Michilimackinac 8: it would be easy for the leader of the party to send them with the belts 8: we would by these means keep back the intelligence which they would have given to the enemies. During this time we could bring the barges 8: ammunition 8: go to join the little army at the entrance of the Chicagous where is a portage of half a league in good weather, in this waylwe could come without difficulty to the Illinois. Another plan for the same Expedition 8: one which would have still fewer difﬁculties. ' The small army would leave Detroit in the same way but instead of con- tinuing their route by this same river, they would turn & pass La Baye where the Folles Avoines, Sacs, Foxes, Puans & the Aganvois have their villages established on the bank of the river which we would pass. In this way we would take a few of each nation so as not to create any Jealousy 8: to keep up a good feeling. The expenses of this expedition would be in presents for I the nations, coats for the chiefs 8: some medals, belts 8: ﬂags. One ﬁeld piece & four pieces which would be ﬁxed on the barges would not fail to command respect for the little army. passing before these nations & would be a great resource if the Spaniards should make any movement. If his Excellency would honor me with his conﬁdence, & give me an interest in this expedition I would prove to him that my zeal has no limits in defending King George’s standard. I would like that my company should be formed on arriving at‘Detroit & that I should be given permission to name my ofﬁcers, knowing the brave subjects who have no fear of their lives when doing their duty. If he fails to'engage volunteers to complete my company we would choose a few men from each company of Militia 8: the rest of the small army would be ﬁlled by the corps of the nearest place 8: by some good militiamen. I ask Your Excellency if you will be pleased to allow my brother to accompany me on this Expedition. he is‘au oﬁicer in the Department, knows all the roads & places 8: I dare say all the Indians. as he has been among them for ﬁfteen years. He is Seventy ﬁve (soixantect quinze) years in the service 8: is recommended 8: praised as a brave ofﬁcer by his superiors. I only ask Your Excellency to enquire of Major (‘arletom Mr St Luc. Colonel Camperel & Capt Frazer. as to his conduct.

PLAN OF EXPEDITION—CHANGE OF OFFICIALS 571 As there are among the people of Detroit, Niagara 8: Michilimackinac, men who could be trusted to do their duty, Your Excellency will have the goodness to send orders to the different Commandants to assist, as far as lies in their power, the good of the service. If the Expedition succeeds in taking the Illinois, then the small army will embark 8: go to reduce the Post of St Vincennes & continue its route to come to Detroit by the Wabache.

I have a very great personal regard for Colonel Caldwell, known how much he has distinguished himself in a Military Line, 8: make no doubt of his doing so —whenever he happens to be employed, but I ﬂatter myself he will consider the preference given to Lieut.

I have accepted your Bills for £17,917 1s 6%d including some Presents purchased for Indians, as my orders prohibiting such purchases had not reached your distant Quarters when that Expence was incurred. I am but too sensible that an Innovation so nearly affecting the Trader and the Indian will not fail to meet with every difﬁculty- they can mutually throw in the way, and I regret, that in doing, what I consider to be my duty to the Public, ad- ditional Trouble and disagreeable circumstances should arise to the ofﬁcers whose Lot it is to carry my views into Execution, but from the conﬁdence I have in their zeal & constancy, I ﬂatter myself that the step I have beem obliged to take, to reduce an Expense so little understood & so ill received at Home will be attended With success. - I hope you have received the Remainder of last year’s Presents from Fort Erie. A fresh supply was forwarded to you some days ago from hence, which i I hope will answer your necessities until the hurry of the Transport will ad- mit of forwarding a part of the Presents, I now look for from Home.

You must have long since have heard from the Briga- dier on that subject, and are informed how circumstances combine, to prevent my sending you that assistance I could wish, but still am inclined to think you will not have occasion for it.

FORT PITT—INVOICE OF INDIAN GOODS I579 \ if they are ﬁrm in the Resolution, and will take the Field and stick together, Mr. Clarke’s attempt must prove as fruitless as the former. He may alarm the Indians, but to penetrate to Detroit with such a Force and preparation as to insure success is hardly probable unless the Rebels were in a situation to abandon other objects of inﬁnitely greater consequence. The reasons which prevent my sending you a reinforcement from hence, equally operate against the United wishes of the Six Nations and Delawares to reduce Fort Pitt. from which object you will endeavor to dissuade them— , admitting it could be effected, it would be the business of a Campaign and when dearly purchased, we should, in our present situation, be obliged to destroy and abandon it. Should circumstances alter, it is not impossible to gratify the Indians, that I hereafter undertake it, it may not therefore be amiss that you procure au- thentic Information of the state of the works, the numbers and natures of the Guns, strength of the Garrison, &c. &c.

DEAR SIR, I have received your letter of the 23d and have in Consequence thereof ordered the few Indians present at Detroit to join you. M. Beaubin arrive here at 12 O’clock last Night from the Miamis Town whither I had sent him to get intelligence, he has brought in two Canadians from post Vin- cent whom he found there, they made no mention of an Enemy coming by the Wabash. A Speech from Le Gris assures me of the ﬁdelity of the Miamis who have sent off thirty of their Warriours to join you. I shall dispatch Beaubin this afternoon to raise the rest of the Miamis and march with them to your assistance. I also expect a large Band of Chippewas from M. Makina who shall be forwarded immediately on their arrival. The Ottawas from thence, already gone forward I hope will have join’d, as well as Captain Bradts Detachment. before Captain Caldwell ﬁnds himself under the Neces- sity of attacking the Enemy. By this Opportunity I send some provisions and ammunition to be deposited at the foot of the Rappids of the Miamis. The same Vessel proceeds to fetch. Serjt. Langdon with his Stores from San- dusky and to land them at the foot of the Rappids, from whence you are to receive your Supplies. Contrary winds have prevented my seeing Brigadier General Powell here before now. he is on his way to visit this part of his Dis- trict, as soon as he arrives I will write you again and to Captain Caldwell to whom you’ll please to show this letter, and assure him of my good wishes, in the mean time should be glad to hear from you both.

622 ‘ RELATIVE TO PROVISIONS AND TRADE ORDER CONCERNING PROVISIONS Sin, Judging it necessary for the safety of this Post, that no provisions of any kind shall remain without the Fort, but what is needed for the daily con- sumption of the People, residing here. I request that you will send a Com- missioned, two non Commissioned ofﬁcers 8: twelve Privates. six of whom are to carry their arms, to search all Magazines, Store Houses 8: Cellars, without Exception & to guard & conduct within the Fort every species of Provisions here—after described, informing the owners that they shall be placed under Lock & Key, their having access to them in the day time when necessary. Flour, Corn. & Salt meat in Barrels are the articles to which this order ex- tends. The officer will also see all the Picket Enclosures pulled down, agreeable to the intimation given in December last, to provide Post & Rail fence in their stead. Endorsed:—Copy of an order which will bring to view all the Provision purchased from the Troops in the winter at 2 sh per Pound for Pork onl . They never sell Bread—Perla: much more. The General's order respecting it will be 100 ed for early, for the reason mentioned in my letter. Traders placing :1 Dependence upon it. [B 97-2 p 575] As the Traders will not conform to Regulations Established for the last year recommended (as they were told by Major De Peyster) by His Excel- lency the Governor General, altho’ their passes oblige them to conform to such Regulations. It is not Judged necessary to stop Trade on account of the obstinacy & de- merit of the Trader. ' ’ Therefore another scheme is proposed to them to avoid the Ruin of the most unworthy— Q . Goods will be permitted to go to a certain number of Wintering Grounds, Proper People will be chosen by the Lieut. Govr. for these Places. The others must lodge their goods in the Fort under a Proper Person also chosen by the Lieut Governor and they will be permitted to take an equal quantity out \veekly, giving Bond that they will sell none but by Retail at the Post. Endorsed I—Mr Burgy will publish the within. [B 97-2 p 581]

PROVISIONS—CRUELTIES 623 sacan’ranr MATTHEWS 'ro MAJOR on PEYSTER QUEBEC 5th August 1782 Sm, His Excellency the Commander in Chief in order to diminish the .Vast Expense of all sorts of Goods and Provisions at the Post of Michili- mackinac has established Mr George McBeath at that Post in order to pro- vide those Articles for Government, at what is considered a Reasonable Proﬁt. but as he will experience every diﬂiculty in the Power of the Traders there to throw in his way particularly in the articles of Indian Corn & Grease (for which it seem there is a great Demand) I am directed to Signify to you His Excellency’s desire that you will give Him every assistance in your power, and direct as much of both as can be procured in your Neighborhood to be purchased for the Crown, which Mr McBeath will receive and account for. By some unpardonable neglect, or worse, the whole Rum in store at Mak- inac has been rendered useless. His Excellency therefore desires that you will by the ﬁrst opportunity send such supply as you can spare & you shall think necessary to carry them thro’ the winter and make a. Requisition of the Like Quantity to Niagara. I am &c. (Signed) R. Ma'r'rrmws. Major DePeyster Endorsed :—To Major DePeyster of 5th August 1782 [B 123 p 281] MAJOR DE PEYSTER TO MR. MCKEE DETROIT 6th August 1782 ‘ Sm, It having been reported to me by Isaac Zeans, that the Shawanese 8: Delawares push their retaliation to great lengths by putting all their prison- ers to death, whereby if not prevented they will throw an odium upon their . friends the English, as well as prevent their Father from receiving the neces- sary intelligence of the Enemy’s Motions, so essential to carry on the service for their mutual interests; I must therefore reiterate my injunctions to you of representing to the Chiefs that such a move of War will by no means he countenanced by their English Father, who is ever ready to assist them against the common Enemy, provided they avoid Cruelties. Tell them I shall be under the necessity of victualling the Troops (who must be tired of such scenes of Cruelty) provided they persist and assure them that the Lake Indians complain much of their late treatment to the three prisoners taken near the Falls.

624 INJUNCTION S—FALSE REPORTS I am conﬁdent, Sir, that you and the Oﬂicers do all in your power to instill humane principles into the Indians; it is however a duty incumbent on me, to beg of you once more to speak to the Chiefs and assure them that Brigadr General Powell was greatly shock’d at hearing the report spread by Zeans, and strongly recommends that it may be stopp’d, he is however still in hopes that Zeans must have greatly exaggerated Matters, as I have not received a line from you upon the Subject. Some Lake Indians who arrived from Sanguina left this two days ago, they will no doubt spread a false report that the ,Sacks, on leaving Machilimakina, fell upon their Wives 8: Children. I have already desired Captain LaMothe to assure the Chiefs that I gave no credit to it, not having then received a line‘from Lieut. Governor Sinclair. And I now have the pleasure to inform that a vessel arrived this morning, in ﬁve days from Michilimakinac, assuring me that no such thing has happen’d, but on the contrary their Wives and families were all well and desire to be particularly remembered to them—Please to' present La, Fourche and Quoio-igushkam with the annexed Belt of Friendship which they gave me at Michilimakinac, and which will now serve to convince them that their old Father speaks truth—I request to hear from you and Captain Caldwell, as soon as You receive this Letter, Craig brought me the last accounts from You dated Wakitamikee the 22nd & 23d July 1782—please to shew this letter to Captain Caldwell, to whom I shall write by the next opportunity. I am Sir Your most obedt 8: very huml Servt AT. S. DE PEYSTEB. Alexr McKee Esq I P. S. The four Belts are, one for the Hurons, Mingoes, Delawares, and. Shawanese—Should any other nations be present you will please to add accordingly. Indian Affairs M. G. III. FRO.“ BRIG. GEN. POWELL UNADDRESSED DETROIT August 7th 1782 Sm, Some letters which have lately arrived here mention that Mr. John Hay has succeeded Lieut Governor Hamilton at this Post, and as he has only the rank of Lieutenant in the army. I am convinced it will be very disagre- able to Major De Peyster (who has commanded here a long time with great ‘ credit to himself and to the satisfaction of the inhabitants in general) to serve under an ofﬁcer of that inferior rank.

CONDITION OF FORT LERNOULT 625 I therefore beg to know if it will meet with your Excellency’s approbation, should I give him leave to go down to Canada it he applys for it. I am Sir &c (signed) H. WATSON Powsnn [B 96-2 p 38] CAPTAIN BIRD 'ro BRIG.) GEN. POWELL DETROIT August 13th 1782 Sm, By this opportunity I have the honour to enclose to you the Plan of Fort Lernoult remarking (according to your desire) what Parts of the Body of the place are compleat, and what remains to be done towards putting the work in as formidable a state of defence as the nature of it will admit— Lieut. H. Duvernett (who is admirably skill’d in surveying 8: as a Draughts- man) has furnish’d the Gen] with a plan & Sketch of the Fort Town and Country Adjacent. I need not remark that the utmost extent of my abilities at Plan drawing is to explain my Ideas. The inside of Fort Lernoult as you must have observed Sir has sutfer’d nothing from the weather. From the Angle of the South Bastion to the Flag-staff Bastion is also in a. very good State. From the Flag Stalf to the Angle of the Magazine Bastion chieﬂy suﬁ'er’d by the Deluge we had here; the whole exteriour face to the thicknes of four or ﬁve feet having been wash’d into the Ditch—It is now intirely a new work to the thickness of ten feet intirely of clay, well beat and united every three foot by layers of Brush and cedar stakes, the sod being only six inches thick by way of coat. I am convinced what caused the works to sulfer so much by the violent rains was 'owing to the Sods being ﬁve or six feet thick on the face—which turning to a rich and springy loam never united properly with the clay, but was sepa- rated by the Rains and slid down. 7 The Magazine Bastion is of new work & as far as the Sally-Port on the same plan. The rest of the Fort tho’ now very defensible, becomes worse every shower and must be new faced with the same precautions. The Counterssarf Gracis & covered way are ragged, being much channel’d by the ﬂoods—which were more violent than the oldest man in the place remembers to have seen before. The Stone Magazine which was erected by the Major’s order at the fort of the Gracis, is constructed exactly from the scale of Vanbars recommended by Muller—it is on the inside 30 by 20. The arch was turned by good Eng- lish masons, and the materials prepared according to rule. The Angle of 79
Page 626
626 ‘ CONDITION OF FORT LERNOULT the Work intended for its defence is ﬂank’d on both sides by the cannon ot' the Fort, at half musket shot the plan being approved by yourself Sir & Major DePeyster is already began, as is the Gallery of Communication, which must be’a covered one, as the ground from the Stone Magazine to the Fort rises nine or ten feet. I think the enemy would suffer as much by an Assault on the Magazine work as on the Fort itself—Two guns from this work scower a hollow not commanded by the Fort—I have taken the heights round Fort Lernoult with exactness—there is no ground within eight hundred yards that is of equal height with the Terre Plein. As Fort Lernoult was originally laid down by me—I account this a favour- able opprtunity Sir of obviating some objections made to it respecting its form and size—or rather of giving some reasons why it was not form’d other- wise, and the whole larger—Late in the fall of 1778 we were alarm’d by the approach of the Enemy under one Broadhead, who with two or three thou- sand men had actually advanced as far as Tuscarawas about 90 miles from the Lake at lower Sandusky, and were employ’d in building a large Picketted Fort—Major Lernoult at a conversation with the oﬂicers at Detroit on the above alarm, concluded Detroit incapable of making a defence that might re- ﬂect honour on the Defendants, it being of great extent—only picketed—and in a manner under a hill—By his orders, on the same evening I traced a. Re- doubt on the Hill, the Plan was left to me—I at ﬁrst intended only a square (our time as we imagined being but short for fortifying ourselves) but when the square was marked out it appeared to me so naked & insuﬂicient that I added the half Bastions—imagining if the Enemy approached before the cur- tins were completed we might make a tollerable defence by. closing the Bas- tions at the Gorge—So perfect a work as one with entire Bastions for so small a number of Defendants, four or ﬁve six Pounders very ill furnish’d, and no artillery ofﬁcers—and an attack expected in a few weeks was what I never would have engaged to have undertaken. We began I think early in Nov’r and worked without intermission until Feb’y—At which time the Indians declaring an intension of attacking Col. Broadhead’s Post of 400 then at Tuscarawas, I joined them—In the mean time Lt Dnvernett return’d from Post Vincent, and was appointed Engineer —the work was then too far advanced for him to alter the form of it. Some Gentlemen who are in a manner Engineers by profession have very gravely assured me that a square or Polygon- with entire Bastions would have been a much more perfect Work than a half Bastions Fort—t0 which assur- ance I acquiess’d full as gravely. I do not Imagine Sir this Post will ever have to sustain regular attacks— but rather (it attempted at all) it will be by a large Body of men with some
Page 627
CONDITION OF FORT LERNOULT 627 Field Artillery to dismount the Cannon of our Defences and then storm the whole face of the work. The Plan I have proposed for its defence according to the best of my judgment is conformable to that Idea—and meet with Major De Peysters approbation. The detaining the Enemy a considerable time beyond the foot of the Glacis and between that and the foot of the Para- pet by means which cannot be ruin’d by the Enemies cannon I conceive to‘be the principal point of Defence for this place. The means proposed are good abbatis—small stakes drove thick in the ground 8: pointed by way of caltrops Picketts with a cuvette in front—fougasses—a cheveux de Fraize on the Berm, and fongades of small shells behind it on the faces of the Bastions— To Take our small garrison into the Body of the' Fort or from all outworks incapable of withstanding an assault as well as the Fort itself—The outwork began by Lt H. Duvernett since discontinued, being only protected by a Glacis and requiring ﬁfty or sixty men at least to defend it—might (I think) have been carried any night without much annoyance from the Fort, by an Assault in front, which was in form of a Swallow’s tail and depended entirely on its own defendants—the destruction of whom would have greatly dispirit— ed the Garrison within—Such are my reasons Sir for the form and sise of the Fort—I am less secure of those for discontinuing the out work and had not Major De Peyster approved them I would very readily have condemn’d my own opinions—as the Plan was Lt Duvernett’s. I had nearly forgot mentioning that the new raising the centirs has given me an opportunity of indenting them at the extremity at a on the plan—by which I have obtained a tollerable second ﬂank for the angle of the Bastions. I have Major De Peysters permission to mount the Brass three Pounders on low 8:. weighty ﬁeld carriages—The platform very narrow which has a false top turning on the center so as to give the gun a horrizontal Motion of ﬁfteen or twenty degrws—this top has grooves for the wheels 8: those who serve the gun using rope rammers may load under cover of the Parapet. The Enemy are by all accounts retired—I am sure it is now too late for them to advance to Detroit and by the time they will be able to advance next year, every method proposed above for the defence of this Place will be eni- ploy’i]. ~ I am with respect Sir Your most obed’t and most humble Serv’t ' A. an Capt’n 8th Reg’t Ass’ Eng’r Detroit Brig’r Gen’l Powel Endorsed z—Capt.

The Negro was examined by Mr Arundel he says his Master’s name was Epharaim Hart from whom he deserted, they lived about twenty miles up the said creek. That General Irwin [William Irvine] is mustering men at Fort Pitt to come against Sandusky, and that they are to come ﬁfteen hundr in number, they are not found in Provision by the Fort, but by the able Farmers, his master furnish’d Beef, this is what he heard at his Master’s House, where all the meetings of the country are kept and where several hundreds of that place had already given in their names to join Gen Irwin at Fort Pitt or Col’l [David] Williamson at Fort McIntosh, the Rendezvous to be held all the month of Angst and the beginning of Septr they are to set off for this place. they are not to have cannon as the Expedition is to be carried on with all the Secrecy possible, and they intend it shall be as expeditious as possible, as their intention is to kill and burn all before them. As soon as this Matter was mentioned, there was four hundred rose and said they would go to revenge the Death of Colonel Crawford. He says Hannan’s Town [Hannastown, Pa.] was burnt by some white People, and about two hundred Indians, they kill’d seven -& took nine Prisoners, they killed all the Cattle there.

I had sent messengers throughout the Indian Country previous to the re- ceipt of your Excellency’s Letter; threatening them that I would recall the- troops If they did not desist from such horrid cruelty, I have frequently sig- niﬁed to the Indians how much your Excellency abhors all acts of cruelty,— the inclosed copy of my last letter to Mr. McKee will show you that I have also made use of the Brigadier’s name and I shall to morrow dispatch a per- son I have great conﬁdence in to carry your Excellency’s fresh injunctions to the several Southern Nations. We have been alarmed here lately with the accounts of a formidable Body of the Enemy- (under the command of a Gen’l Hands) advancing this way. which occasioned my reinforcing Captain Caldwell, and sending Captain Grant to the Mouth of the Miamie with the armed vessels and Gun Boat. Our scouts now report the Enemy retired—Captain Caldwell remains Encamped on the banks of the Ohio, and Captain Grant arrived here yesterday. I have now to request as a singular favour of your Excellency, that in case Mr. John Hay is appointed Lieut. Gov’r of Detroit and is to winter here, I may be allowed to leave the place, either before, or immediately after his ar- rival, I shall ever be happy to serve my Gracious Sovereign in any station, that, under Mr. Hay excepted, for various reasons—I have already spoken to the Brigadier upon the subject, who promised me he would write to your _ Excellency for discretionary leave, which I hope will reach Niagara before this reaches Quebec.

I RELATIVE TO CRUELTIES 631 that you would recommend Humanity to the Indians, It has ever been the Principle that I have acted upon, and I am convinced that no task is more agreeable to yOur wishes. Upon my arrival here I found the Indians greatly civilized from the good advice they received from you and my Predecessors, in which disposition through our earnest Endeavors we continue them till the imprudent step of the Enemy at Muskingnm called up their Savage ferocity which I am convinced, but for the timely Interposition; would have gone to greater lengths. I see they still hold their prisoners formerly taken in mild Captivity, whilst their resentment only shows itself upon those newly taken looking upon them a a part of the People who imprudently declared by words 8: signs that they-were come to exterminate the Wyandott Tribe.

TO BRIG. GEN. POWELL . DETROIT the 27m Augst. 1782 SIR, Immediately upon receipt of your Letter of the 15th Instant, I dis- patched an Express to Captain Caldwell and Bradt, and one to Mr Alexr McKee, ordering them not to make any incursions into the Enemy’s country, but to act on the defensive only. I hope the courier will be in time to stop Captn. Bradt, who is on the point of setting out for the neighbourhood of Wheeling, but I fear Capt Caldwell has already passed the Ohio, in order to be satisﬁed of the enemies motions, in which case he will strike some stroke before he returns—my endeavours however, shall be to turn their attention towards Sandusky to which place i am informed by a deserter the Enemy are determined to march, from one thousand to ﬁfteen hundred strong. . When the deserter left them, in the beginning of this month, they were assembling in the Neighbourhood of Wheeling, and Fort McIntosh, under the command of the blood-thirsty Col. [David] Williamson who so much distinguished himself- in the Massacre of the Christian Indians, at the Settlement of Muskingum, which cruel proceedings have been the cause of the late retaliation of the Delawares, and Shaivanees, on the persons of Col. [William] Crawford, and the two Captains, and the three prisoners taken near the Fort of the Falls— By this opportunity I send down such of the Prisoners as could be con- veniently assembled—I suppose it is not intended, that the familys (mostly Germans) who have taken the Oaths, and are settled on Farms, should be included, except such of them as are desirous of going down—There are also some women, who have their children still with the Indians, who request not to leave Detroit untill their children are brought in, also some orphans, and others who do not know their Parents—these I have ﬁxed in Decent Houses, where they will be taken care of without being of the least expence to Gov- 80

But reﬂecting that your Excellency may be desirous to have Mr. Alexr. McKees original letter I herewith inclose it. I have reason to believe that Captain Caldwell conformable to my orders is at present eneamped with the Rangers and local Indians at upper Sandusky, there to wait for a body of the Enemy which I am informed are to make another attempt upon that place.

COL. HOPE AND OTHERS TO CAPTAIN ROBERTSON MICHILIMACKINAC Sept. 20th 1782 SIR, From the very heavy expences that have been incurred on account of Government at this Post, into which His Excellency the Commander in Chief has thought proper to direct us along with yourself to make Enquiry, and from the great abuses and neglect in diﬁerent shapes that have appeared to us all upon this Inquiry—the following Regulations for your future conduct in the Command of the Post will in our opinion be absolutely necessary in order to reduce 8: correct in some measure these expenses, and abuses, and you are hereby directed therefore, agreeable to the power delegated to us by His Excellency’s Instructions to that Purpose. to conform accordingly to the Regulations, as far as circumstances will possibly admit. until you receive orders to the contrary from Head Quarters—- First—That you should strictly observe the General orders of the 22nd of ' June 1781 not to make purchases and be particular in transmitting the Returns required therein, to neither of which does attention appear to have been paid, by your Predecessors, without any sufﬁcient reasons to the con- trary having been assigned or existing. Secondly—That as well as to all other Instructions and orders that have been given, You should particularly attend to the Spirit of His Excellency's Letter to Lieut. Governor Sinclair of the 10th of May 1782 to answer one of the essential purposes in which it may be found upon Trial, a good Measure to post Trusty persons on some particular passes, leading to this Place, with

REGULATIONS CONCERNING EXPENSES 639 a small quantity of Rum (when the state of that article in Store will enable you to furnish it) in order to give to the distant Indians who may be coming to the Post when not wanted, to engage them to return, to their Villages without advancing farther, the pass at St Mary’s seems a very proper one to try this experiment at— Thirdly—That you‘should be very particular in establishing some method and arrangement at the Post, both relative to the mode of issuing Provisions 8: t0 the quantity issued for a Ration in the Indian Department so as always to be able to calculate the supplies and consumption that will be necessary, as well as to have a check upon those persons who have charge of the Stores— in no part of which does there appear to have been any method—during the command of your Predecessor, which has occasioned great abuses and been the cause of a considerable part of the expense incurred unnecessarily. Fourthly—That as a sort of combination has evidently been framed by all the Traders at this Post to avail themselves of the necessity of Government, in keeping up the Price of Indian Corn, at a most exhorbitant rate, to defeat this in future, till a more reasonable & generous disposition appears among the Traders, as calculation has been made of the quantity at present wanted for the Public service, and the contractor for supplying this article should be immediately sent out to the neighbouring Villages of the Ottawa’s at L’Arbe Croche to make his purchases at the ﬁrst hands from the Indians themselves, as far as to the amount. of Two Thousand Bags before any other persons under the protection of this Post, be permitted to go out, to make theirs a measure which with any others of the same nature that may occur to yourself to adopt on a more extensive knowledge of these practices among the Traders, will we have no doubt meet with the approbation & support of the Com- mander in Chief & which therefore we strongly recommend to you— Fifthly,-that as great stress is laid by His Excellency in his Instructions upon the great increase of appointments in the Indian Department here, which has been found by us all on this Inquiry, not only to have been con-_ siderably augmented since Governor Sinclairs command of the Post but also to be without any apparent necessity in so much as that except Blondeau, who is at present with the Ottigamies—Cadet at St Mary’s.~ Rocque with the Scioux Indians & Langlade, le ﬁls as an assistant to the established Interpreter, Gautier, no other in the line of ofﬁcers or Interpretors seems to be at all requisite at this Post for the present—and these to be paid as here- tofore, at Eight Shillings p. diem each, N. York Currency, and that only a storekeeper at twelve shillings p. diem and one Blacksmith at eight Shillings N. York Curry are necessary to be added to the above list, to which latter appointment your own nomination of the properest persons to be

640 REGULATIONS CONCERNING EXPENSES found upon the principles expressed in the Generals Instructions is thought right. You, are therefore hereby directed to strike off from this period all others of whatever denomination, that may be paid on the list of the Indian Department, until the Commander in Chief’s further pleasure shall be signi- ﬁed to you upon this subject. Siethly,—that as an Engineer will be left to carry on the Works, You are hereby directed to discontinue all the appointments as they stand at present in that Line, and only to pay such in future, as he will point out, at the usual rates, and that you shall think absolutely necessary to carry on the serviceL-that all those useless ofﬁcers under the denomination of Naval Department. be likewise immediately abolished, and that a. stop be put to working at the Vessel on the Rocks, 8: the people now employed on it be dis- missed, as soon as the present materials collected are used, or that the Bulk of it is ﬁnished— . Seventhly,—that the small vessel which has been taken into the hire of Gov- ernment by your Predecessor at such an Enormous rate, and contrary to the lenerals regulation on this subject, should be 8: is, hereby directed to be paid off at the expiration of another month & be sent away to Detroit, the con- tinuance of her in the Service for that period being allowed only on account of the assistance agree’d to be given to the Contractor for collecting his Corn to the Post on this occasion, and as she may also be of use in the exertion so necessary at present towards compleating the works, on the proposed teln- porary plan— From an adherence to these Regulations, which we think highly necessary just now for the Service, and from the Zeal, with which we are convinced that you will carry them into execution, as well as every other measure that shall appear to you, condusive to that end, the most sanguine hopes may be entertained of a very material reduction so justly complained of at this Post.

642 CONDITION OF FORT MICHILIMACKINIC CONDITION OF FORT MICHILIMACKINAC.‘ Report of the state 8: Condition of the Works of Fort Michilimackinac at- tended with a plan of what is thought necessary to put it into a state of De- fence, before the Winter, as will prevent its being taken by surprize— The Fort is situated at the South end of the Island of Michilimackinac on an eminence, about half a mile from tlle'shore, and about one Hundred & Fifty feet above the level of the Lake fronting a small Bay. 7 The Fort is irregular in its construction built of masonry & timber work, but as no part of it is in a proper state of defence against a surprize, it will be necessary to examine the Lines that form the Fort separately, in order to shew what ought immediately to be done, to render every part secure A—vide plan. This Line forms the South front of the Fort, close to the edge of a steep hill. and has a Parapet of Timber one foot thick, and 4 ft, 6 in high, supported by a wall of masonry Thirty three feet of this Line on the right is a dry stone wall, four feet high, on a mean from the ground—but without any Parapet—I would propose to raise it six feet higher and plant pickets on the top of it, about three inches as under, of a proper length, be- hind which should be made a small Banquette—- The left of this Line opposite the Guard House should be picketted to the entrance into the Fort—mud the opening left for the gatewayﬁshould have a strong Barrier Gate—and traversed in the rear, so as to Join the termination of the Line, which for' about Twenty feet is part timber work on the top of which a Stone wall is built. This wall I would propose to raise about ﬁve feet, plant picketts thereon and form a Banquette behind— B—This line forms a small Flank to C, but being only a wall about three feet above the ground, it should be raised to six feet 8: picketed on the top with a Banquette. The Hill in front is so very steep that nothing further appears requisite—except it might be thought necessary to lay a few Abbatis in front and close to the edge of the Hill to render the Access more difﬁcult. C—This Line is a stone wall about three feet high above the ground. I would propose to raise it to about eight feet high 8: ﬁnish it in the same man- ner as the Line 3. D—This Line for one Hundred and ﬁfty eight feet is of stone, but raised little or nothing above the ground. I would raise it at least ten feet, & on the top plant Picketts, and form a Banquette behind. A quantity of stone is quarried on the top, in forming a Ditch to this Line, which may be used in raising ground in front of this Line, & I would scalp the rising ground in front of this Line, of as much earth as possible to form a Banquette behind. *[As‘the lettering A. B. C., &c. corresponding to that of the report was lackin in the diagram as received from the copyists, it has been supplied as seemed most obvious.— d.]
Page 643
CONDITION OF FORT MICHILIMACKINAC 643 the picketing also lay an Abbittis on' this ground, so as to be ﬂanked by the Line E, and indeed if Time permitted it would be proper to raise the Line D even fourteen feet, that the Provision Store may be properly covered, but also to prevent a part of the work being seen in reverse—About thirty two feet and nearly in the continuation of this Line, the Line is constructed of logs at A, but has no Parapet—If thought necessary a picketting may be ﬁxed on it, and a Banquette formed behind. E-—This Line is constructed of Log work ﬁlled in with earth, within three feet of the level of the rampart, & its height from 12 to 14 feet above the bottom of the Ditch. I would propose to ﬁll in the Timber-work with earth, even with the level, and plant a picketting on the top—Part of the Timber- work of the Parapet of this Line is formed at b, which I would also ﬁll in, to the height of about four feet, above the rampart, so as to have as- great com- mand as possible on the rising ground before it. Two embrasures are formed on this Line. The wood in front of the Line should be felled to the distance of ﬁve Hundred yards, so as not to afford any cover to an enemy. F—This Line is formed of Log-work ﬁlled with earth, level with the Ram- part—one merlon is formed, but not ﬁlled. The Height of the work above the ground is from eight to twelve feet. the Breadth of the Ditch from ten to thirty feet wide. It will be necessary, the narrow part of the Ditch should be widened, 8: pickets placed on the Rampart, where the work is low, & par- ticular attention will be requisite to secure the dead Angles, by widening & sinking the Ditch opposite to them—s0 as not to leave any footing for an enemy. G—This Line is a Stone \Vall, about ﬁve feet wide at top—The height of the wall is from 8 to 16 feet above the ground. 'The Ditch in Front is roughly excavated from 20 to 23 feet wide. and sunk below the Level ground fr0m_6 to 10 feet. I would propose to slope the ground at the foot of the IVall, and throw the earth into the work to form a Banquette to the Pickett- ing that is necessary to be placed where the wall is low, part of the Rampart to this Line is formed. H—This Line is similar to G, its height above the ground is from 6 to 13 feet and the Ditch is sunk about four feet lower. The same alteration here will be necessary as to the Line G. I—This Line is formed of Log-work and the Parapet nearly ﬁnished. There are two Embrasures on this Line. I would slope the Ground at the Foot of the scarf, and trim the ground taken out of the Ditch more in Glacis, to prevent an enemy lodging under cover of it, which at present may be easily done—The height of the work is from 9 to 11 feet above the ground. The Ditch is from 20 to 40 feet broad, and three feet below the level ground, but
Page 644
644 CONDITION OF FORT MlCHILIMACKINAC roughly traced. The ends of the Land-ties projecting from the work should be cut off, The entering angles formed by H I should be dug deeper, at least 5 feet, and the Stone wall raised about four feet, where it joined the Line I for the length of 30 feet on the Line H atthe right and left extrem- ity of this Line the Salient Ahgles are raised, on which are placed four wall pieces that have a tolerable command over the ground in front. K—This Line is formed of Log-work and the parapet raised about four .feet high above the Rampart, but not ﬁlled in, this should be done. The Height of the work is from 10 to 16 feet and the Ditch about 30 feet broad but roughly dug. The Rubbish taken out of the Ditch should be trimmed more in glacis, from the work as observed before to prevent an_ enemy lodging in the hollow way in front. The parapet should be ﬁlled in and a Banquette made behind it. ' L—This Line is a Stone wall, as high as the Level of the rampart. in height about 13'feet above the ground, on which a Log Parapet is partly framed. but not ﬁlled in, this should be done, and a picketting made behind it with a Banquette. The Ditch to the Line is dug about 16 feet broad. The would should be cut down to at least 500 yards back, that the rising ground opposite may be exposed as much as possible. M—This Line is a Stone wall from 12 to 18 feet high. It is not material whether it is picketted, except about 20 feet from the re-entering Angle d, but, the Trees should be felled down, the Slopes of the Hill. N—This Line is a Stone Wall and forms a Flank to M. It’s height from 9 to‘12 feet at the Salient Angle I would have the rocky_ Bluff lowered or have pickets planted on the Wall, and the planks laid to form a Banquette. O—This Line is a Stone Wall, about 6 feet'high, as it is the only Flank to the Road leading up to the Fort, 8; to the long Line A. I would raise the wall about 4 feet higher, to give it a greater command a ﬁx a picketting with a Banquette behind. As the Slope of the Hill here is very steep and enemy would ﬁnd it_ Difﬁcult to break in at this Quarter. 0.. B. S—Two Flanks and a curtain of framed Log-work of unequal heights. which is now taking down, this From in my opinion, is well constructed 8: forms a better Defence than any other part of the work. The (Faces of the Demi-Bastions would have been properly defended if the work G. H. had not joined the shoulders, however, I think the Curtain and Flanks Q. R. S. should remain, and if time permitted would picket them, but as the Timber work of the Curtain has not been ﬁlled in with earth, I would lay Planks to serve as a Banquette. This will increase the Defence. by serving as an entrenchment to the work before it.

. FORT—REMOVAL 'OF'LIEUT. GOV. SINCLAIR 645 Gates ought to be made to the two Gate-ways which also should be trav- ersed. From the great Extent of the Lines of Defence, it appears the present Gar- rison is not sufﬁcient for the defence of such a Fort, & from the great irreg- ularity of the works, & being incompleat in so many places, it does not ap- pear to me at this time possible to contract ’it, without exposing some parts to be surprised—It must therefore be secured on its Present Plan, and, would about one Hundred men be furnished as Labourers (exclusive of the different artiﬁcers) I am induced to think with a proper exertion that in about two months, the works might be put into such a state as to be secure against a surprize. For this purpose every kind of Timber and Plank should be immediately collected & brought to the Fort, without loss of time, to strengthen the Place when requisite. . ' Reported by (signed) R.

The Party who sent him consists of seventy men who he says will push to be in before the Enemy. they' attacked a small Fort between Wheeling and Beaver Creek, but were unsuccessful and lost two men. Capt. Bradt is just arriv’d here likewise with the Rangers 8: a. few Delawares. ‘ I shall assemble all the Indians that can be found in this Quarter to oppose them. I wish the Hurons now to watch towards Koashawking & inform us of their discoveries from time to time perhaps upper Sandusky is their object. this only can be known by the way they take from Kooshoking or Tuskarawas.

AFFAIRS AT DETROIT—CROPS . 647 MAJOR DE PEYSTER TO GENERAL MALDIMAND Ds'raon the 26th Sepr 1782. Sm, I am honoured with your Excellency”s Commands to send all the corn this Settlement can spare to the Post of Michilimackinac. When there is any to spare I shall not fail to do it, but I must beg leave to observe that, when we have an Expedition on foot in the Indian country, the Settlement barely produces what is necessary. From the constant imployment we have had for our artiﬁcers and labourers, in order to put this place in a state of security, it has not been in my power to Erect a Mill, upon Hog Island. which no doubt Your Excellency has been informed of by Brigadier General Powell. The wheat raised this year, does not however, require much grinding owing to the Violent falls of rain, and, to the Indian Horses swimming around or breaking the Fences—The Quantity of Indian. Corn raised amounts to about Eight Hundred Bushels which requires no grinding, and as the soil is better calculatedfor it, than for wheat, I shall humbly offer my opinion to give up the Cultivation of the latter, at least for the present, and stick to the raising of Indian Corn, and grazing of Cattle, for which the Islan is best calculated, the inconveniency of the Indian Horses excepted, which will ever be a plague, I shall therefore wait Your Excellency‘s further determination before I proceed to erect a Mill, which I now see will be more expensive than useful.

650 CONTINGENCIES—POLICY them. Lt. Colonel Hope took with him the Intelligence I received from the Indian country the day he left Detroit, and will before this reaches Quebec, have informed your Excellency of the steps I have taken in consequence thereof. Should the rangers be obliged to retreat, (which from the sickness among them may be very probable) or should Mr. Clarke from the other Qliarter, push the Shawanesse, Captain Potts will be well situated to cover their retreat, till they can be reinforced from all Quarters. I have a very diﬂicnlt Card to play at this post, and its dependencies, which differs widely from the situation of aﬂt'airs at Michilimackinac, Niagara and others in the upper district of Canada. It is evident that the back settlers will continue to make war upon the Shawneese, Delawares 8: Wiandotts even after a truce shall be agreed to betwixt Great Britain and Her Revolted Colonies. In which case, whilst we continue to support the Indians, with troops (which they are calling aloud for) or only witlu arms, ammunition and necessarys, we shall incur the odium of encouraging incursions into the back Settlements —for, it is as evident, that, when the Indians are on foot occasioned by the constant alarms they receive from the Enemys entering their country. they will occasionally enter the settlements, and bring off Prisoners. and Scalps— so, that whilst in alliance with a people we are bound to support, a Defensive war, will in spite of human prudence, almost always terminate'in an oﬁensive one— - ' These' matters considered I hope your Excellency will urge the necessity of the back Settlers holding out the olive branch, instead of setting on foot. one expedition after another—declaring on their setting out. that their inten- tions are to exterminate the whole Savage tribe. I wait with impatience to hear from your Excellency, and in the meantime I shall continue to discour- age smal-l partys as much as possible, and endeavour in every respect to act for the honor of the British nation.

DEAR Sm, I am favoured with your letter of the 22d and 26th Ultimo, by which the Enemy seem inclined to cut off the Huron and Shawanee Villages. By the accounts of their force in the present sickly state of the Rangers and the Indians being so much distressed I fear you will be obliged to retreat at least till you are joined by the Miamies. I have sent all the Indians I could ' muster particularly the Ottawas of the Miamie Riv’r. igoushwa is also gone, ‘ and eight of the six Nations which arrived here in the last Vessels. You must be sensible that my soldiers are little acquainted with wood ﬁghting and Ill equipped for it withall. I~had therefore only ordered themnto take post where they can secure the ammunition and provisions and support you in case you are obliged to retreat which I hope will still not be the case. If the Indians are as determined as they have hitherto shown themselves. I am very unwell and have an ugly bruised thumb which will I hope apol- ogize for the brevity of this Letter.

652 AFFAIRS OF LIEUT GOV. HAY few days ago, and am extremely sorry, that your being responsible for the consequences of any change at Detroit, should oblige your Excellency not to permit me to proceed there this season. The disappointment is the greater as your Excellency always gave me rea- son to believe I should repair to the post assigned me, from my ﬁrst arrival at Quebec in the latter end of June, but since your Excellency has resolved to the contrary, my duty obliges me to comply with it, tho’ not the less mor- tiﬁed. The article of House rent which your Excellency has made me an allowance for, and which you hope is the only inconvenience attending my being detained here, is the least of several. Your Excellency I presume is not ignorant that I left a numerous family, and went voluntarily upon a disagreeable and unpromising service, fell into the hands of the Enemy, suﬁered a long conﬁnement in prisons & Dungeon! received many indignitys, put to exhorbitaut expences during an absence of four years. and ﬁnally laid down ﬁfteen shillings pr. day on a presumption of entering into employ: instead of which I see another enjoy in quiet the Emolument's annexed to my appointment and seven shillings & six pence pr. day besides. This will appear very strange to the person from whom I had the honor of receiving my commission: but as my reputation is at stake in several views. it will be incumbent on me to make it appear I suffer innocently after volun- tarily: and that what was meant, given and received as a Reward, is (if I am to be thus suspended from my ofﬁce) turn'd to a pecuniary and degrading punishment. .

656 NAVIGATION TO THE UPPER COUNTRY LlEL'T. COL. HOPE TO GENERAL HALDIMAND QUEBEC, Octr. 19th 1782. Sm.—In obedience to your Excelleucy‘s Commands of the 15th of August last, I set out from Quebec on the following day, from Montreal on the 21st of the same month. 8: arrived at Michilimackinac by way of the Grand River on the lfith September, the twenty-fourth day from our leaving the Indian Village of Canesadago, having had the winds upon Lake Huron so strong as to oblige our canoe to lay by three entire days—on the subject of this very intricate navigation I shall not take up more of your Excellency‘s time at present than just to mention the several distances of the principal points on it with the number of carrying places only in each, where the“ Canoes with the Provisions and the. Baggage of the Party were oblig’d to be transported by themselves, the particulars of which are as follows, viz. up the Grand River from (,‘ausedago & Matonan (where we quitted it) 117 leagues with 16 I’ortages, up the little River to the entrance of Lake Nipipin 18 leagues with 15 l'ortages—Across that Lake 12 leagues—Down the French River :35 Leagues with 3 Carrying Places, & across Lake Huron to the Island of Michilimackinac 79 Leagues, the~whole making 251 Leagues with 34 Carrying P'laces, after which when I observe to your Excellency that the shallowness of the water 8: rapidity of the current in these Rivers are such as to render it absolutely impossible to navigate them in any other craft but Bark Canoes, it is of course unnecessary almost to add that this communica- tion can serve no other Military purpose than to forward expresses to the upper country, or perhaps to throw a very small reinforcement of men into either of the Posts of Michilimackinac or Detroit upon emergency, _in case of any part of the other by the Lakes being intercepted for a time. With respect to the business which Your Excellency gave me in charge along with Sir John Johnson and the other Gentlemen “of enquiring into the cause of the great expenses that had been incurred of late at Michilimackinac, and to apply such temporary remedies to the different abuses that might appear as were most expedient.” I beg leave to refer your Excellency to our joint report upon that head which I have already had the honour to give in. As to the state in which I found the works at that Post, and the steps that appeared to me most proper to be taken with respect to them under present circumstances, the Engineer Dr. Hocking’s report (whom Your Excelly. sent up with me for that purpose) will fully explain the former, as will the order I left with him 8: Captain Robertson shew the latter, much more might be said upon the subject of every branch of service, such as I found them at this Post. than can come within the compass of a General Report of this nature—
Page 657
_EVENTS OF THE JOURNEY . 657 but having taken minutes upon every thing that struck me at the time—I can at any future period dwell upon such particular points as Your Excel- lency may think sufﬁciently interesting to engage your attention—so shall only further observe at present with respect to Michilimackinac. that as from the returns which I received there of what was actually arrived, and from the state of the transportihat was going on, there will probably be in the stores by the time the navigation of the Lakes is closed this year an entire twelve months Provision of all species (8: more of some) so from the resources of ﬁsh which they have at hand in great plenty. 8: of Indian Corn that might be collected from the Indian Villages in the neighborhood, that Garrison should be able to support itself in case of any impediment to farther supply next season till the navigation shall be open in the following Spring— On the 21st Sept. as soon as the business at Michillimackinac was ﬁnished, 1 embark’d in one of the King’s Sloops employed on that communication for Detroit. and arriv’d there late at night of the 24th, the Distance being 106 Leagues. But from the strength of the Current 8: a Bar, which there is in the narrows between the Lakes St. Claire & Huron. and which requires a strong leading ‘wind to pass it, this voyage upwards is seldom made in less- than ten or twelve days—Here I remained only till the Evening of the 26th of Sepr. having in that time inspected the state of the Garrison and of the Diﬁ'erent Departments at this Post, agreeable to Your Excellency"s Direc_ tions. But tho’ I have furnished myself with every Information that was required, yet as Brigadier General Powell had so immediately preceeded me and is since come down from those Posts. who will have been able to make Reports to Your Excellency upon all these points in the fullest manner, it becomes unnecessary for me to trouble Your Excellency with an imperfect repitition, however on any particular branches you may do me the honor in future to demand my opinion, I shall ever be ready to give it with every information that I have gained to the best of my judgment— Tho it was so early as the ﬁrst of October that I reach’d Niagara, having traversed Lake Erie 8: Examined the condition, terms 8: mode of transport across that important carrying Place in the course of ﬁve days, yet no vessel being then on that side of Lake Ontario. or arriving till the 3rd Inst, and the weather being too boisterous to attempt the passage in a. Boat, it was not till the 6th in the morning that I sailed from hence, with the full intention however of calling at Oswego, and according to Your Excellericy‘s Instruc- tions of visiting that Post, but after beating against contrary winds four en- tire days within sight of Niagara. and a Southerly wind then springing up, when we were upon the North 'Shore of the Lake, it was with much regret, that I was obliged to relinquish that object & to steer for Carleton Island, 83
Page 658
658 I I EVENTS OF THE JOURNEYwDAMAGE where we did not arrive till the 11th and as the time prescrib’d for my being here was then drawing on apace, I embark’d in a Bateau next morning and after visiting the post of Oswegatchie, 8: seeing those very ingenious 8: use- full cuts and Canals that have been made to facilitate the navigation up these amazing Rapids at Coteau du Lac and some other adjacent spots, the Current brought me down to Montreal, in something more than 48 Hours, tho’ a Dis- tance of near seventy Leagues—and which to ascend with loaded Bateaux even in the longest days of the summer season seldom takes less. I am given to understand, than fourteen days, and at this time of the year nearer twenty. For the same reason assign’d already with regard to detroit. if Brigadier Powell’s having so lately also left Niagara, and seen the State of the lower Posts, its is equally useless for me to take up your Excellency’s time just now with particulars relative to them, as they must only be a repitition— And as the Indian Department upon the very extensive communication when Your Excellency considers the magnitude of the object and the variety of matter for enquiry, it will occur that a much longer time than I could command at this advanced season, in the prosecution of a Tour of Two Thou- sand miles and upwards such as what I have made within two months—would have been requisite to gain that competent knowledge to report as fully to Your Excellency as it would appear that the subject requires, some notes how- ever I have taken which I shall endeavor to digest into a sort of form which may aid a little in any future investigations, in the meantime from the pains which Sir John Johnson has taken, at the several Posts on this Tour that we have made together, to inform himself thoroughly of the various abuses that it is so apparent have crept into this Department, not only from the extra- ordinary number of appointments in it, but with respect to the vast ex- penses that the present mode of cloathing & feeding Indians leaves an infal- lible opening for, and indeed to.make himself perfect master of the subject, ' I have no doubt but that Your Excellency will receive every satisfaction on this head that you could wish from him— There is only one matter more then of the several subjects pointed out to me by Your Excellency’s order to report upon, that I think necessary to in; trude upon any more of your time will in this manner (being ready however as I have before observ’d to discuss the particulars of them all when your leisure will admit, as far as every Information that I have collected can go) but this subject it is highly proper that Your Excellency should be inform’d of, which is, that complaints are made at all the Posts from Carleton Island upwards that great quantities of the Pork 8: Pease arrive to them in so damag‘d a state as even to be unﬁt for present use (one instance of which I was myself witness to in part of a Cargo that came to Michilimackinac during

DAMAGE TO PROI'ISIONS;HOSTILITIES 659 my stay there, owing it appeared to the badness 0f the Casks, that had left the Pork to corrupt in a Dry State—that the waste of these articles is not the only consideration, great as it is but the consequences of disappointment in the quantity of Provisions depended upon might as Your Excellency well knows be of a most serious nature—Now tho’ from every enquiry into the subject, I am far from thinking that the whole damage accrues on the trans- portation, but that on the contrary there must have been some want of atten- tion to the state in which these Provisions are set forward from La Chine, yet certainly a part may have been occasioned by some defects on certain parts of this communication that can I should conceive be easily guarded against before the ensuing season for the transport begins. and which, as this subject is so immediately connected with the Department in which Your Excel- lency has done me the honour to appoint me to act, I shall think it more indispensible a Duty hereafter to submit to your consideration. It in these endeavors to execute Your Excellency’s orders I may have the good fortune in the smallest degree to have succeeded to your approbation, permit me to add that every fatigue and pains will be amply repaid, having the honour, Sir, to subscribe myself with the greatest respect.

From an apprehension, Sir, that the Disposition of the Indians, and the indispensible necessity of preserving their aﬁections may not be Sufﬁciently understood at Home, I,think it my duty to assure you that an unremitting attention to a very nice management of that People is inseparable from the safety of this Province, which has been indisputably preserved hitherto in a: great measure by their Attachment. They must not be considered subject to Orders or easily inﬂuenced where their Interests or Resentments are con- cerned. Great Pains 8: Treasure were bestowed to bring them to _act.

Foreseeing the Possibility of the Americans becoming an Independent Powerful People and retaliating Severely upon them, they reproach us with their Rain, and while their Fears are thus alive, if the Americans are disposed to take the advantage of them, and are in a Situation to supply their wants liberally, The consequences may be very fatal. As long as the Six Nations are determined to act with us.

The Expense attending our Indian Alliance is enormous it originated in the diﬂiculty & necessity of bringing them to Act, and perhaps in some measure, in bad Management: but the present is not the time to Retrench, for they must be liberally supplied while we have occasion for their services—nor should they be forgotten afterwards—Interest, Humanity & Gratitude are concerned in granting them a yearly gratuity for their Services—That Establishment, when a Peace takes Place may be reduced to such Limits as to render a Bounty so well bestowed, of little

PUBLIC AFFAIRS—ASYLUM 667 GENERAL HALDIMAXD TO HON. THOMAS '1'O\\'XSHE.\‘D “ Private." QUEBEC 20th Octr 1782 i, The Right Honble Thomas Townshc-nd 8111, The present situation of Public affairs is such as necessarily employs the thoughts 8: attention of every person who has the honor to be employed by His Majesty, or who feels himself interested for the welfare of his Kingdom. ‘ Equally sensible of your Friendship to myself, as persuaded of your attach- ment to the service of the King—I write this letter for your private Informa- tion, having an entire Conﬁdence in the Indulgence with which you will receive any suggestions or Hints, which may be improved to the beneﬁt of your Country—- The Evacuation of the Posts which has already taken, or which, may hereafter take place in the Provinces bordering upon the Atlantic, has engaged some Loyalists to seek an Asylum in this country— I have great rea- son to think that many more will t'ol‘low their Example in hopes of getting Grants of Land here to compensate for those which they have forfeited in their own Country by their Loyalty to the King. The unconceded Lands in this country are unfortunately of little value not improveable, not being fertile in themselves and at a great distance from the River St Lawrence. I am assured by the Loyalists that in case New York is evacuated a very great number of Families who have taken refuge there at Different Periods of the War, will be obliged to seek an Asylum in Nova Scotia or Canada—The situation of these people Excites Compassion and requires every assistance which Government can afford them. In conversing with Major Holland who surveyed Cape Breton in the year 1776, it has occured to me that an Estab- lihment might be procured for these unfortunate People on that Island, which in a few years would become comfortable to themselves, as well as beneﬁcial to the Mother Country. The Island contains a great Quantity of improveable Land, as well as many valuable Harbors & Stations for Fisheries. Its proximity to New- foundland, the Island of St John’s & Gulf of St. Lawrence is such that the Fleet or Cruizers necessary for its Defence, will be equally usefull for the Pro- tection of the Trade carried on at these Places, but as Major Holland trans- mitted in a plan of Cape Breton to the Board of Trade. you will be able to form a better opinion from the Plan, of the advantages of situation, than from any Description which I can give. It may be presumed that these Peo- ple having suffered so much Persecution for their attachment to the Crown
Page 668
668 CAPE BRETON AS AN ASYLUM of Great Britain,'will transmit the same to their Posterity—Iu case Govern- ment should approve this idea, Cape Breton may be made an Asylum for the Refugees from the Sea Coasts of the Northern Provinces. There are already in this Province many Loyalists, and no doubt many more will soon arrive, from‘the Frontiers of New England 8: New York, perhaps an Establishment may be procured for them, at, or near Detroit. The Lands there are fertile & can be cultivated with ease. The climate is in every respect advantageous. A settlement of men at that place who by Principle and a sense of sufferings, are attached _to Great Britain will be a great support to our Indian Allies. who have everything to fear from the encroachments of the Americans. Besides such settlement would in a few years raise a quantity of Provisions suﬁicient for the Garrisons, which it will be necessary to keep in the Upper Countries & might prove an essential resource in case at any future period the communication between the Upper & the Lower Canada should be so far interrupted as the supplies of Proviions could not be sent from the latter. The settlement ought to all intents add'Pui-poses to be under Military Gov- ernment. The ofﬁcer appointed to that command should have at least the Rank of Lieut. Colonel in the Army. The Lieut Governor of Detroit is at present Mr. Hay. whose Rank in the Army is that of Lieutenant, his appoint— ment of Major of Militia by Captain Hamilton at that time Lieut Governor of Detroit, giving him no Rank in the Army. Tho’ I have no objection to Mr. Hay, yet that circumstance has put me under the‘necessity to detain him this winter at Montreal, as his taking the command from Major de Peyster at the. time when the Enemy tho’ repulsed in two actions, persist in their attempts against the Indian Country, might be' attended with great inconvenience to the Service. Major de Peyster from having commanded ,there for some years is well acquainted with the nature & resources of the Service, & has acquired great Inﬂuence with the Indians. Tho’ his zeal & Duty for the service might induce Major de Peyster to serve if ordered to remain at Detroit under the command of Lieut. Gov. Hay, yet that is a mortiﬁcation which in the pres- ent state of things I think improper in me to impose upon so deserving an oﬁicer. In case a Peace or Truce should take place during the winter, tho’ I appre- ‘hend it is unnecessary, yet my anxiety for the good of the Empire makes me observe to you that in making the one or the other, great care should be taken that Niagara & Oswego should be annexed to Canada, or comprehended in the general words. that each of the contending Parties in North America should retain what they possessed at the time. The Posession of these two Forts is essentially necessary to the security as well as the Trade of the

APPENDIX VOLUME X—SECOND EDITION. The pages to which the notes refer are indicated by the numbers in the margin. 54. 86. 211. 216. 225. The statements of this paragraph are incorrect; the writer seems to have had the Northwest Territory in mind, but his conception of its extent and location is also at fault. That part of the country, now known as Colorado and Nebraska, were never part of Michigan; the author, however, could have included with- out error, the eastern parts of North and South Dakota. The following is a very brief outline of Michigan’s geographical history, condensed from Campbell’s Political History of Michigan: Wayne county was established in 1796, by Winthrop Sargent, who was the acting governor of the Northwest Territory; it included all of what later became the Territory at Michigan as well as part of Ohio and Indiana. In 1800 Congress passed an act which threw into Indiana Territory all of what is now Michigan, except the eastern (about) half of the Lower Peninsula. In 1802 Congress authorized the people east of Indiana and south of a line drawn eastward from the south point of Lake Michigan, to adopt a c0nstitnti0n,-—all north of this line to be annexed to Indiana. In 1805 Congress enacted—“All that part of Indiana Territory which lies north of a line drawn east from the southerly bend or extreme of Lake Michigan, until it shall intersect Lake Erie, and east of a line drawn from the said southerly bend through the middle of said lake to its northern extremity, and thence due north to the northern boundary of the United States, shall for the purpose of temporary government, constitute a. separate Territory, and be called Michigan." In 1816 Congress authorized the establishment of the State of Indiana, ﬁxing its north boundary ten miles north of the extreme south end of Lake Michigan. In 1818 Illinois was admitted to the Union with its north boundary at 42° 30', and all the country to the north lying east of the Mississippi made a part of the Territory of Michigan. In 1834 all the territory west of the Mississippi river, north of the State of Missouri, and east of the Missouri river and White Earth river was added to Michigan. In June, 1836, congress passed an act providing for the admission of Michigan to the union with boundaries as they now are, that is, with the western part of the Upper Peninsula added, and the “Toledo strip" taken away from the original Michigan of 1805. A new chapter of the history of Michigan's boundaries must soon be written, as recent surveys show that Wisconsin is exercising jurisdiction over land that the Act of 1836 gave to the Upper Peninsula. This reverend gentleman at that time claimed only a humble origin, but later became the hero of a. romance which gave to him loyal lineage, in fact, made him the kidnapped Dauphin and heir to the Bourbon throne. _ On July 27th, Andrew (Andre) entered the Fort at Detroit to assure Major Gladwin of his loyalty to the British,—see page 337, Vol. VIII. Louis St. Ange de Bellerive was the ﬁrst British governor of Illinois; he re- lieved Neyou de Villiers from the command of Fort Chartres in June, 1764. He was with Charlevoix in his exploring expedition and died in St. Louis in 1774. (Ill. and La... under French Rule, Wallace.) Robert Rogers was born in New Hampshire in 1727 and died in London in 1800. He was a daring and successful leader of New Hampshire Militia in the campaigns about Lake George against the French. After the fall of Quebec in 1760, he received the surrender of the Northwestern French forts. After escaping on a technicality from the investigation here narrated, he went to England, where he appears as an author and a prisoner for debt. 85

When the War of Independence began he offered his services to Congress, but his sincerity was suspected and he was put under arrest, and then released upon parole, which be promptly broke by accepting a British colonel’s commission and raising a regiment. It may be safely assumed that there never was a place on the Mississippi called Louis Constant; it is undoubtedly an error of the copyist. either in London or Ottawa. The best way for the deserters to have gone to Louisiana would have been by the way of the Wisconsin river, and with a little change in spelling and capitalization we have L'Ouiscons'in. In Vol. VII, of "Documents relating to the Colonial History of the State of New York, it is spelled “Lowis Constant." Frederick Christopher Spiesmacher was appointed Lieutenant in the Sixtieth or Royal American Regiment in 1756, while a prisoner of war in France. In 1770 he was promoted to a Captaincy and received his majority in 1778. His command went to the West Indies in 1772, where it is supposed he died in 1782. (J. R. Broadhead, Ed. of Colonial Documents of N. Y.—Vol. VII.) William Hay came to Canada with Gov. Guy Carleton in 1776 as Chief justice; he was succeeded by Peter Livius, a refugee from New Hampshire, in about 1779. ' - There was a Miami chief called Piedfroid, so we may safely conclude this should be Cold Feet. See "Maumee River Basin," (Slocum). from which most. of the modern names here inserted were taken. Parkman quotes a letter from Raymond, who commanded at Miami under the French, to the effect that certain news brought in by “Cold Foot" might be relied upon as he was an honest man if any Indian could be said to possess such virtue. It is difficult to determine the route here described. Several rivers have been called Huron, notably the Clinton and the Cass, besides the modern Huron. The Savoyard had also been called the Little Huron. The Clinton and the modern Huron are about equidistant. but not nearly so far as forty miles from Detroit. Perhaps it was the Raisin. The “Receanamozo” is undoubtedly the Ke Kalamazoo. A. L. Williams is authority for the following Indian names of rivers: Raisin, Nee-ma Sebee; Huron, 008 seat ee nong Sebee: Clinton, Not e way Sebee. Alexander McKee was a native of Pennsylvania, and in the British service became an Indian agent with the rank of colonel and was very active in setting the Indians on the Americans—at least up to 1813. In April, 1778, John Proctor wrote to President Wharton: “Sir, I am able to inform you that Capt. ' Alexander McKee with sevin other Vilons is gen to the Indians, and since there is a serj’t and twenty od men gon from Pittsburg of the Soldiers." (Penna. Archives.) Among the “sevin other vilons" were Simon Girty, Matthew Eliott, and Robert Surphlet. The name of John Campbell appears among those who received land in Clark's grant, and as he received only 108 acres he must have been a. private, as ofﬁcers received more in accordance with their rank. John Schank (born 1741, died 1823) had charge of the British vessels on the great'lakes. It was he who built the lnﬂexible that defeated the American ﬂeet on Lake Champlain, and made the bridges for Burgoyne's expedition. In 1822 he was appointed admiral. Augustin Molin de la Balme claimed to have been a French Lieutenant Colonel and to have come to America with Lafayette. He enlisted about forty-ﬁve men at Kaskaskia and Cahokia and picked up a few more at Vincennes. it was at modern Ft. Wayne that his little band was nearly annihilated by the Miamis under Chief Little Turtle. (History of Maumee Basin, Slocum.) Both Moore, in his “The Northwest under three Flags," and Parrish in his "Historic Illinois," as well as several historians. state that the expedition against St. Joseph. headed by Thomas Brady and Jean Baptiste Hamlin, took place in October, 1777. Both these authorities say that the Spanish expedition sent out by Gov. Cruvat left St. Louis in January, 1781, and returned in March of that year, and of this there can be no doubt, as there is ample documentary evidence at St. Louis and Madrid. Don Eugenio Pourre was the commander with Don Carlos Tayon for his lieutenant. Under their command were about sixty-ﬁve Spaniards and Frenchmen and as many Indians. The news of their return with the British flag from Fort St. Joseph was printed

451. 482. 512. 547. 574. 635. 652. APPENDIX 675 in European papers in March, 1782 (note the. perhaps intentional delay), and caused quite a stir in diplomatic circles, particularly attracting the atten- tion of the American representatives at European courts, as it injured their claim to all the territory east of the Mississippi,—-which probably was the ulterior object of the expedition. We must conclude therefore that the many histories which give 1777 as the (late of the Brady-Hamlin attack are wrong, especially as Sinclair's letters, written from Mackinac, agree with De Peyster’s. In Vol. XIX, page 600, De Peyster refers to both the Spanish Brady expedi- tions. Thomas Brady (“M’sieu Tom") had been selected from among the inhabitants to command at Cahokias by Col. Clark; all accounts agree that there were only sixteen men in his party, whether, in accordance with the above named authors it occurred in 1777 or 1781. Now turn to the speech of the Indian on page 453 and note that he claims that there were one hundred whites and eighty Indians, 8. statement that De Peyster would not have passed unchal- lenged had it not been approximately correct; also note that De Peyster’s letter is dated Jan. 8th. 1781, and that the capture was made on Dec. 5th, 1780. Philippe Francois de Rastel de Rocheblave was a. native of Dauphiny and had been an officer in the French service. Surprised in bed by Col. Clark and his Virginia militia, he surrendered Kaskaskia, which he had commanded under both French and British rule. He was sent prisoner in irons to Virginia, where he dishonored his parole and escaped to New York. See page 572. This “point of rock” is seven miles above Grand Rapids and one mile above Waterville, Ohio, on the Maumee river. This is the modern Coshocwn, Ohio. “Doddridge’s Notes” says that eighteen- of the Indians having been identiﬁed by a friendly Delaware as warriors, were executed by order of Col. Broadhead, but that the rest of them were massacred by the militia. without his knowledge or consent. The huts on- the other side of the liver were spared, not from oversight, but on account of the freshet. Captain Linctot was one of Col. George Rogers Clark’s militia ofﬁcers, detailed as Indian agent. He was one of the Illinois Frenchmen who joined the victorious Virginia army. The commander of this unfortunate expedition was Col. Archibald Loughry, who was County Lieutenant of Westmoreland, Penna. They were recruits on their way to join Clark at the Falls of the Ohio. (Winning of the West, Roosevelt.) Both the Illinois and Kankakee have been called Theakike, but at this date only the Kankakee was so called. In the journal kept by Washington, which fell into the hands of the French after Braddock’s defeat, there are many references to Half King, who seems to have been a staunch friend to the British and Colonists as against the French. Another diary of that time records that Half King had a. very low opinion of Washington’s military ability. (Montcalm and Wolfe, Parkman.) The copyists seem to have been even more than usually unfortunate with this document. L’Arbor Roche should be L’Arbre Croche,—near the modern Cross Village in Emmet county, Michigan. The Indians designated “Dr.” we can only guess may have been “Sr.”—a not improbable abbreviation for Saulteur. “Follevaines” we may be quite certain were Folle Avoines or Menominees. “Sales” were undoubtedly Sacs. The two names in parentheses (pxes or osogamis) ought probably to be read (Foxes or Outagamies); for “Scioeux” read Sioux; Aswoes are probably Iowas,—which the French used to spell Aiouez and Ayoes. These complaints refer to his capture at Vincennes in the spring of 1779 by Chol. G. R. Clark, his journey to Virginia in irons and his imprisonment t ere.
