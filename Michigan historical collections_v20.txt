PREFACE This, the twentieth volume of Pioneer and Historical Collections, as well as volume 19, is entirely devoted to copies of original documents from the Canadian Archives at Ottawa, relating to Michigan and its environs. The “Haldimand Papers” are a continuation of the same from volume 19, beginning with the year 1782, and carries them to a ﬁnish. in 1789, covering the period of the closing of the Revolutionary war, and the establishing of peace between Great Britain and the United States, and the evacuation of some of the Upper Military Posts, and comprises nearly half of the volume. The papers devoted to “Indian Affairs” cover a period from 1761 to 1800, and contain a mass of correspondence relative to the Indian Depart- ment and the Indian war with the United States. _ We trust its readers will ﬁnd it fully as interesting as any which have preceded it.

PREFACE TO REPRINT In reprinting this volume an effort has been made to correct such mistakes in names and dates as were evidently made by the copyist and‘explana-tory notes have been added as in Vol. XIX, this series. The ﬁrst half of the volume is a continuation of "01. XIX, which concludes the Haldimand Papers. Pages 300-673 are a collection of papers on Indian Aﬂ'airs; selected from the military correspondence in the Canadian Archives at Ottawa, 21 series marked “(7" and containing 1.062 volumes of manuscripts. These are continued in "01. XXIII this series. Conspicuous among the names in these papers is Joseph Chew. an old friend of Sir \Villiam Johnson, an ardent Loyalist. who with his son, held the oiﬁce of Secretary of the Indian Department under differ- ent members of the Johnson family from 1774-1806. A brief sketch of his interesting life is given in the appendix under p. 313. v M. AGNES BURTON Burton Library, Detroit, Mich, February. 1912

To induce the Rebels to undertake this Expedition they have received accounts that our garrison is very weak at Detroit, this information to the Rebels is from Prison- ers that have been carried to Detroit, who have returned. Some of the Rebel olﬁcers say that there will be an expedition by the allied Forces against Canada the Ensuing Summer, and its asserted that the Rebels have agreed to give the French Canada in case the combined Forces of the French & Rebels should be successful enough to reduce it. That this Engagement by the Rebels to the French is asserted by some who have seen the agreement on the proceedings of Congress this \Vinter. ‘ I have the honour to be Your Excellency"s most obedient and most humble Servant ' H.

I languish as people see that I am a renegade 8: when I consider that I am the son of a father who lost his life in the service of his King. I regard myself as dishonorable to my family, a rebel to God, & a traitor to the Prince. If my parents heard of my conduct it would give them a stroke of grief in their hearts to see that, after having reared me tenderly 8: given all the education possi- ble, me living as a renegade &'the English might say being in the‘ service he might leave you to act against you. It is for this reason I do not want you to forget that as a rebel to my Prince 1 am liable to dishonor my family by a dishonorable death though in war I would be willing to sacriﬁce the last drop of my blood for the service of His Britannic Majesty, seeing that since I have been in the service there has been no occasion for displeasure.

SIR I have just received an Express from Sandus‘ky, informing that two of the scouting Parties fell in with the Enemy on this side the Ohio. opposite to Wheeling, on the road to Sandusky. The Indians had some men wounded and escaped with difﬁculty not having been able to come at the number of the Enemy. A Deserter from them arrived at Sandusky, who reports that their number amount to one Thousand from the neighbourhood of Wheeling, designed against the Villages of Sandusky. The Chiefs have sent for the assistance promised upon the like occasions, which I cannot refuse them without running the risk of losing the conﬁdence of the Indians. I shall 'send off Capt. Caldwell,1 with the Rangers, some Canadian Volunteers 8: the Lake Indians. with a proportion of Ammunition, which I hope will give spirits to the Wiandotts. ’till something more can be conveniently done for them. The few People we can spare from this Post is triﬂing. but small as the numbers are, it may still be the means of making the Indians stand their ground. otherwise we shall have them all to maintain. By this opportunity I send doWn one Major and two Captains, with some women and children, desirous to follow their Fortunes and some other Prisoners as per Inclosed return—ﬁve of which are this day. delivered up by the Delawares who took them in a large boat loaded with three hundred barrels of ﬂour.

GEN. HALDIMAND TO BRIG. GEN. POWELL 21 GEN. FREDERICK HALDIMAND TO BRIG. GEN. H. WATSON POWELL B. Genl Powell Sm, 31st May 1782. I have received your letter of the 11th instant transmitting an extract of a letter from Major De Peyster dated 21st April. Extract of a let- ter from Lieut Johnson of the Indian Department and other in- telligence. I hope the small reinforcement you have already sent to Detroit will ' encourage the Indians if they are really in want of them untill a further can be forwarded. I cannot help being surprised that you have prevented Joseph from going to Oswego, particularly as he was anxious for it, his example & _ persuasion in the temper of mind the Indians are in respecting Major Ross, must have had a good effect and independent of that considera- tion my anxiety to remove him from Detroit was with av view to send him to Oswego, as well to have a Body of Indians ready for its Protec- tion as to provide for rapid Incursions into the Hiemy’s Country. Mr. Johnson’s intelligence can only be considered as Indian news in the present situation of affairs it is not possible a Rebel Army can approach Niagara_without your having early notice of it and in 6 days you can always reinforce yourself from Oswego I must desire therefore that you will immediately send Joseph to that place with every instruc- tion and recommendation you can think of to do away that viciou prejudice sown amongst the Indians. and conﬁrm them in their wonted attachment. In regard to Captain Amram’s1 (Ancrum) representation of the weak- ness of the Garrison at Carleton Island a suﬂ‘ieient number for the in- ternal duties of the place must certainly be kept other services cannot be expected of him. Major Ross is intimately acquainted with the neces- sities of that Post, and will not make requisitions beyond its abilities. Business such as tailoring &c. must be deferred untill winter and on all emergencies I expect the ofﬁcer’s servants are to do duty. And if Colo. Proctor’s Intelligence thro’ Vancamp by the son is to have any credit the Enemy’s designs against the Upper Country are eventually, depending entirely upon the evacuation of Charlestown.’ [B 104, p 323] 'Ancrum.

Corroborating reports of the intentions of the Enemy have deter- mined me to send a company of the Rangers immediately to Sandusky from hence, and I shall write to Capt. Caldwell,l that if it should happen. that he has no occasion to employ them, he will send them to Detroit where their assistance will be of very great use in repairing the works, which I am informed the late heavy rains have quite levelled. This movement obliges me to recall 100 men of the Detach- ment sent to Oswego. which will enable me to send another company of Rangers to Detroit should it become necessary. I informed your Excellency in my last, that I proposed going to Detroit in about ten days, as I expected by that time to receive any orders which you might send in consequence of having received your dispatches from England.

Caldwell which left him 27h “June, when all the Lake Indians had joined him, and were ready to “proceed towards Wheeling. As Capt.

As the Company of Rangers which were sent from hence. would be too late to join Capt. Caldwell Major De Peyster will of course employ them upon the works at Detroit. He has now 125 of that corps acting under his orders & I wish to be informed if your Excellency chuses they should remain there, or what part is to be recalled, and whether any of them are to be sent to Oswego to replace the 100 men, which arrived here yesterday from that Post.

Caldwell at Upper Sandusky, and after a few days consultation with the Indians collected there, we sett oil' from thence towards Wheeling to strike the nearest Settlement of the Enemy, and had advanced as far as the Whetstone Branch of Scioto between that place and Ko’oshawking,1 when we were overtaken by a message from the Shawanese; informing us that the Scouts were returned with a Prisoner & Scalp from the Falls; who reports the Enemy are assempled to come this way and in a few days would be on their march to the Shawanese Towns, the time being past that was appointed for this expedition. After some diﬂ‘iculty the Lake Indians were prevailed upon to turn their course this way, and are now upon their march hither. I arrived here last night, and this day about tWo o’clock a Runner came in from the Lower villages with an account that another Scout which had been sent out after the arrival of the one mentioned, was returned 8: had discovered the Enemy on their march below the Big Bone Lick & that they had dispatched three of ‘Sce appendix.

And that three days ago upon crossing the Ohio near the mouth of the Big Miamies River, they again dis- covered a Body of the Enemy who they suppose to be an advanced Party, that has either fallen in upon their Tracks, or ware come to take Post till the arrival of their main army &c. The Chiefs of the lower Villages inform as they have already sent messengers to the Wabash Indians 8.: all those of the neighbour hood of the Miamis to desire their assistance as soon as possible and request all who have gone back to Detroit to come out as they may still be in time either to reinforce us or pursue the Enemy or as occasion may require. They say they are now about two hundred and ﬁfty men there and deter- mined to meet the Enemy before they arrive in their neighbour hood. therefore desire to be Joined with all speed by the rest of their Brethren. Captain Caldwell will be here early tomorrow with the Lake Indians and this Evening the Indians of Those Towns are to be assembled to determine upon going forward. There is several Parties gone to endeavor to discover farther Intelligence 8; hope it will arrive in time to go by this opportunity. Since writing the above another Runner is arrived with an account, that they viewed the Enemy from the top of a Hill near the mouth of the Miamis three days ago & that they had two large Boats in' their front from which two Cannon ware ﬁred every evening upon coming to their Encamping ground and that they also saw a number of Indians with them, they say they are the most formidable Army that has yet come into their Country and from their appearance must intend more than attacking their Villages. The lowness of the Miamis will retard their progress so much that we are in hopes we shall have time to collect ourselves. July 23rd Captain Caldwell is Just come up with the Lake Indians but is apprehensive that the reinforcement with Capt. Bradtl will not arrive in time, however whatever force we are able to collect we shall endeavour to keep between them and Detroit which must undoubtedly be their object by all accounts. Capt. Caldwell begs leave to present his compliments to you. I am with great respect Dear Sir Your most obedient 8: very humble Servant A. Mc Kan Vi'akitunickie July 23rd 1782 ﬁles appendix. 5

It is necessary to acquaint your Ekcelly., which I do with much concern, that a few days ago I had advice from Detroit that a party of Rangers 8: Indians had fallen in with the Enemy on the 4th 8: 5th Ultimo as far advanced as to destroy the Indian villages as Sandusky. The Rebels (sic) were near 600 strong, and were severely dealt with, having 250 killed and wounded, a most unfortunate circumstance which attended this Rencounter, tho’ extremely bad in itself will, as usual, be highly exaggerated, a 001. Crawford who commanded, and two Captains were tortured by the Indians, in Retaliation for a wanton and barbarous massacre of about 80 Moravian Indians, lately committed at Muskingum by the Virginians wherein it is said Mr Crawford 8: some of that very Party were Perpetrators. I hope my Letters will arrive time enough to prevent any further mischief; tho’ I am very fearful it will not stop there, this act of cruelty is to be the more regretted as it awakens in the Indians that Barbarity to Prisoners which the unwearied etforts of His Majesty’s ofﬁcers had totally extinguished. A Letter from Major De Peyster says that a Genl. Irvin is to take the Route of Tuskarawas, a Party of Militia, the Shawanese Country, and Col. Clarke the Wabash with Artillery, that this EXpedition tho’ given out as intended against the Indian Villages, he is informed, is in reality a concerted Plan against Detroit, which Mr. Irvin brought with him from Congress—In consequence of this Intelligence I have reinforced the Upper Country with about 200 men.

Could the whole of the goods Be sent by the Leakes’ it would be a verry great saving, but they arrive so late from europe every year, that it is not possible to adopt that method. ~ I have the honor to be with great Esteem & Respect Sir Your most obedt and To Capt Mathews most humble Servant head Quarters Quebec Jorm CAMPBELL.

The impossibility of supplying the Quantity of Rum consumed at that Post, in Canoes, is evident, some unpardonable neglect has caused a Loss of many Pnncheons at, or on its way to Mackinac, which is the cause of their being in want of that article.

It is a duty however incumbent on me to beg of you once more to speak to the chiefs and assure them that Brig. General Powell was greatly shock at hearing the report spread by Zeans, and strongly recommends that it may be stop’d. He is however still in hopes that Zeans must have greatly exaggerated matters as I have not received a Line from you on the subject. Some Lake Indians who arrived from Sanguina. left this two 'Days ago, they will no doubt spread a false report that the Sacks on leaving Michilimackinac fell upon the wives & children of the Ottawas -I have already desired Capt.

Sm I have the honor to inform Your Excellency that I arrived here on the 31st Ulto, when Major De Peyster presented me with the enclosed Letter, which I should immediately have transmitted, had there not been every reason to expect long before now a more particular account of the strength and movements of the Enemy, tho none has yet arrived, which gives reason to suppose, they are either gone back, or are at so great a distance, that it must be at least a month before they can arrive here in force, should their destination be against this Post. When I left Niagara every thing seemed quiet here, which deter- mined me to remain no longer than was necessary to execute your commands. I therefore directed that my letters should not be for- warded, lest they should miss me in the passage; for which reason I propose leaving this place in two or three days, should no accounts arrive before that time, which might require my attendance here. I found the works here in a very ruinous state, from the depreda- tions occasioned by the continual heavy rains, but from the indefa- tigible zeal with which the garrison continue to repair them, I do not doubt they will be in a very defensible state before the Enemy can appear before them, as Captain Caldwell is now supposed to have two thousand Indians with him, which with the two armed vessels, that will be stationed at the mouth of the Miamis River, must retard their progress very much, if not totally defeat them. From some late Intelligence, which Major De Peyster has received, every thing is very quiet upon the Wabash, nor is it expected that the Enemy will approach the country by that River.

I can assure you Sir, that I have no kind of interest in those bills further than they make a reinit- tance to me, so far I am disappointed heretofore when his Excellency re- fused any Bills, we let them lay over, untill the matter was further ex- plained & were this my own concern it should be the same still, but as it is otherwise I must take the necessary steps in having the Bills noted 8; posted when due if not paid should I act otherwise my correspondent if he chooses might make me liable for the money—I am more cautious since the Bills of Col Johnson Gov1r Taylor & Forsyth, was refused last Fall by the General 8; it was hinted to 8: in the winter by their attorney that I was liable for the money & had not his Excellency afterwards paid them I am convinced Mr Taylor would have insisted on my doing it & he had the law on his side. I must request as a favour that you would take a proper opportunity of representing this matter to general Haldimand 8: hope that he will believe that nothing would induce me to take this step, but that of saving myself harmless from a correspondent who might take advant- age of my neglect as a merchant 8: which the Law allows him to do.

Sm ~ I have the honor to inform Your Excellency that I returned to this Post last night. No accounts arriving from Capt. Caldwell after my letter to you of the 7h Instant, and some Indians who came in from a Scout, reporting that they had been over the ground, where the Enemy were supposed to have been and that they saw no appearance of them. I thought any longer stay at Detroit unnecessary; and left it on the 9b in the Gage, but had not proceeded more than four miles, when a sudden and heavy gust came on from the Westward attended by a violent thunder storm, and the cross Jack yard giving way, the vessel was laid almost gunwale too, when the main mast went about six feet below the cross trees, which probably prevented her from going to the bottom. As soon as the wreck was cleared, Captain Burnet run her up to Detroit, and owing to his activity she was reﬁtted by the 1211 when we again left Detroit and arrived that afternoon at the Island, where we found the Dunmore, and hearing there was a letter for Major De Peyster containing orders for draughting the 47h Regiment, I opened it and observing that three ofﬁcers of the King’s Regt. were to be sent to Makina to relieve those of the 47h and knowing that there was no Captain in Detroit, except Capt. Bird who is the acting Engineer, I desired Major De Peyster to send three subalterns ’till your Excell- ency’s pleasure should be known, as you possibly might not chuse to send a Captain, there being so few with the Regiment. Upon my arrival here I ordered a Captain to be sent to Detroit, as the command of the ﬁve companies there will fall upon Captain Potts, 1i‘lce reports made by (‘01.

Three Chippewas from near the falls of the Ohio have brought in the papers of a Captain Hart whom they killed near a small Fort.

Gov“ Sinclair and Major De Peyster, respecting your private letter of the 21st of June, to prevent oifensive operations being undertaken ’till further orders. And I am sorry to inform you that during my stay at Detroit Major De Peyster received some very disagreeable reports of shocking cruelties lately committed by the Indians upon which a. Belt was immediately sent to them, representing the impropriety of their conduct, that I very much disapprove of it, and that if they continued to treat the people with cruelty, who fell into their hands. I should acquaint your Excellency with it, and was conﬁdent, they would be deprived of every assistance and protection the Troops used to give them, which I hope will have a. proper etfect, a the Belt which was sent was one to which they had promised to pay the strictest attention whenever it should be sent. The Rebel Prisoners shall be sent down as soon as they can be col- lected. I am informed the Flank Companies of the 84h Regiment are already gone to Oswego, and as this Post is very much weakened owing to the ague and fever which prevails very much in the Corps of Rangers, I shall desire Major Boss to send back the small Detachment of the Kings. Before I left Detroit I desired Major De Peyster, when the present hurry is over, to send back all the Rangers, except one company which I believe will be very useful at that Post, if Your Excellency approves of their remaining there; and if you intend making any particular arrangements for the Vessels upon either of the Lakes for the ensuing Winter. I hope you will signify your pleasure time enough for them to take their stations, as the orders were too late last year. I take the ﬁrst opportunity of transmitting a return of Ordnance wanting at Detroit, and propose sending down the reports of that Post

I have just received advice of the arrival of the Adventure at Fort Schlosser; she is come down to assist in the Transport between that Post and Fort Erie; She left the Miamis River on the 12h Inst, and a Letter from Capt. Grant, who is in the_ Faith upon that station, mentions that no accounts had then been re ceived either from Captain Caldwell or of the motions of the Rebels. Immediately after my arrival at Detroit Captain Grant went oil? to the Miamis, and as I think it very much for Captain La Mothe’s credit I beg leave to mention that he went up in the Faith, tho’ a senior ofﬁcer to Captain Caldwell, to serve as a Volunteer under him, rather than remain inactive at Detroit—Captain Grant procured a guide for him, and he proceeded to join Captain Caldwell. I wish to have procured some stores, which are wanted for the Engineer’s Departments without troubling your Excellency, but ﬁnding it impossible, I enclose a return of them, which I hope you will be so good as to order to be forwarded.

I forgot to mention to the General, that I was informed. when at Detroit, that Lt. Govr Sinclair had bought up a quantity of Rum at Makina, tho‘ the Rum, which came up to this Post last year, was divided into three equal parts, two of which were sent to Detroit, and Major De Peyster forwarded one third of it to Makina, which he looked upon (from the knowledge he had of the issues which ought to be made there) to be their proportion. The Lt. Govr has not applied for any—however I desired Major De Peyster to send him 1000 gallons, which will not go far, and if a supply is not immediately sent up from Canada, that Post will be entirely without, unless the Governor pur- chases at a high price.

CAPT. M’KEE TO MAJ. DE PEYSTER 49 CAPT. ALEXANDER MC KEE TO MAJOR ARENT 8. DE PEYSTER SHAWANESE COUNTRY Sm Augt 28b 17 82. MyLetters of the 22d 8: 23rd July informed you of the reports brought us of the Enemy’s motions at that time, which was deliv- ered by the Chiefs of the Standing Stone Village,1 and conﬁrmed by Belts & Strings of Wampum in so earnest a manner, that could not but gain credit with us. We had upon the occasion the greatest Body of Indians collected to an advantageous piece of ground near the Piccawa2 village, that have been assembled in this Quarter since the commencement of the war, and perhaps may never be in higher spirits to engage the Enemy, when the return of scouts from the Ohio informed us that the accounts we had received were false, this disappointment notwithstanding all our endeavours to keep them together occasioned them to disperse in disgust with each other. The Inhabitants of this country who were the most immediately interested in keeping in a Body were the ﬁrst that broke off, and tho’ we advanc’d towards the Ohio with upwards of three hundred Hurons and Lake Indians, few of the Delawares Shawanese or Mingoes followed us. On our arrival at the Ohio we remained still in uncertainty with respect to the Enemy’s motions, and it was thought best from hence to send scouts to the Falls, and that the main Body should advance into the Enemy’s country, and endeavour to lead out a. Party from some of their Forts by which . we might be able to gain some certain Intelligence. Accordingly we crossed the Ohio and arrived the 18th Inst. at one of the Eenemy‘s Settlements call’d Bryant’s Station, but the Indians discovering their numbers prevented their coming out, and the Lake Indians ﬁnding this, rush’d up to the Fort and set several out Houses on ﬁre, but at too great a distance to touch the Fort, the wind blowing the contrary way. The ﬁring continued this day, during which time a Party of about twenty of the Enemy approached a part which happened not to be guarded, and about one half of them reached it, the rest being drove back by a few Indians who were near the place. The next morning ﬁnding it to no purpose to keep up a ﬁre longer upon the Fort as we were getting men killed, & had already several men wounded which were to be carried. The Indians determined to retreat, and on the 20h reached the Blue Licks,s where we encamp’d near an advantageous Hill & expecting the Enemy would pursue, determined here to wait for ’em, keeping spies at the Lick, who on the morning of the 21st dis- covering them, and at half past seven o’clock we engaged them and ‘See appendix.

We were not much superior to them in numbers. they being about 200 pick’d men from the Settle- ment of Kentucky commanded by the Colonels Todd,l Trigg, Boone. and Todd with the Majors Harlin and McGeary, most of whom fell in the action. From the best inquiry I could make up0n the spot, there was upwards of one hundred & Forty kill’d and taken, with near one hundred Riﬂes—several being thrown into a deep River that were not recovered. It was said by the Prisoners that a Colonel Logan1 was expected to join them with one hundred men more; we waited upon the ground this day for him, but seeing there was not much probability of his coming, we set off and crossed the Ohio the second day after the action. Capt. Caldwell and I arrived at this place last night with a design of sending some assistance to those who are bringing the wounded People, who are fourteen in number. We had ten Indians killed with Mr. La Bute of the Indian Dept who by sparing the life of one of the Enemy and endeavouring to take him Prisoner lost his own. To our disappointment we ﬁnd no Provisions brought forward to this place, or likelihood of any for some time, and we have entirely subsisted since we left this on what we got in the woods and took from the Enemy. 'The Prisoners all agree in their account that there is no talk of any Expedition from that Quarter, nor indeed are they able without assist- ance from the Colonies, and that the Militia of the country have been employed during the summer in building the Fort at the Falls, and what they call a. Row Galley, which has made one trip up the River to the mouth of the big Miamis, and occasioned that alarm which cre- ated us so much trouble. She carries one six pounder, six 4 pounders. & two 2 pounders, and rows eighty oars—she had at the big bone Lick one hundred men, but being chieﬂy draughts from the Militia, many of ’em left her on different parts of the River. One of the Prisoners mentions the arrival of Boats lately from Fort Pitt, and that Letters has pass’d between the Commanding ofﬁcer of that place and Mr. Clarke, intimating that preparation is making there for another Expe- dition in the Indian Country. We have since our arrival heard some- thing of this matter and that the particulars has been forwarded to you-A Detachment of Rangers with a large Party of Delawares and Shawanese are gone that way, who will be able to discover the truth of this matter. I am this day favoured with yours of the 6th of August, containing the report of Isaac Zeans concerning the cruelties of the Indians. It

The Memorial of the Merchants of Montreal trading to the Posts of Niagara and Detroit Humbly Sheweth, That your memorialist under sanction of your Excellencies Licenses for trading to the upper Posts have in the course of the summer for- warded large quantities of Merchandize to Carleton Island whereof a very small part north hitherto been sent from that part- owing to the great Transport of Provisions and Stores for the diﬂferent garrisons. That your Memorialists having entertained hopes that their Mer- chandize would have been transported in the King’s Vessels are unpro- vided with proper store Houses at the Island the want of which must at this advanced period of the season subject your memorialist to great damage by the bad 8: wet weather—and being informed that there are still large quantities of provisions to be sent forward they are appre- hensive that few if any of their goods will be sent from Carleton Island this season which circumstance would occasion great detriment to the Trade of the Province in general, and prove particularly hurtful and distressing to your memorialists and correspondents at the Upper Posts That at this present time there are above one hundred & Forty Battoe load of Merchandize upon the Island which your memorialist! may with conﬁdence assure your Excellency exceed the sum of Sixty Thousand pounds in value allmost every article of the manufactories of Great Britain and part of them imported from thence so far back as twelve months ago, the whole falling due to the Merchants in London by the ﬁrst of March next & as Returns cannot be had for their goods

MEMORIAL OF MERCHANTS OF MONTREAL 59 till the year after their arrival at the Posts for which they are destined, the detaining of them during the winter ensuing at Carleton Island would occasion a very heavy charge of accumulated Interest and greatly injure the credit of your Memorialists by being deprived of their remittances for twelve months longer. That as Your Excellency has not thought proper to allow to any vemels on the Lakes, besides those belonging to the King and as your memorialists are prevented from transporting their goods in Battoes so that no other mode of conveyance is left to them but in these vessels— the situation of your Memorialists is realy distressing, seeing they are obliged to pay the same freight as if in Merchants Vessels—which in your memorialists apprehension should intitle them to a more speedy conveyance of their goods than if no Freight were demanded. Your memorialists being persuaded of your Excellency’s care 8: attention to the commercial Interests of the Province, have the strong- est conﬁdence that your Excellency will grant them relief in the Premises and if their Request is not inconsistent with more momentous concerns they pray that Your Excellency would be pleased to permitt that the two larger Vessels, the Limonade (Limnade original) and Seneca on Lake Ontario might make one full trip with merchandize from the Island to Niagara and your memorialists shall ever pray.

DE PEYSTER SHAWANESE COUNTRY Sm , Sept. 22nd 1782 I did myself the favour to write you the 20h since which time arrived a Runner from a Party of Indians, who after the unsuccessful attempt on Wheeling, made another upon a small Fort between that & the Beaver Creek, in which they also failed, having two Indians killed, but took a man passing from Beaver Creek to that place, who upon examination informed them that he belonged to an Army of Twelve Hundred men assembled at that place, with an intention of cutting off the Huron villages, and that they were to set out in two or three days, and this Indian being three days upon his way suppose the Enemy to be now on their march. From the number of Parties still out from the lower villages, and the report of the Enemy’s coming the other way, our strength will be greatly diminished and divided, however I shall collect all the Force I can here to go towards Sandusky, and perhaps the neighbouring Indians of Detroit and Roche de Bout1 may be prevailed upon to join these as they will still be in time, if they are expeditious. I have dispatched an Express to Capt. Chesne to invite the Miamis to assist us. [signed] ALEX McKss Major De Peyster 26—Since writing to you the foregoing two of the Fort Pitt Del- awares are come in, they made their escape from that place twelve days ago, and say that General Irvine who commands the Army this way, was arrived with Five Hundred Troops from below J oin’d to those collected on this side of the mountains, will make the Army ﬁfteen hundred strong—They were to leave1 Beaver Creek the 18h or 28h Sept and after passing the Huron Villages to meet Clarke1 at the Shawanese Villages, who they say have orders to move this way before this time. They are of opinion that the Enemy are ﬁve or six days now upon their march, and are to bring two Field Pieces with them which was sent to Beaver Creek from Fort Pitt before the above Indians left it, we shall ﬁnd difﬁculty to collect Indians sufﬁcient in this country, now to oppose this army.

The delays in receiving the Indian Goods from on board the Amazon owing to her having been captured, it is feared will prevent the supply for Detroit being forwarded this year. but that for Niagara may arrive time enough, and the articles forwarded from your store will be replaced.

I yesterday received your Excellency‘s Letter of the 2511 August with a duplicate dated the 3d of the same month, and a Copy of the Public Letter written by your Excellency and Admiral Digby to General Washington the 2nd August. I am concerned to learn that notwithstanding the Overtures of Peace made on the part of Great Britain and the Expectation entertained at Home of their success so little disposition has been manifested by our Enemies in your Quarter for that desirable end. Which from accounts I daily receive is but too much the case upon the Frontiers of this Province, for since my last Communication to your Excellency of the affair at St. Dusky under Captain Caldwell of the Rangers. He was under the necessity of again attacking that determined Band of adven- turers who menace the Destruction of the Indians & an attempt upon Detroit, and have actually established and are strengthening a Post at the Falls of the Ohio. He however routed them completely & killed about 150 amongst whom were the Commandant and ﬁve or six Field Ofﬁcers. The same letter informs that another Party was on the march to St. Duskey and Captain Caldwell was hurrying to meet it. The Enemy is likewise very Jealous of Oswego, and by a Letter which I yesterday received from Major Ross, Scouts have approached so near the Fort as to be perceived by his Centries. They likewise advance upon Lake Champlain to the water side, a temerity unknowu until] our Scouting Parties and Indians have been withdrawn.

That they were commanded by a Gen- eral Irvine who had sent two Canoes loaded with Cannon Ball for the use of General Clarke who was to move against the Shawanese Towns. and endeavour to form a junction with him at Sandusky. That he— Irvine—knew that the Indians under Captain Bradt had attacked and killed the men belonging to one of the Canoes, and thrown the Ball into the Ohio, but that he was in hopes the other Canoe would get down safe. That a Colonel Butler1 who commanded at Wioming was to move up the Susquehannah to amuse the Six Nations from taking any part with the Shawanese, and Wiandotts &c. That on the 9th of the month ﬁnding they did not march from Fort Pit, the Troops began to murmur, but that the reasons given by Irvine satisﬁed them, which were, that he had received orders to wait the arrival of three hundred Continentals,2 and one hundred more of the Militia, who were then on their march to join him.

I must observe, that on my asking Mr. Hazel the reason why Pipe did not let the deserters come on to Detroit.

When I came here I found the advice they had received was from the Loyalists Robert Bruce1 and William Hynes. who made their escape from Whitey Creek upon the Monongahela the 5th Inst & reports the Enemy to have been making preparations to carry on an Expedition against the Villages since August. and that they would have been upon their march some time ago only the Express was intercepted at Wheeling, which was sent to the Falls to apprise Mr. Clarke who is also to move towards the Shawanese Towns at the same time and to form a juncture with General Irvine who commands the Army from Fort Pitt at this Place, each army is to consist of 13 or hi hundred men; and that the only thing which detained them when those men set oﬁ, was the arrival of a reinforcement whom they had received an account were then near at hand, in consequence of which an Express was sent again to Mr. Clarke, which the above Infbrmants supposes to have been seen passing down the Ohio, on their crossing 'See appendlx.

It is the opinion of those men that General Irvine from the great preparations that have been made will undoubtedly at all events make :1 Push this way notwithstanding the Season is so far advanced, and that if they ﬁnd the Indians are msy conquest. their design is to reach Detroit. They likewise say that an Army of ﬁfteen hundred men is gone up the Susquehannah to strike the Six Nation Settlements near Niagara.

7O HALDIMAND PAPERS MAJOR GEN. RlEDESEL TO GEN. FREDERICK HALDIMAND [Trunslatlon] Private Isms .wx Nolx Sm 1st Novr 1782 I had the honor to receive two private letters from your Excellency of the 27h October one at mid day & the other in the evening, the ﬁrst respecting Captain Willoc, the second with the information of Sir Guy Carleton. Your conﬁdence day by day keeps me under greater obligation to Your Excellency & your conﬁdence is sacred, & my attachment will be the greatest proof of it. Your Excellency’s wishes are always law to me and in this case noth- ing will interfere, although the separation with a man who has lived seven years with me costs me dear and as Captain Willoc had taken pleasure in understanding my tastes, he easily assisted me in my cor- respondence, 8: his discretion was his best proof, poor man he in very inﬁrm with internal gout for the last two‘months. I would look upon it as a proof of your Excellency’s goodness if he would be allowed to return next Spring after the blow is struck. He left to day as he writes me from Sore] for Montreal. . The movement of the enemy in two bodies against the frontiers of the Upper Country appears to be the forerunner to the execution of that Plan, which Dr. Franklin presented three years ago to the Court of France 8: I do not doubt that they intend to attempt Niagara or Detroit after having ruined the Indian Country, but I ﬂatter myself Your Excellency’s reinforcements will be in time to frustrate their plans, and who knows but the Indians, encouraged by the reinforce- ment, may not strike an important blow against them. It is a pity that Sir Guy had not immediately sent an order to Halifax to send some troops to Your Excellency for by this reinforce ment Your Excellency would have been able to keep together the detachment for the Upper Country, but this is the policy which does more harm than the enemy themselves. It is a good thing Your Excellency is able to state to General Patterson what force he will have, the moment the navigation is open & that will put Your Excel- lency in a state to reinforce the upper posts in the month of May. I fear the troops from Halifax will have a very bad passage. If the enemy (as I hope not) gain possession of Lake Ontario, the next step would be to appear by Hazen’s Road on the Sorel, and attempt the Junction of the two corps at Montreal. I fear Isle aux Noix will be - an obstacle to this plan, but it is necessary to trust in Providence & hope for the best.

MEMORIAL OF PHILIP ROCHEBLAVE TO GEN. HALDIMAND i 73 MEMORIAL OF PHILIP ROCHEBLAVE1 TO GEN. HALDIMAND2 [Translatiom] To His Excellency Frederick Haldimand Governor General and Com- mander in Chief in the Province of Quebec and its Dependancies Sac. &c. ~ SIR, I the undersigned have the honor of representing that Mr. Robert Ellis [Ellice] has protested the bill of exchange drawn on him by Mr. George McBeath our attorney at Michilimackinac on the pretext that we have refused to pay one of the same tenor and date to his order drawn in favour of the said Mr. McBeath by Patrick Sinclair Lt. Governor of the said place to cover his expences. I the undersigned embarassed by the negotiations in his favour take the liberty of praying Your Excellency to explain whether it is to be accepted in the future of it it is absolutely refused fer which we can take legal steps but it is our duty humbly to submit to you some remarks that he may not mistake the quality & quantity of those who can pursue & to avoid if it is possible, these steps which, justiﬁed by necessity 8: their legality will not cost less (a son coeur?) Filled with conﬁdence in your goodness of heart the undersigned dares to represent to you that a similar refusal would seem to break up the conﬁdence they always had in the justice of the government which you represent. The same bill & the statements sent in conse— quence to Your Excellency are for the payment of merchandise bought by legal authority 8: used in the service of government. In these cir- cumstances which would equally & sufﬁciently justify to every one & not only to the numerous creditors myself 8: all other persons here. The undersigned is far from thinking that by the partial payment Offered to Mr. Ellice they could attempt to establish the strange S: odious difference between creditors. It can not be disproved that the workmen employed in building the fort were daily paid with the said goods which were also employed to buy goods for their support & who can only regard this bill as an integral part of the talent which will not surprise the public 8: which will not grieve nor indemnify this unfortunate colony. The idea of one person and his family being completely pillaged of his goods by the Americans under pretext of his attachment to Government, is no reason that the same government should feed his family, pay his debts 8; enable him to escape the just claims of his appointment. It is with the same respectful courage he asks your Excellency to 18cc Vol. XIX, p. 321 thls series revised edition. *For Gen. Haldimand‘s reply see p. 317, Vol. XI.

FREDERICK HALDIMAND Private Sonar. 6th Nov. 1782 SIR ' I give your Excellency my most humble thanks for having sent me Colonel Wurumb’s letter 8: I send it to your Excellency to read; it appears that no new orders arrived for the Commander in Chief, neither was the change of the ministry1 known, except that the evacua- tion of Charlestown was countermanded & that it was generally thought it would be best to keep New York. All the arrangements and orders of England were so contradictory that they are an enigma to me but I believe that in three weeks from now Your Excellency could receive positive news whether Sir Guy intended to quit New York or not. I suppose that the Enemy‘s movement towards the upper Country are relative to the suppositions of Washington that we will evacuate New York, and that his preliminary movements are the preparations for the expedition which the Rebels 8: Rochebeau’s corps intend to make when our troops to the South have quitted the continent. if now Sir Guy keeps New York their plan will be frustrated and if on the other hand we quit New York 8: that the new expedition to the Indies should prevent France from sending for the cooperation a ﬂeet into the R-iver'St. Lawrence I hope that Canada will risk nothing, except perhaps to try to take Detroit to cut off the fur trade which is the feeble idea of an individual who is encouraged by the goodness of your Excellency in always telling him sincerely his sentiments. According to your Excellency’s promise I have been 0 bold as to add a little letter to Wurumb at New York I am sure that he will answer me truly 8: by this channel your Excellency will know what is generally said in New York.

The Indians in general but particularly at Detroit complain heavily of our permitting Prisoners to return to their Homes during the war, and have frequently upbrided us with exposing them a second time to the Resentment of the same Enemy. They are particularly anxious for the Detention of Col. Campbell and have formally requested it. Altho’ I cannot take upon me to Depart so far from the Instruc- tions of the King’s Ministers, circumstances unknown to me may authorize it on your Part, I have therefore thought ﬁt to put it in your Power, a few Prisoners are arrived at Montreal from the Upper Country which cannot be sent by this opportunity.

I am honored with Your Excellencys Letter of the 31st Oct. with its enclosures to which-I shall pay particular Attention. A coppy of Sir Guy Carleton’s Letter I have sent to Major De Peyster, together with your Excellency’s Letter to him inclosed to me. The other Par- ticulars mentioned in your Letter respecting Rum and Provisions shall be carefully attended to.

We are greatly distressed at present for quarters to both men and officers, I have therefore pushed on from on board ship, two Companies, one to Fort Erie and another to Fort Schlosser, and 1 have detained the Angelica at Fort .Erie and the weather at present being very favourable she will carry away to Detroit. Captain Ancrum and his Company, the moment they are gone, the Company at Fort Schlosser, shall be sent over and a company from this go over to Fort Schlosser the other six Companies we shall quarter in the best manner we can. The \Vyandot is taking on board the Indian Presents, and will sail much about the same time with the Angelica and Captain Ancrum’s Company. Capt \Villoc being Capt. of Granadiers of the King’s Regiment, and when Major Potts comes away no Captain will remain ~with Major Depeyster and the ﬁve companies above, the Granadiers being there, it was absolutely necessary, that Capt. Willoc should go over, he goes in Wyandot with the Indian Presents he will be at Fort Erie this Evening 8: Capt. Ancrum will be there to morrow Evening. the Cattle on the Carrying P'iace are so bad, that we were under the necessity of sending the six King’s Horses here, to transport the ofﬁcer’s baggage. As its probable that Major Depeyster will order the Hope or Felicity across the Lake with Major Potts, (especially as we have a great appearance of good weather) in that case I shall be able to send another Company of the 34h to Detroit, and then shall make shift to lodge the other seven Companies on this side the Lake, The two Detachments of the King’s at Fort Erie & Fort Schlosser are to come to Niagara and during the winter we shall stowe them with the others, three and three in a bed.

RICHARD DOBIE Sm, \Ve are sorry to be informed by yourself, that you have not yet received payment for those deductions made on Lieut Governor Sin- clair’s Bills on His Excellency General Haldimand dated 31st January & §0h April last, that the original Bills lie in the hands of His Excel- lency, and that you have made no protest, for the sum unpaid. We are really at a loss how to account to our correspondents for this neglect, and they may now dispute reimbursing us money which they were undoubtedly liable to, had a. Regular Protest been made at the proper time. To remedy however the Evil as much as possible and as we are the principal holders of drafts on you, on which those deductions unluckily fall, we are to request that you will cause a demand to be made of the original bills above speciﬁed, which having obtained, you will order a protest if Payment is refused for the sum yet due, but if His Excellency refuses to deliver up the Bills you are then to cause a protest to be made against the Commander in Chief for such refusal and another protest against all concerned for the sum unpaid.

He sent out a party of Indians after a man who Deserted, with orders to bring in his Scalp, which they did in 24 hours this has put a stop to desertion & it was practiced with the same success in Col. Butlers Rangers at Niagara, I therefore wish you to desire Mr Sch to station 5 or 6 indians Near the B.

SIR I was in hopes that I should have been able to inform Your Excell- ency, that the Indian Presents, with two companies of the 34h Re2i~ ment, Had arrived at Detroit by the end of last month; But such has been the continuance of the Westerly Winds, that we have been unfortunately disappointed, after repeated Trials; and once the three vessels got beyond Presque Isle; They are all come back, and we have been forced to lay them up for the winter. The Troops not getting to Detroit so late in the season, I hope will be no great disappointment to Major De Peyster, as they will get there in the Spring, as early a it’s possible for them to act —- — -— The want of the Indian Presents I am afraid will be a real disappointment to the Major. | In a former
Page 85
BRIG. GEN. MACLEAN TO GEN. HALDIMAND ' 85 Letter I took the Liberty of mentioning to Your Excellency, the slovenly irregular manner in which all the Indian Presents have been sent up from Canada. Colonel Butler is in great distress about it, and desired me to say, that he never yet has been able to get an Invoice from Colonel Campbell’s Ofﬁce; excepting once, when he was obliged to apply to Your Excellency, and got a positive order to get the invoice; but that before or since, He never has had any. Upon the arrival here of the goods in that state, a survey was demanded; Copy of which survey I have the honor to transmit herewith. From which it will appear, that the assortment is every way unequal to the pur- poses for which it was intended, tho’ there are a great quantity of things not wanted. A very large quantity of kettles, tho’ they had a sufﬁcient quantity before . . . . Twenty two large Trunks of Gartering _ six times more than was wanted, besides their having had a sufﬁcient quantity of that article—and two large Trunks of spunges, what USO they are intended for no man here can tell—On the other hand, there is not one yard of Leggin stuﬂf, nor of surges; 8:. but eighty small pieces of callicoes, not above one sixth part of the quantity wanted, and Linen excepted. . . . The Indian Department want almost every other article of cloathing—had any kind of attention been given by the People intrusted with forwarding the assortment of Indian Presents from Montreal, it would have saved expence, and a great deal of ill- will 8: confusion amongst the Indians. In this disagreeable necessity, I have been able to prevail with the Merchants here to lend us all they had, upon condition of delivering them an equal quantity of as good a quality next Spring, and as most of those goods were at Fort Erie, I have also promised them they shall be delivered at Fort Eric. I however must do the merchants the justice to say that they came ‘into my proposal with a good grace. The Quantity of Leggin Stutf and Serges, however fall short, so that Colonel Butler is under the necessity of giving a shirt instead of a pair of Leggins, which is double the value of the Leggins—and as the Indians always expect a yard of serge for a child, they must have a yard of callico in place of the serge which costs four times the price. and the Indians do not like it so well ..... We are 2000 yards short of Strouds. I The Seneca sailed from Carleton Island on the 9th December with the remaining three companies of the 34th Regiment, and six hundred setts of Bedding, which we stand greatly in want of here; and its possible some Indian Presents might be on board her. But after getting above half way to this Place she was forced to return to Carleton Island from the severity of the weather. I I shall transmit to Captain Mathews an exact account
Page 86
86 ' HALDIMAND PAPERS of what I have been able to Borrow from the merchants, each Mer- chants’ account' separately, that the goods they are to get in return may be put up separately for each, and that your EXcellency may be pleased to order them to be transported in the winter to Coteau du Lac, that they may come up as early as possible in the Spring, to enable' me to keep my word with the Merchants, and induce them on any other occasion to help us, should the same necessity occur; and I shall be much obliged to your Excellency to direct that this may be done. I am sorry to acquaint your Excellency that Lieut 001. Bolton1 re~ covers but slowly—he is the only man here in any degree equal to the management of the Indians. Its surprising what good humor he sent them away after he had acquainted them of his being short of several I articles of cloathing for them this year. | As I have not heard from Major De Peyster since the 21st Novl' I am in hopes that matters there, are not so bad as might be expected from Mr. McKee’s Letter, since I have not a doubt but the Major would have sent an EXpress by land, had there been anything very alarming. Its true indeed that he Would delay sending an Ekpress by Land, so long as he would have any expectation of the arrival of the three Vessels from hence; in that case the Express, if sent, has scarcely had time to be here. In order however to enable him to inform the Indians with the great efforts made by your Excellency in forwarding Troops to their assistance. which nothing but the unfavourable winds prevent from arriving at Detroit last month and that they shall be there early in the Spring. it wanted; I have on the 17th Inst. sent two Indians and two Rangers express to Detroit, which measure, I hope your Excellency will approve of, as well as my having borrowed the goods from the Merchants. . Should any Express arrive from Detroit, before the return of mine, I shall forward it immediately that you may have the earliest Intelli- gence possible of what has happened at Detroit; tho’ I am convinced ' Major Depeyster is too good an oﬂicer to delay a moment sending an Express did he think it necessary.

MAJ. DE PEYSTER TO BRIG. GEN. MACLEAN 87 MAJOR ARENT S. DE PEYS-TER TO BRIG. GEN. ALLAN MACLEAN DETROIT January 7h 1783. Sm Just as I was sending off an Express, your Dispatches arrived. You should have heard from me before, but that I waited a conﬁrmation of the situation of affairs in the Indian Country, and the return of my Scouts from Fort Pitt, which were detained by the badness of the weather. My last acquainted you that the Enemy had advanced as far as the Standing Stone. I have now the pleasure to inform you that they did no other damage than destroy the Chillicotheke Village,1 a Trader’s House & Packs near the Glaise, and killed ten Indians—since which our People have seen them cross the Ohio—Their sudden retreat I attribute to their being disappointed in a Junction with the Army from Fort Pitt, which my scouts informed me was dispersed by an order from Congress. Should this not be the Forerunner of a Peace with the Americans we shall, in all probability, have warm work in the Indian Country the ensuing Campaign. It therefore gives me pleasure to hear that a Reinforcement may be expected in the Spring, and of your readiness to give me every assistance in your power. I shall only call upon you in case of necessity. The two Companies of the 34h and two Companies of Rangers, or one more at least, would be necessary to be here in readiness, if it were only to keep up the drooping spirits of the Indians, who begin to fear they are to be the dupes of the war. I must request of you to mention to Lieut Col. Butler, that it would be of great detriment to the service should Cap- tain Caldwell be relieved, or called away upon any occasion from this Post, he is au fait of the Indian Country and the Indians are fond of him. The weather set in here more severe than has ever been known. On the 5h Decr. ‘the wind shifting from West to S. West Farenheit‘s Thermometer fell from Forty-one to three, which is thirty-eight degrees in twelve hours. It is therefore no wonder the vessels put back to Fort Erie. ' Your letters shall be forwarded in a few days for Michillimackinac, when I shall give Captain Robertson such Information and hints as may be necessary for him to have from this Post. The Indians which came with your Express I wish to detain untill I can give them an opportunity of seeing some of our Copper Coloured Gentry; It will be of inﬁnite service they should have a meeting. Mr. Alex Mc Kee is not yet come in, owing to the roads having for some time past been almost impassable. 1 Clark attacked Cbillicothe Nov. 10 cf ante p. 60 and 69.

Extract of a Letter from Capt. Grant to Brig. General Maciean dated at Detroit Jany. 8h 1783. [a 103, p 4] ABRAHAM CIIYLERl TO GEN. FREDERICK HALDIMAND Sm I beg leave to represent to your Excellency that having in suport of the King’s cause been obliged to abandon my estate and property, I arrived at N. York in Decemr—76 destitute of money in which expen- sive place I have remained for Refuge with a large Family near six years, and have been under necessity to involve myself for their suport as well as advances made to distressed Loyalists upwards of two thou- sand Pounds. I had ﬂattered myself to repay this sum out of some moneys that were due me previous to this Rebellion, from Mr. Graverat at Detroit, which being the only part of all my estate or property that escaped Rebel conﬁscation. I had impowered Mess" Ellice & McCombe (Ma- comb) to recover this demand and expected to have found it in their hands, at my arrival in this country, but in addition to the many mis- fortunes that have attended me in this unhappy war I am again dis- appointed, as will appear by an extract of a Letter herewith; those gentle- men in pursuing their own Interest have neglected mine and since my ar- rival in this country I am informed that a process from a Mr. Taylor of Montreal is sent against Mr. Greverat. (Graverat) and unless I pursue some speedy remedy, I fear I shall be baﬂled to recover my Demand. I therefore beg your Excellency’s permission and assistance in forwarding lSee appendix.

[B 103, p 25] GEN. FREDERICK HALDIMAND TO BRIG. GEN. ALLAN MACLEAN Brig. Gen]. Maclean HEAD Quanmas QUEBEC Sm 10h Feby 1783. I have received your Letter of the 24th December last communicating your disappointment at the Return of the two Companies of the 34th Regt. and the Indian presents which had embarked for Detroit I cannot foresee any bad consequences from the former but the presents failing in their passage will, I fear be very distressing to the service at Detroit unless the Traders there should with the same readiness with those at Niagara lend to Major De Peyster a sufﬁcient quantity of goods to answer the present necessities of the Indians in all Events you will not fail to forward them by the very ﬁrst ship in the Spring. I approve much your expedient of Borrowing such goods from the Traders as were absolutely necessary for the Indians & not in the King’s Stores & I have given the necessary orders for their being replaced with the punctuality & precision you request. In respect to the assortment of the last supply sent to Niagara it is very probable that the state of the store here would not at that time afford a better indeed almost every article that remained in it was forwarded. Mom your account of Mr. Clencour I should rather sup- pose that we had lost the invoice, than that the goods had been sent without one for my orders respecting the forwarding of Indian Presents, under the care of an ofﬁcer, and with the utmost attention and regu- larity have always been so particular, that I cannot think Colonel Campbell would be deﬁcient in so essential a point. I shall however
Page 92
92 HALDIMAND PAPERS give such orders as will I hope in future prevent all neglects of that nation (nature). The Report of the Survey you ordered upon these goods speciﬁes The whole of the Indian‘presents well conditioned except three trunks of Lian that are wet. All the bales of canvas wet and partly damaged. . I am concerned to ﬁnd that three companies of the 34th Regt. with a supply of bedding were driven back to Carleton Island. I hope the former will arrive with you time enough in the Spring should they be wanted, and that you have been able as you proposed to borrow a sufﬁciency of Blankets from the Indian Department which you can replace on the arrival of the bedding as the blankets are of the same- size and quality. Your not having heard from Detroit gives every reason to believe that all is quiet there, for Major De Peyster could not have failed giving you immediate notice had any thing extraordi- nary occurred but as the season of the year is at hand when prepara- tions must be made if the Enemy intend to prosecute offensive meas ures against the Indians it will be of the last consequence that not only Major De Peyster should keep out intelligent and well directed scouts to protect every information possible of their designs & motions but that small parties of the Six Nations should be sent for the same purpose and it- would be right to send an Indian ofﬁcer or intelligent non-commissioned ofﬁcer with each to prevent the impositions, Indians seldom fail to make in their Report. for upon your having early 8: authentic intelligence every thing will depend, should you be obliged to oppose the enemy, and if otherwise much expence will be saved in unnecessary ﬁtting out war parties upon false alarms & reports. Should the enemy force us to take the ﬁeld in the Spring it must be recom— mended in the strongest manner to the Indians to act more conjointly than we have ever been able to persuade them to do, wavering & break- ing off in small parties as they have always done after any triﬂing suc- cess, will never have any material success. The three last campaigns have furnished diﬁerent instances in which opportunities were lost, by that conduct of entirely defeating Mr. Clarke & discouraging his fol- lowers from any future attempts against the Indian country. The Indians seem either not to know their own strength or by fatality to act in such manner as to render it ineﬁectual. Their ﬁrst attention should be to procure authentic intelligence so as to be able upon short notice to collect a body of Warriors equal to oppose the Force they expect to be attacked by. I do not mean equal in numbers for they ought to know that the advantages they have from their manner of
Page 93
GEN. HALDIMAND TO BRIG. GEN. MACLEAN 93 ﬂghting choice of ground &c. &c. over an enemy coming into their country, should equal a very small body of them to oppose almost any number. They must be strongly united and determined to support each other not to drop otf by three’s and four’s after taking a scalp or two. in short if they mean to defend their country vigorously and with success they must in some measure adopt our systems & be advised by oﬂicers of knowledge and experience who may be sent to conduct them. I am &c [signed] F. H. P. S. As there is every reason to think that the attendance of all oﬂicers & servants of the Crown in every departments will be necessary with their respective duties the ensuing Spring you will please not to give permission to any in the district of your command to leave them without the most pressing necessity should require it.

I have now the pleasure to inform you that Mr. Alex McKee Depy. Agent for the Shawanese Country is arrived here after leaving all things quiet—his delay was occasioned by some difﬁculty he found in persuading the Indians to return to their Village, which the conference some of the Chiefs held here with the Six Nations has also helped to bring about, by whom they were assured that Troops were on their way to assist the Shawanese if required. The prospect of a Reinforcement gives great conﬁdence to the Indians. but how necessary it will be for them to come on I cannot determine, till my Scouts return from the Neighbourhood of Fort Pitt, and as the Hope will much better accommodate the Troops than the Vessels now at Fort Erie, there will be full time for her arrival to bring them if wanted, or that you should have an Inclination to quarter them here to be in readiness. There are Fifty Cherokees arrived at the Wakato- makce Village, 27 of which are come on to Detroit and have brought Letters to Mr. McKee, an Extract of one of the Letters I herewith enclose, by which His Excellency the Commander in Chief will see that the Rebels had very formidable intentions against the Indian Country - in general. Another reason for sending off the Express is, that the papers required from Michilimakinac are just arrived here and a second Winter has set in after the River and even Lake Sinclair had been cleared of Ice.—-I have ordered Tucker to coast the Lake from long Point to Fort Erie in order to give you information respecting the Ice in that Quarter. , Brig.

I had the most positive orders from His Excellency General Haldi- mand. to restrain the Light Troops and Indians from any oﬁ'ensive War; and am happy to say I have succeeded to my wishes in obeying that order: at the same time I must do the Indians the Justice to declare that notwithstanding the very great provocation they have met with, they have implicitly followed the directions given them by me. through His Majesty’s Superintendant. agreeable. to the orders I had received, and that they committed no act of Hostility. except killing & scalping two men, within 40 miles of Fort Pitt, by three young Dela- ware Indians last February; they had been out some months hunting; and on their return they were discountenanced by me. by not being suffered to appear with their scalps. and sent oﬁ without receiving any one thing from the King’s Stores. besides being reprimanded by their Chiefs severely in presence of the Superintendant at my request; the greatest mortiﬁcation an Indian could meet with. They excused them- selves by saying they had been out & absent Hunting so long that they had not heard of their being restrained from every act of Hostility but they should do so no more.

Colonel Willet’s complaint therefore must have proceeded from this circumstance only, and of which he himself was the occasion.

I am however happy to have it in my power to inform Your Em-ellency. notwith- standing of what I had the honor to write you in my last Letters of the 1211 8; 13h Instant, that I have every reason to believe the Six Nations will act as they have hitherto done, with ﬁdelity, ﬁrmness & moderation; at least wlﬁle we remain here; but I would by no means answer for what they may do, when they see us evacuate these Posts, I should rather then be apprehensive of some disagreeable scenes ;-- This morning I had (at their own request) a conference with Six of the Principal Chiefs. Capt. Aron was the speaker. and he fully ex- plained to me his reasons for wishing to have an Interview with the Western Indians and convinced Colonel Butler and myself. that the Six Nations had no hostile views whatever against us or the Ameri- cans. The real fact is, as they say. that the Oneida Indians sent here by General Washington, had their relations here. one his mother, another his wife 8: a third his sister; before they went oﬂ’ they told their women that the Americans had resolved to destroy the Six Na- tions. together with the Delawares, Hurons and Shawauese. and also all the White People that served with the Indians, particularly Sir John Johnson 8: Colonel Butler; The Oneida Indians declare that all this was told them in a sett speech by Gen]. Schuyler when on their way here with General Washington‘s Letter. Your Excellency may believe, that I did not give implicit faith to so extraordinary a story that General Schulyer would express himself to such ignorant People in terms so harsh and cruel, whatever might be his private sentiments, or that he could wish, to commence or create fresh disputes or troubles to the American States on the Conclusion of a Peace, the Terms of which is certainly beyond their most sanguine hopes or expectations. But whether the story that has been propogated here by these Indians be true or false, it has made a very strong impression on the mind of the Six Nations: and I am clear the intention was to sett us at vari- ance with us. The Indians from the surmises they have heard of the Boundaries, look upon our conduct to them as treacherous and cruel; they told me they never could believe that our King could pretend to cede to America what was not his own to give. or that the Americans would accept from him what he had no right to grant. That upon a representation from the Six Nations in the year 1768, the King had appointed Sir \Villiam Johnson as Commissioner to settle the bound- aries between the Indians and the Colonies, That a line had been

That if it was really true that the English had basely betrayed them by pretending to give up their Country to the Americans without their consent. or consulting them. it Was an act of cruelty and injustice that Christians only were capable of doing. that the Indians were incapable of acting so; to friends or Allies, but that they did not believe we had sold 8; betrayed them.

Uncertain when I shall receive Instructions from Home upon this interesting subject and ﬁnding that the Indians are become very impatient of and discontented with their present situation, and as I am informed by Joseph they are in daily expectation of receiving Proposals from the United States, I have come to a resolution to send oif Major Holland, the Surveyor General. to (‘ataraqui to examine that Place and Country upwards. and if he should ﬁnd them favorable to my view, He is to make application at Carleton Island for assistance to make a Beginning. He goes properly prepared. in every respect for this business and altho’ other Duty will Oblige Him to return before it can be accom~ plished.

I wish you without delay. to proceed to Niagara to quiet the apprehensions of the Indians. by convincing them that it is not the Intention of Government to abandon them to the Resentment of the Americans. Joseph will deliver to you my answer to the Speech He brought in behalf of the Six Nations, which you will please to communi 'ate to them on your arri 'al at Niagara, with whatever speech may be proper from yourself upon the occasion. Upon Reconsidera- tion of Joseph's Speech by Him 8: Co]. Claus, they have made some alterations which the Colonel will connnunicate to you.

SIR I am honored with your Letter of the 18h Inst. inclosing a letter from Mr. McKee the Indian Superintendent to Major “'all commandant of Fort Neilson,‘ which I shall transmit to the commander in chief— I had a Letter from His Excellency the Commander in Chief dated 26th May, acquainting me Sir John Johnson was coming up immedi- ately to quiet the minds of the Indians, and I dare say he will bring up such supplies of cloathing as will answer every reasonable demand that the Indians ought to have, and such as will acquit us very hon- 'orably to them for what is due. There cannot be a doubt but the Indians will know the Boundaries, for we have plenty of People amongst us, that are sufﬁciently oﬂicious and vicious to do all the mis- chief they can. “'e have some of them here, and it would be very surprizing if you had not people of the same stamp at Detroit. You certainly must be a much better judge than me of the proper method of managing the Indians, and of the propriety of calling a Council of four chiefs of each Nation to meet at Detroit; I own that I have followed a different method, for I send oﬂicers to the different nations advising them to pay no attention to any stories from bad birds, only to _mind the messages sent them from here—that at present we could only tell them, Peace was made, but how soon we had the particulars from authority we should call them together, and let them know the Particulars, and I pressed it very much upon them to mind their planting and Fishing in the mean time, and I am not without my apprehensions but that you will ﬁnd those Chiefs attended by such a numerous suite, as will make the visit expensive and troublesome, besides, at present, we have not information sufﬁcient to give the par- ticulars, only to assure them the King 8: the Commander in Chief will take care of them, and when we are properly informed and authorized, we must call them together again: under those circumstances every expence incurred now, is so much lost. I was so. much on my guard, that to prevent councils, I sent Indian ofﬁcers with some Rum to the different nations to prevent their meeting here—I only mention these particulars to you for your consideration: knowing well from your experience that you are much more au fait with respect to the Indians that I can possibly be, and convinced you will do every thing for the best. Whither or not Sir John will go to Detroit I know not. if its neces- sary no doubt he will—be assured the Commander in Chief will concert 1 Fort Nelson .

Sm Its scarcely possible for me to know, how to behave with our designing hipocritical neighbors the Americans they are eternally send- ing messages and private emissaries amongst our Indians. Last night late Colonel Butler came to me, and told me that Capt.

Colonel Butler and myself are of opinion if there are any white men among them, to get the consent of the Chiefs to bring them in here, and send them to be kept at Carleton Island, till we hear from Your Excellency, to send the Indians back, and send an Escort with them at some distance from our frontiers, telling them that they are not to come among our Indians, without having the sanction of your Excellency, & Congress, and when that is the case, we shall be glad to see them should they be all Indians we shall send them all back. These Sir are the ideas that have occur’d to Colonel Butler and myself, and we are in hopes they will meet with your Excellency’s approbation. . The Americans no doubt will say that they cannot prevent their Indians, coming to see our Indians, but this is all a farce, if they had not some sinister design, they would in an open and Public manner let your Excellency know their intention with respect to the Indians. I shall request to have your Excellencies directions on this head, that I may act accordingly.

[B 105. p 403] JACOB SCHIEFF'ELIN’S MEMORIAL TO BRIG. GEN. ALLAN MACLEAN To Brigadier General McLean commanding the Upper Posts &c. 8:0. 8:0. The Memorial of Jacob Schielfelin1 Lieutenant of the Detroit Volun- teers and Secretary to the Indian Dept. Your memorialist having been appointed since June 1777 a ﬁrst Lieutenant of Detroit Volunteers, and continued as such ever since. having accompanied Lieut Gov. Hamilton to St. Vincennes where he. your memorialist, was made a Prisoner and carried to Williamsburg Prison in Virginia, and suffered a most rigorous conﬁnement untill he effected his escape from thence and got to New York, at which place His Excellency Sir Henry Clinton appointed him to act as Lieut to the Queen‘s Rangers until your memorialist could have conveyance to Quebec which was in September 1780. On his arrival there. His Excellency General Haldimand was pleased to continue your Memorial- ist in pay as Lieut of the Detroit Volunteers altho’ the men were no longer in existence as soldiers, and recommended him for his former otiice of secretary, should such be necessary. Your memorialist on the 28h October 1780 left Quebec with two Letters from His Excelly. the Commander in Chief, to the Commanding Oﬂicer of Detroit one of which was under cover, with a ﬂying seal. to your Predecessor General Powell as they so nearly concerned your metuorialist he could wish that you had seen them. Your memorialist having when at Quebec- 1 See appendix.

136 HALDIMAND PAPERS applied for an allowance of Bat and Forage from the time he went on service, but as none of the new Levies had received any, as he was told at Head quarters. he could not then expect it, since your memor- ialist arrived here, Capt Lamoth of the same corps came round from New York having received Bat 8r. Forage as Captain of the Detroit Volunteers by virtue of Sir Henry Clinton‘s Order through his Adjt. General Major Delancey and even draws it here from time to time which is pass’d in the Public Accounts by order of the Commanding Ofﬁcer. Your memorialist having applied to the commanding ofﬁcer for his Proportion as a subaltern appointed by the same authority in that corps, to which application your memorialist received for answer that Capt. Lamothe had been on service in the Indian country since he came up last and that your memorialist acted as Secretary here, therefore could not have it; that he had also particular Instructions ‘with regard to Captain Lamothe from the Brig. General. Your Memorialist receives his pay as Lieutenant by order of His Excellency the Commander in Chief and was continued in his oﬂice as secretary, he has been twice ordered into the Indian Country since he returned, as can be made to appear by the written Instructions in his possession. Your memorialist cannot conceive that altho’ he acts as secretary he ought to lose any advantage he is entitled to as Lieut. which it is his Excellency's pleasure he should continue as such. Your memorialist therefore with great submission, Requests that you will take his case and long services, into consideration, and as he is equally entitled with his Captain to his proportion as Lieut, he humbly submits to your Justice the propriety of his claim. In reliance on which, your memorialist has the honor to be _ with great Respect Your most obedient Humble Servant Detroit July 6h 1783. J. SCHEFFELIN [B 103, p 262] MAJOR ARENT S. DE PEYSTER TO BRIG.

Caldwell is ordered to repair to Niagara, with the Evidence for himself and Lieut Turney. Some of them cannot well spare, but the Captain thinks them absolutely necessary. Simon Girty a Principal Evidence, is too ill to proceed to Niagara.

MAJ. DE PEYSTER TO GEN. MACLEAN 137 The General order you sent me I received I shall dispatch my Indians to morrow, provided the Gage does not arrive this day with ﬁnal orders 8: Instructions. Believe me, Sir, I shall be aware of accumulating expences; on the contrary, I did believe and am still of opinion that the few Indians called together at present will prevent numbers from coming in, that would otherwise have pretended ignorance of what was doing. The Chiefs are very thinly accompanied most of the Indians being out Hunting. Those come in, are the principals, who otherwise would have been spoken with by two Deputies from congress, who Mr. Elliott met within a few miles of this Place on their direct road hither. These Sir, are Mr. Douglas and Captain McCuily,1 mentioned in the dispatch I lately sent you. Mr. Douglas appears to be a shrewd sensible man, his companion rather more open— both genteel men. They delivered me a letter directed to the oﬁicer commanding His Britannic Majesty’s Forces at Detroit. This letter is nearly a direct copy of the one sent you from General Lincoln dated at Philadelphia 3rd May 1783, I observed to Mr. Douglas that the subject of General Lincoln’s Letter should be by me communicated to the Indians—They however have been long since restrained from going to war by orders from His Excellency the Commander in Chief—Then Mr. Douglas shewed me his Instructions which are of such a nature that I can by no means admit of their being delivered to the Indians here. where His Excellency’s ﬁnal orders are not yet arrived. I observed that as Commandant of Detroit, I was yet uninformed that the Posts were to be given up, or how the line was to strike. He then observed that Congress took it for granted that I had received my orders before now. I have made these gentlemen sensible that the Indians in the vicinity of Detroit will (even should the Post be given up) fall on the other side. That therefore they cannot listen to them, and that the Deiawares, Shawanese, W'iandotts, Mingoes &c will never act but with the concurrence of the Six Nations, on whose determina- tion Peace or War with those Indians will much depend, and as the business they are come upon is of a very delicate nature I advise them to wait upon you at Niagara, where they may also have the chance to meet with the Superintendent Genl. and Inspector General of Indian Affairs, which they have agreed to, and I have allowed their guide to return to Fort Piitt, lest the People there should be alarmed at their being detained.

138 HALDIMAND PAPERS MAJOR ARENT S. DE I'EYSTER Tl) BRIG. GEN. ALLAN MACLEAN DETROIT 7th July 1783. Sin Now that the Missionaries‘ from Congress are embarked and on the point of their departure, I will mention a word to you in Private. I have shewn them every civility consistent with my duty. during their stay at this place—and I have great reason (from the cheerful appearance in the countenances of many as well as their expressions, and the odd notions put into the heads of the Indians) to be happy that they are embarked. Perhaps you may think it best they may return by Lake Champlain. but in case it should be otherwise. I will be glad of your particular directions how you wish I should behave to them on their return here. However great Enthusiasts (those Missionaries as they call them- selves) may be. and however willing to risk martyrdom in the Amer- ican cause, still it would bring an eternal slur upon me. should any drunken Indian, or any one whose suﬁ'ering have been too great to have allowed him to listen to my council, do them an ill turn. consid- ering the vast tract of country betwixt this and Fort Pitt, besides on the other hand they would have an opportunity of delivering their message to the Indians, which they were prevented doing on their way hither by reason of the Chiefs being on their way to Detroit—— That the intent of their Journey is known amongst the Indians. I make no doubt, but as it could not be signiﬁed in form, and answers received, they are not much advanced, and matters may still remain doubtful. You, Sir. are the properest judge of this affair, and I sine cerer wish the steps I have taken may meet with your approbation-— Detroit is by no means a place for American Deputies to reside in until His Excellency’s ﬁnal orders are received.

BRIG. GEN. MACLEAN TO LT. COL. DE PEYSTER 139 of a Letter from Ephraim Douglas to Capt. Elliott of the Indian Dept—Ephraim is a suspicious name, I therefore am glad you have sent to bring him in to Detroit. for we really cannot be too much on our guard against these designing knaves, for I do not believe the world ever produced a more deceitful or dangerous set of men than the Americans: and now they are become such Arch-Politicians by eight years practice, that were old Matchioavell alive, he might go to school to the Americans to learn Politics more crooked than his own; we therefore cannot be too cautious. It is something very extraordinary that Mr. Douglas should attempt to assemble the Indians under your nose, and even write for one of your own principal Indian Managers to come 8: write wait upon him with one of your Interpreters. without taking the least notice of you. I should apprehend his ﬁrst step ought to have been to come to Detroit and produce his Credentials to you. The Americans being now Independent States will say. they have a right to send Ambassadors or Emmissaries to whom they please. with- out our consent—no doubt they may to all nations that we know of but in the present case, with respect to our Indians, I am of a differ- ent opinion, it being clearly an exception to the Rule—The Indians get this day from the King’s Stores the bread they are to eat to mor- row, and from his magazines the clothing that covers their nakedness; in short, they are not only our allies, but they are a part of our Family; and the Americans might as well (while we are in possession of these Posts) attempt to seduce our children 8: servants from their duty and allegiance, as to convene and assemble all the Indian Nations, without ﬁrst communicating their intentions to His Majesty’s Repre‘ sentative in Canada—These are my sentiments, and I shall not alter them till I am otherwise instructed by the Commander in Chief; and if any such person as Ephraim Douglas comes to assemble the Six Nations I shall certainly bring him in here 8:. keep him till I 'send for Instructions to General Haldimand. Mr. Douglas must be a curious fellow truly, in writing to Capt. Elliot that he may assure the Indians, that they have received from any other Quarter, but through him is without the sanction or author- ity of the United States—He does not know then, that I had a Letter from General Washington on that subject, and another Letter from General Lincoln President of the Board of War of the United States,

ALLAN MACLEAN TO GEN FREDERICK HALDIMAND NIAGARA 9h July 1783. SIR Herewith I have the honor to transmit to your Excellency the copy of a Letter I received from Major Depeyster together with the copy of a Letter wrote by one Ephriam Douglas, Mr. Douglas’s Letter explains itself so fully that I need not trouble your Excellency by saying anything about it. I wrote to Major Depeyster yesterday on the subject of Mr. Douglass mission, and I herewith enclose a copy of my letter to Major Depeyster for your Excellency’s Perusall, in hopes that you may approve of my sentiments on the subject; but that if on the contrary you should disapprove of my ideas that you will send me instructions how to act, for I really confess the present conduct of the Americans is very new to me, and that I am at a loss how to treat people that act in so uncommon a manner, at the same time, I am fully determined to act in the manner I have mentioned to Major Depeyster, till I have the good fortune to receive your Excellency’s farther orders how I am to act with this impudent people. There is little doubt but the Delaware Indians that came to Cadaragows, are come at the request of Mr. Ephriam Douglas—at least I suspect that to be the case. I have the honor to be with great respect Your Excellencys most obedient and General Haldimand Most Humble Servant Endorsed: From 1783. B. Genl. Maclean 9h July Reed 16h Approved. [B 103, p 254]

The Congress of the United States having instructed me to make the proper arrangements with the Commanders in Chief of the British Forces in America, for receiving possession of the Posts of the United States occupied by the Troops of His Brittanic Majesty and from which His Majesty’s Troops are to be withdrawn, agreeably to the 7h article of the Provisional Treaty—I have to inform Your Excell- ency, that I have desired Major General the Baron de Steuben1 who 'will have the honor to deliver this Letter, to proceed for that purpose into Canada, and I have fully empowered and authorized him to form every arrangement with Your Excellency which may be found necessary for receiving possession of the Posts & Fortresses in the North Western Frontier of the Territory of the United States, under your direction, and I beg you to be persuaded that whatever agreements this ofﬁcer shall form with Your Excellency respecting this Business, will be punctually observed on the part of the United States. Baron Steuben is instructed to visit the Posts within the Boundary of the United States upon the River St. Lawrence and the Lakes above, & to report to me his opinion of the measure necessary for the Garrisons & support of them. In this tour and in the execution of this business, I ﬂatter myself he will receive the necessary Passport from Your Excellency & derive such aid as will enable him to fulﬁl the objects of his commission. As a Foreigner & an ofﬁcer of Rank & reputation, I beg leave to recommend the Baron to Your Excellency’s particular notice & attention—— As a gentleman you will ﬁnd him every way worthy of your civilities.

Sm You no doubt long before this have rec‘1 all the papers relating Lt Governor Sinclair-s Transactions at this place with me. I hope they have been of Service in regard of getting the Bills settled, I have always expected that His Excellency would be Pleased to consider that I have been paying off all the People employed in the King’s Works at this Place since my arrival lending for government goods Rum and any thing that was wanting I had either had or could borrow, the dry goods I lent last year, I have had returned, the last of them By the King‘s Canoes this spring, But still the Rum Remains due as well as every shilling I have advanced for government since my arrival at this Post unless Capt. Robertson’s Bills are paid, which we have no accounts of as yett, His Excellency must think that such an advance as I must be in at present on this account must certainly Ruin me, even if the Principal is paid, for not being a man of fortune, must certainly pay Interest to those that supports me, & to add to this the Damages on all the Bills Protested. I am certain, you have not neglected repre- senting this to His Excellency, 8: I am hopeful he will be pleased to take my case into consideration and not suffer me to be for ever ruined I am Sir Your most 0b. hu.

BRIG. GEN. MACLEAN TO CAPT. MATHEWS 143 Major Ancrum reports the Pickets of Fort Erie to be so rotten a state. that he expects to be laid quite open soon, I have desired him to support them in the best manner he can untill I have Your Excel- lency‘s orders respecting that Fort. The Batteaux for transporting Provisions, and goods, to Fort Erie, are also in such bad order, that they keep workmen constantly imployed in repairing them. unless a fresh supply of boats is sent up in a short time, there will be no possibility of transporting the goods. The Detachment of Rangers under Captain Caldwell is arrived from Detroit—they make a demand of pay for the extra duty from the 2411 June; I have put them off until I have your Excellency‘s orders. It will be some time before the Detachment of the 84h arrives from Michilimackinac. as, the vessel sent to fetch them down returned to Detroit empty, and a letter from Capt. Robertson informs me that he will send the Detachment when he can relieve some of the men that are at the work at Tessalon,1 I am as yet ignorant for what purpose they are there, it being too far off either to cut wood or bay. for the Garrison of Michilimackinac. The inclosed Deed. the Indians obliged Mr. Jacob Schieﬁelin2 to deliver into my hands, which they said in Council, he had obtained from some of their Chiefs in an unwarrantable manner.

The day after my return I did myself the honor of writing when I had not time to thank you for the good ofﬁces in mentioning me to your friends in the Upper Posts, which has been the means to facili- tate my business; their friendly attention puts me under every obliga- tion—your friend the commandt at Detroit made me one of his family during my stay & passed the time very agreeable—I found it necessary to proceed to Makina to receive a payment that could not be effected at Detroit, while there Capt. Robertson paid me every attention 8: I am only mortifyd that their happy situation and good harmony will be too soon disturbed our allies the natives are alarmed at the sacriﬁce made of them. I mention’d in my last that I found here my friends Messrs Glens on a visit by whom I learn that the generality of the country are not pleased with their Independence & the moderate apprehend the evils that must unavoidably ensue, these gentlemen intend to return to morrow & this morn. I called with them at Brigadier St Legers for his pass port whom replyed that he was not authorized to grant any but he supposed there would be not difﬁculty for them to proceed, as they had entered by His Excellency’s permission on the footing of visitors to return again, but to avoid delay in. case they might be stopped, I beg that you will please to solicit His Excellency’s permis- sion to signify the same pr ﬁrst post to the commanding ofﬁcer at the out posts.

146 HALDIMAND PAPERS Runers are just come in from the Indian Country with accounts that the Kentuck People had attacked & carried off a number of Horses belonging to the Indian Hunters, who were hunting on their own grounds on this side the Ohio. The Indians not willing to loose their Property, pursued the Virginians, attacked them 8.: killed three men, and had one of their indians mortally wounded. I have made every possible inquiry, and can assure you, that the Kentuckers were the sole aggressors, and I have mentioned the par- ticulars, that they may be candidly related to prevent misrepresenta- tions, and the bad consequences that might insue by the Lawless pro- ceedings of the People at Kentuck, the Indians being disposed to Peace & Friendly Treaty with the People on the Frontiers of the United States. It is lucky that Shirlock has reached home before this happened; To-morrow I am to be cursed with a visit from seventy Cherokees & other Southern Indians amounting to two hundred who I am told bring Letters from St. Augustine. It is said that at their departure war reigned in'that quarter more than ever, so that I sup- pose they must have been several months on the road; what to do with these Gentry I know not. They will look very black at my empty hands after coming from such a distance.

I had some conversation with Mr. Douglass, and he candidly confessed, that part of his instructions had much better been omitted; I had almost told him they were insolent; but I thought it was best to be moderate. Mr Douglass 8; his companion Capt. McCully left this on the 16h at one o’clock, at Twelve I received a Letter from him, and at one I sent him an answer; copy of his Letter with my answer.

GENTLEMEN, In consequence of a memorial I presented to His Excellency the Governor 8: the Council of Virginia, I understood from His Excellency that the Delegates in Congress from that state were in- structed to move Congress to make application 8; require restitution from the British Commander in Chief in Canada 8: New York of all Papers belonging to the citizens of America which during the War fell into the hands of the British 8: if Congress did not choose to make such Demand then the Virginia Delegates were to apply for their own. His Excellency directed me to give in a schedule of mine but I was so hurry’d whilst at Richmond that I neglected so to do, it is now more convenient for me to send immediately to Congress than Vir- ginia, I therefore take the liberty of troubling you with the Inclosed and hope it will not arrive too late. I have already suffered great loss & many severity’s by the Enemy and should it so happen that I fail in retrieving these papers great damage may accrue. you can easily perceive by the nature of them the importance of them to me, and I trust it is unnecessary to press you on the subject and am most respectfully Gentlemen Your obedient most Humble Servant JOHN CAMPBELL In case any part or the whole of these papers should reach you be so good as to give them to James Milligan Esq.

Children: I am very sorry to be obliged to assemble you here upon a dis- agreeable subject, having been informed that, notwithstanding the strictest injunctions and your Promises not to attack the americans, that some of your People spilt blood, I desire to know from you every circumstance that I may give you my sentiments thereon. The Snake, a Shawaneese then said Father: A Party of the Chi, li ca, thi, ki. Village went out to hunt four of them being here present, declare, “that while hunting, on this side of the Ohio, about 30 miles from their village their Horses were taken away from their camp at night, that the Chief ﬁnding that their Horses were taken away resolved, with his men to follow their tracks. after recollecting that one Sherlock came lately to them from the Virgin- ians with propositions of Amity and agreed that Hostilities should cease while both parties remained un-molested, the chief said to his young men, those who have taken our Horses are no Virginians. for after the agreement made between us, we could not believe that they were of that People, we therefore continued to follow their tracks to the Ohio and overtook them, we discovered two men who were painted and in poSsession of our Horses, upon which we ﬁr’d, killed one and called to the other to surrender, which he refused to do, and at the same time level’d his piece upon one of the Indians who received his shot thro’ his shirt, the Indian ﬁring the same time killed him. The chief then desired his young men who had crossed the Rocky River with him to look out and endeavour to meet with Sherlock who had come among them with a ﬂag, as he wished to tell him what had pass’d and that his People have not kept their word but when we came to the place where he was to pass. we found he had already pass’d it, on which we concluded to report the circumstances to our Father as
Page 154
154 HALDIMAND PAPERS soon as we had ﬁnished our hunt, this affair happened about the 10h June. Lieut Col. De I’eyster then said Children! I am extremely sorry that this affair has happened and much more that you did not take the two new Prisoners and bring them in to this place, if you had, it would have told greatly in favour of your nation and would not only show that you are attentive to the orders lately sent to you from your Father, but were able to set an example to your enemies, I own its very hard to have your property taken away, but the times are very Critical the World wants to be at Peace 8: its time they should be so, but I fear this affair will bring on bad consequences, if so, it must be an affair of your own, as your Father can take no part in it, let me recommend to you, in case a similar affair should happen, “that you will spill no more blood, for depend upon it wherever blood is shed there will be retaliation. when I ﬁrst heard about this matter, I communicated it to the General at Niagara, who writes me word that the Six Nations are extremely sorry for it, and you may be assured that you will soon hear from them upon the subject. Children! These things I beg may be convey’d thro’ the Indian Country (delivers several Strings) that I once more request of them not to put themselves in the way of such accidents 8: in case an enemy come to molest them, as they can be but a few runagades they had much better take them alive and bring them in, for when matters are quite settled, you may depend upon their being punished severely by their own Laws, this request is upon your account, for as your Father has already made Peace with the Americans, I repeat to you again, he is bound in honor to keep Peace and can aﬁord you no assistance if you foolishly bring mischief upon yourselves.

The Faith is arrived with the Indian Presents which are now unloading and have the appearance of having been pillaged. A survey will determine what has been stolen to those who may have the account of what is sent I have neither received Letter or Invoice relative to them. (Every possible enquiry has been made for the Prisoners mentioned in Mr. Douglas’s list, but to no etfect—so that they must have been taken by the Cherokees before the order for restraining the Indians reached them. E. (I have also spoken with Indians who were personally concern’d in the late alfair when their Horses were stolen by the Virginians—— The inclosed is a copy of what passed upon the occasion, to which they then made no reply, but have since declared that they thought it hard their proceedings should be found fault with as they knew no reason why they should expose their lives in endeavouring to take Armed Robbers prisoners—One of the men they nevertheless summoned to surrender and he answered them 'by pulling a trigger. The Inter- preters with the principal chief of the Shawanese are gone off with Belts and strings to endeavour to ﬁnd the hunting parties on the Banks of the Ohio and communicate your sentiments to them.) It would be in vain for Mr. McKee to attempt to assemble them at any given place at present, and he will be absolutely required here on receipt of Sir John Johnson’s further Instructions, which assuredly must arrive by the ﬁrst Vessels, as he knows we cannot proceed ’till we hear from him. and he must before now have determined something with the Six Nations. I fear whilst the Hatchet remains in the hands of the Indians that they will not altogether pay strict regard to our injunctions—as yet you know we have only advised them to sit still &c, but the solemn business of burying the Hatchet is to follow—we have the goods, but must wait the orders. I am surprized not to have had one line from the Superintendent General, as I wrote to him on receipt of his Instructions which were directed to the Ofﬁcer Commanding the Indian Department at Detroit. Sir John knows the Business has always been carried on by the Com- manding Ofﬁcer of the Post at Detroit as well as )Iichilimackinac—I therefore urged the necessity of some one being by him appointed to the office. Mr. McKee is Deputy Agent for the Shawanese Country by the appointment of Sir Wm. Johnson. and Mr. Duperon Baby acts by

Your Excellency may easily Believe, that allowing them to proceed on that Bussiness without your orders & approbation 'as what I could not permit on any

BRIG. GEN. MACLEAN TO GEN. HALDIMAND 159 account—Indeed as Major Ross was at Oswego when they passed, I am at a Loss to guess why he did not stop them there, and report them to Your Excellency without permitting them to Proceed to this Place, Here they now are, and here they shall remain till I have the honor of receiving your commands about them; I have ordered their ' Liquors to be put into a place of security in the mean time. I cer- tainly would have ordered them to return back immediately, but that I was afraid it might be looked upon as an act of violence in me, as Major Ross allowed them to come here, But I explained to them; how improper it was in them; to come to trade here so soon, Even before the Deﬁnitive treaty of Peace was signed, or before the commercial Treaty had been ratiﬁed and concluded, that what was still stronger that no British Merchant could come here, without having ﬁrst obtain- ed a regular Permission from your Excellency, under certain conditions & restrictions, that such being the case, the only, and the greatest favour I could grant them; was to let them remain here, and that I was doubtful how far I might be justiﬁed to your Excellency, in per- mitting them to remain here, but that I would wish it, in order to convince them, that our humanity, good nature and forbearance, was greatly superior to their own, as they were daily forming resolves, threatening with death any of our People that should come amongst them. They told me that they really did not come to Trade, had only brought a few Liquors with them, that their Chief Errant was, to try and recover sums due to them at Detroit since the 1775; I however see by their Papers, that they were to proceed to Mackina, in case they did not sell their goods at some intermediate Post between this place and Makina. I am therefore to request that your Excellency will have the goodness to let me know by the earliest opportunity what I am to do in this Bussines, that I may act accordingly—and this I request the more anxiously, as I understand that a number of other Boats were Preparing at Schenectady to come here, In the mean time I have taken it upon me, to direct the commanding ofﬁcer at Oswego to stop all such Boats till I should be honored with your Excellency’s com- mands about them— or till he should receive orders from Head Quarters on that subject. I have the honor to be most respectfully Your Excellency’s most obedient & most Humble Servant General Haldimand ALLAN Macme

As Sir John sends a canoe off to day to go with a message to the Oneida Village, I directed one of the Principal men come here from Schenectady to write to his friends below, to stop all other boats from coming here, untill this matter is properly settled and understood, which can only be done by applying to Your Excellency for what Purpose this intelligence I hope will have the desired effect on these wrong headed insolent People.

Depeyster in his Letter of the 24h July says that the deﬁciency of Flour to compleat the Upper Posts may be purchased at Detroit, I have wrote to him last week desiring him to let me know for Your Excellency’s information what ﬂour sold at per hundred weight at Detroit, and that in case it was reasonable, it was Possible that you might order some to be purchased, how soon I have his answer I shall transmit it to your Excellency. In some of my former Letters I had the honor to mention the manner in which Indian Presents were sent in from Canada, Sir John Johnson being here, I had no right to Enquire, but your Excellency will see that Lieut Colonel Depeyster complains of his not receiving Letter or Invoice, and that the goods appear to have been plundered; all I can say is, that we could not get from the Indian Department any Lists or return of the number of Bails, Barrels or Packages sent to Detroit and on that account, that no Regular Pass could be made out as usual, which puts it out of my Power to give Lieut Col. Depeyster any kind of information, the Gentleman that had the charge of the Indian Presents is now gone to Detroit, and its to be hoped he will be able to clear it up, why he did not go with the goods I cannot say. In spite of all my efforts I am' sorry to inform your Excellency that there has been a much larger quantity of Rum expended than I could

I was very glad that Colonel Buttler made this Proposal as it will prevent their coming here, and save a quantity of Provisions. Colonel Buttler carried two of his own People with him, that he can depend upon, to leave in that country, to this Proposal I consented only untill your Excellency’s farther Pleasure should be known which I request I may have soon, I also request that you may be pleased to signify to me for my guidance what may be thought a reasonable quantity of Rum monthly for the Six Nations for it appears to me that the People at the Head of Indian Department seem to vie with each other who shall expend most Rum & the great Chiefs are striving who shall drink most Rum I have the honor herewith to send Your Excellency a Return of the Number of People in the Indian Dept. drawing Provisions at this Post the number of Ofﬁcers is 23, and 13 forresters in all 36, their families 8: servants amounts 62, a coppy of this Return I gave to Sir John Johnson when here—40 chiefs and warriors of the Six Nations are going to Detroit to morrow in order to meet the Creeks & Chero~ kees &c and to form a treaty of alliance & friendship together, this was settled by Sir John Johnson when here, Mr. Dease & another Indian oﬂicer goes with them.

164 HALDIMAND PAPERS SIR JOHN JOHNSON TO GEN. FREDERICK HALDIMAXD MONTREAL 11th August Sin 1783. I have the honor to transmit herewith the Proceedings of the several meetings held with the Six Nations &c at Niagara, and with the Mes- sasagas at Carleton Island, by the latter your Excellency will observe that some uneasiness has arisen among them in consequence of a Report prevailing that a number of the Six Nations intend Settling in the Neighborhood of Cataraqui they seem to have no objection to White People settling there, but say that if their Brothers the Six Nations come there they are so numerous, they will overrun their hunting grounds and oblige them to retire to new & distant grounds not so good or convenient to them, these objections how r may easily be removed by a purchase of such part of their country as your Excellency may think necessary for the use of the Mohawks and others who may wish to establish themselves on that side of the Lake. I should imagine a purchase of the lands including the Islands from the Bay of Kenty downwards, and including the Crown Lands, would be sufﬁcient to answer every purpose both for Loyalists and Indians. I beg leave to request that as the ofﬁcers and men of my Regiment were the foremost in opposing His Majesty’s Enemies and the ﬁrst that joined hi Forces in this Province, they may be indulged with the ﬁrst choice of Lands, should any be granted to them as they have had reason to expect from the Proclamation Issued at the commence- ment of the war. Captain Brant, John Isaac and a number of other Deputies from the Six Nations accompanied by Lieut Colonel Butler, or Mr Dease1 were to set off for Detroit soon after I left Niagara to meet the Cherokees, Greeks and Western Indians assembled there in order to communicate what had passed at Niagara, and to strengthen their confederacy by a union of all the nations. Major Scott having been with me on my Tour, and being well informed of everything relative to the situation, disposition and Temper the Indians are in at present, as well as of many particulars relative to the Posts &c begs leave to offer his service (hould Your Excellency think it necessary) to be the bearer of any report you may think proper to make to His Majesty’s Minister on this occasion, and as there is little service for him to be employed in at present. and it may 'John Dense Ind.

And also acquainting me that the Baron is charged with Instructions from your Excellency to visit the Posts within the Boundary of the United States upon the River St. Lawrence and the Lakes above, for the purpose of having a report made to you of the measures necessary for the Garrisoning & support of them. In answer to Your Excellency’s Letter, I beg leave to assure you, Sir, that few things would afford me greater pleasure than to manifest my Readiness to comply with Your Excellency’s wishes, as far as it is consistent with my Duty, persuaded that Your Excellency does not expect I should do more. I proceed to acquaint you that His Majesty’s Proclamation declaring a cessation of Hostilities with the Powers at \Var—& particular orders to comply with it, are the only Instructions I have as yet received upon the important subject of Peace. Thus situated a strict observance of my duty & of the rules of war practiced by all nations, leaves me no alternative but that of deferring a compliance with your Requests until I shall be properly authorized

As the Baron will communicate to your Excellency the substance of our conversation upon the subject of his commission I shall add no more here than to assure your Excellency that every measure which obedience to the commands of my Sovereign & ‘the most Humane Inclination could sugget, 8: which the indefatigible endeavours of my ofﬁcers serving in the Upper Country & the Force of Plresents could effect, has been unwearie'dly employed in restraining the Indians and reconciling them to Peace, and it is with sincere Pleasure I acquaint Your Excellency that my efforts have been compleatly successful, not- withstanding the hostile attempts which have been made against the upper Country, long after their happy effects had been experienced upon the frontiers.

Every object of Dispute between Great Britain and the United States of America is done away by the Articles which were signed on

The Reciprocal Delivery of Prisoners, the recalling the Auxiliary Troops, the arrangements for the evacuation of New York. 8: the com- munication which is opened between us and the British Posts in that state all prove that the Court of Great Britain considered the articles above mentioned as deﬁnitive 8: unchangeable. The United States of America wish to establish a perfect harmony with Great Britain by making good every engagement on her part 8.: at the same time they have a right to expect that eyery promise which has been made on the part of Great Britain will be fulﬁlled. ' A delivery of the Posts within the limits of the United States now occupied by the British is promised in the articles before mentioned— this at present I am not instructed to insist on, but I am ordered to demand of your Excellency a safe conduct to, & the liberty of visiting them, that I may be able to make such arrangement for the interest of the United States as may be necessary when they shall be delivered up. To this Demand I beg Your Excellency will please to give a late General Answer.

Sm For His Excellency’s Information I have the honor to transmit here- with, a Letter I received from Messrs Hamilton & Cartwright, and in justice to these gentlemen I do assure you that every word contained in their Letter is matter of fact, and that they could last march have sold all the Rum that they Lent government wholesale at 20 1 per gallon and that by receiving now the same quantity of Rum they must be very great sufferers, but from this Hardship its out of my power to relieve them, for should His Excellency not approve of pay- ing them in cash for the 500 gallons they lent to Major Ross at Oswego last Spring, and which is now due to them, I am of opinion that it would be an act of justice done them, to let them have an additional quantity of rum to make up for a small part of the loss they must be at at the present price of Rum here, it being fallen from 24 | York to 16 | York currency. It is also an act of justice I owe to Messrs Hamilton & Cartwright to say that they have always been the foremost in giving the lead by lending to Government everything in their house whether Dry Goods or Liquors—upon all occasions. ‘ I have had no small Plague with supporting Mr. Douglas in his Exclusive Priviledge of Retailing Rum; the other merchants endeavour- ing to hurt him, I therefore this day gave out an order about it, which I shall take care to see executed agreeable to the Commander in Chiefs orders, renewed to me by your Letter of the 10h last April, The great cry was from the ofﬁcers complaining that Douglas & Livingston sold their Rum higher than it could be got from others, and that they apprehended, that in the Exclusive Priviledge His Excellency did not mean that Douglas was not to sell his Rum at as low a Price as other People, in this I agreed with them, and sent for Douglas, and told him he must sell his Rum at the market Price, and he told me he would do so most willingly, the merchants were called together, and the Price in retail ﬁxed at 16 | York Currency, After this agreement I received a Letter from Mr. Street, copy of which I enclose for His Excellency’s Perusal, but as Mr. Streetl must know that he could not be permitted to retail to the garrison, the drift of the Letter must be to hurt Douglas, I have made no answer to Mr. Street, If the merchants really mean to lower the price of Rum to twelve shillings they ought to apply in a body, to desire that lSamuel Street, a trader at Niagara.
Page 170
170 HALDIMAND PAPERS the Market Price of Rum might be twelve shillings for I have nothing to do with the Prices they will sell their goods or Liquors at, that is no part of my Business, Only that I apprehend that should the merchants in general at this Post bring the market Price of Rum to twelve shillings that Douglas, will be under the necessity of selling to the garrison at the market Price, only that according to custom he is to be allowed one shilling York per gallon for drawing. I request the favour that you will favour me with His Excellency’s sentiments on this affair, and also what answer I am to give to Hamilton and Cartwright about the 500 gallons Rum they lent Major Ross at Oswego. Please inform His Excellency that I had a Letter from Lieut Col DePeyster of the 11th of August, with the following Paragraph: “1 have made enquiry concerning the ﬂour and the price it sells at, “and ﬁnd it still at £5 Currency, but hope it will soon fall to £3-10 “York currency per hundred, we have not one drop of Rum in store “here, the Naval Department begin to cry out; I have delivered up “the management of the Indian department to Mr. McKee so have “got rid of a deal of trouble.” That the Seamen might not desert for the want of their Rum, I have this day ordered a Puncheon of Rum to be sent to Commissary War- ren to be issued to the seamen at Fort Erie, when they may have it the same as they got it at Detroit. I would send some Rum to Colonel DePeyster but have none to send except His Excellency will authorize me to get some from Carleton Island, there is some Rum there, but the Commissary General has sent orders that none is to be got from thence without a particular order from the Commander in Chief, how I am to act, I have got four Puncheons of it, otherwise I could not have sent any to the sailors at Fort Erie, nor pay the Rum got by Sir John Johnson when here for the Indians, its a Pity that such a cursed Liquor ever had been found out. I declare I have more Plague with Rum than all the other Business I have to do, the sea- men must have it for its a part of their wages, and they will desert or mutiny if they do not get it.

When we came to survey the Trunks & Boxes we suspected to have been pillaged, there appeared to be eighteen pieces of Linen taken out of some of them, and roots of Trees and Lodds put in it to make weight, and 26 pieces of chintz out of one box. I have had 7 Barrels of Rum for Michilimackinac surveyed on their being landed on the wharf.

Capt. Brant saluted the Nations present in the usual manner 8; then said Brothers & Nephews! We the chief warriors of the Six Nations with this belt clear your Ears, that you may listen with attention and without interruption to what we have to say. Delivers a Belt. Brothers 8: Nephews! We now conform to the ancient custom of our Fore Fathers, to con- dole with you for the Losses you have sustained in the war, and we hope your minds will now be eased from all trouble, since we have gathered the bones of all your dear departed Friends and covered them over, so that_all is smooth and even. Delivers a Large Belt. ‘ Brothers & Nephews! ' We shall now acquaint you with our motives for taking an early and active part in the war; at ﬁrst it was hard for us to determine which side to join with, as they were the same People ﬁghting against each other, but upon mature and deliberate conideration, we thought it incumbent upon us to join the King our Father, for had we pre-. tended to be neutral, we should have been divided amongst ourselves, for our young men would have acted on some side or other, by which we might have fought against each other, and ruin ourselves. Actuated as we were by our feelings and reasonings we could not but adhere to our former engagements of Fidelity to the King of Great Britain, we therefore resolved to take that side, and urged you also to do so, altho’ the force of the Americans appeared to be more powerful than that of the King, yet it did not deter us from following the

Several Strings. Brothers & Nephews! We shall now inform you of the Transactions of Councils held at Niagara by Brigadier General Sir John Johnson, this Summer with us. He informed us that the Peace was brought about, and desired us for to remain quiet and cease Hostilities. We accordingly agreed to lay our Hatchets aside & looked with a watchful eye towards our Lands, for the boundary Line which was agreed to ﬁfteen years ago. And Sir John Johnson assured us that the boundary Line lately agreed to, did not deprive us of our Lands. The war not being of our own making, we readin agreed to what Sir John had recom- mended to us, altho’ we the Six Nations are never hasty in our resolves when matters of war are concerned, and altho’ we have laid the Hatchet aside, should they give us just cause to use it, we shall nevertheless be able to take it up in defence of our Rights. We mean to take care that we give no cause of rupture on our parts—Brothers & Nephews, we desire you to pay attention to this, and do the same thing that we have resolved to, and do nothing in a hasty manner, let everything go thro’ its proper channel that we may be of one mind and act alike. Delivers a Belt. Brothers and Nephews attend. That as it was the custom of the English as well as ours, at the conclusion of a Peace to set the Prisoners at Liberty, he hoped that we would follow the same rule, to which we immediately complied, for as we declared before, we would give no cause of offence on our parts, and if we take up the Hatchet it would be the cause of the White People and not ours: We therefore earnestly recommend to you to do the same as we have done, that the Prisoners be set at Liberty. Delivers a Belt. Brothers and Nephews. You the Hurons, Delawares, Shawanese, Mingoes, Ottawas, Chip- peweys, Poutteawatamies, Creeks & Cherokees.

We return you and the Six Nations our hearty thanks for the good speeches you have given us. Father! At the time you assembled us at Detroit and took us by the hand to accompany you to this place, we did not understand that it would be any part of your business to collect our prisoners. We are deceived in that for we understood when the Hatchet was put in our hands that whatever was taken from the Enemy should remain with us in order to strengthen our Nation, therefore I will not assist you in that part. Several Strings. Mr. McKee then said: I am rather surprised that you pretend ignorance of the business we came upon, when I had a meeting with you before I left Detroit on the arrival of the Deputies from the Six Nations. I told you they came to promote the general good, and that I thought it necessary for some chiefs to accompany me and their Elder Brethren to thi side of the Lake, in order to inform the several nations who are situated near the Americans of the particulars we have received of the Peace, that they may take care not to put themselves in the way of bringing mischief upon themselves. What has now passed this day before this Assembly, is meant for your good only, if you duly attend thereto, and as to the giving up of Prisoners, it has ever been a custom both with you and the white People, at the conclusion of a Peace to give them up. Therefore as that is now the case you can no longer con- sider yourselves deceived. Delivers several strings. T’ Sindatton then said Father and Brethren of the Six Nations listen to me. You know very well when you arrived at Detroit where our Council Fire is, I then desired to know the business you came upon, that you did not tell me, then my Father took me by the hand to assist him on his business. Now that I have heard your several speeches with that of my Father, I am pleased, as they are all good, and I am con- vinced that what you have said will give general satisfaction. I beg of you the Six Nations to adhere to all you have said, and never deviate therefrom, but continue in the same mind.

We have accordingly been among those of our people and after enquiring we ﬁnd that they are contented to return home, but wish to go the way they came from.

Father! Listen! As also our Brethren the Six Nations, you have told us there is Peace. You know the Rights of our Indians in this Country, and you also know that the Tomahawk is now laid down. Brethren the Six Nations you know where the Boundary Line1 was ﬁxed, since you were the people who ﬁxed it. we now inform you that the Virginians are already encroaching upon our Lands, and we desire you and our Father to be strong, and desire them to desist from encroaching upon us, otherwise they will destroy the good work > of Peace which we are endeavouring to promote. This is all that we have to say. - Delivers Strings. Mr. McKee then said. Children!

SIR, Having ﬁnished the business which called me to this place with the Nations upon this side of the Lakes, I have the honor to forward the Transactions with them, and to acquaint you that this meeting has been of singular service in removing the doubts and uneasiness which those nations were under on our parts, and fulﬁlling the promises made to them, as far as they could reasonably eXpect, as well as sending to prevent their drawing mischief upon themselves in continuing Hostili- ties against the Frontiers of the United States, which they have now solemnly declared they will desist from; altho’ they are under great apprehensions of their designs, upon their Country, which indeed the conduct of the Americans has given too much grounds to the justice of their suspicions; having marked the Country upon this side of the Ohio as far as the neighbourhood of Kooshavvking,1 and Tuskawaras and the report of an Indian from Fort Pitt has conﬁrmed this opinion, as he says during his stay there, which was a few days: Numbers of Boats were passing down the Ohio, which he was informed were going _to take up Lands upon the Indian side near the Shawanese, and Hunters just returned from that Quarter say that they fell in with several Parties of Virginians on their hunting grounds, who told them they were taking up Lands there before their great People engross’d it, which they expected would soon be the case. These Information has alarmed the Deputies of the Six Nations who attended at this meeting and they have invited Chiefs from those nations to accompany them Home, in order to assist in representing the unjust encroach- ments making on their country. I have just received a Speech delivered lsce ante p. 32.

Sm I am honoured with your letter of the 23rd Sept. mentioning that a quantity of Rum was to be sent up to this Post, but seeing that none was like to arrive in time to send to Michilimackinac as the season advanced fast, and hearing that Captain Robertson was greatly in debt for the article, I thought it best to borrow 17 Barrels which I sent to him which with what I had already borrowed for the use of the Naval Department makes 22 Barrels. Eleven Barrels & one Puncheon are since arrived, which the Commissary credits in the annexed Return and charges our Issues opposite so that the 22 Barrels still remain a debt from me to the merchant. I think it proper to give you this Information in hopes that you will in the distribution, please order wherewith to pay off the debt independent of the quantity necessary to carry us thro’ the winter. Three men are lately arrived from Red Stone Creek.1 They are brothers to our Interpreters the Girtys2 and a McCarthy lately killed. The sole intent of their Journey is to see what incouragement they will meet if they settle under the British Government, assuring me also that several hundreds will be glad to come off, as they see nothing but persecution preparing for such as were not hearty in the American cause. They assure me that Little’s dispositiona (deposition) is by no means exaggerated.

Boards 8; Lumber of all kinds, Flour, Corn, Fish & Horses &c will meet with good markets in this Island, 8: I beg leave to assure you, that every encouragement & attention in my Power, shall be shewn to His Majesty’s subjects of Quebec trading to Jamaica. I have the honor to be Sir Your Excellency’s most obedient His Excelly humble Servant General Haldimand Ancnn. CAMPBELL [B 175, p 229]

196 HALDIMAND PAPERS SIR JOHN JOHNSON TO GEN. FREDERICK IIALDIMAND MONTREAL 30h Oct 1783 Sm, ‘ I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of Your Excellency’s letter of the 27th Instant, and in obedience thereto, and nearly agreable to a Plan I gave in last Autumn, I beg leave to offer as my opinion that, should we occupy Posts in the neighbourhood of those we now hold, and wih to retain the Indians in our Interest, it will be neces- ' sary even in a Peace Establishment to keep up at each of the three Principal Post namely Niagara Detroit and Mackinac a Deputy Agent, a clerk who may act as store keeper, two Interpreters and one or two Blacksmiths as circumstances may require. An agent or residing ofﬁcer will also be necessary at Cataraqui should the Mohawks and part of the Six Nations retire to that side of the Lake, with an Inter- preter or two and a smith. The business of the lower part of the Canada Department may very easily be transactedby the Superinten- dent with the assistance of two Interpreters for the Indians of the Department, and one for the Six Nations who may occasionally come down. This Plan will make a very great saving, and I am conﬁdent will fully answer every necessary end. I am certainly of opinion with your Excellency relative to the Indians of Canada, their situation is full as good, If not better, than at the commencement of the war, they therefore cannot expect any other attention than was shown them at that period, such Chiefs as may have distingmished themselves may receive a little present occasionally and such families as may. be left in a distressed situation by the loss of friends in the War may receive some provision and a little cloath- ing annually. It is all the Six Nations themselves expect whose pre- tentions and claims are better founded. The great demands on me for pay and Disbursements of the several Branches of the Indian Department, oblige me to request that your Excellency will be pleased to order me a warrant for ten thousand pounds sterling not having it yet in my power to make out the general accounts not yet given in. I have the honor to be with the greatest respect Sir Your Excellency-"s most obedient and most humble Servant JOHN JOHNSON Endorsed: From A 1783. B. Genl. Sir John Johnson 3011 Oct. Reed. lst Nov.

ROBERT MATIIEW'S Fon'r Scumssan DEAR Sm 1St Nov' 1783. ~ There is a gentleman of the name of McDonell who lives now at La Chime (La Chine) that has lost everything he had through his Loyalty to his Majesty and tho’ he was burthened with a numerous Family the- only thing he ever got from Government was a few Rations for them, and that has lately been withdrawn from them by Mr. Culyer (Cuyler) on a supposition I imagine that Mr. McDonnell was in such circumstances as to be able to support his Family without any such aid which is not the case. Since he came into Canada by much industry in trade he became possessed of about ﬁfteen hundred pounds Sterling every Shilling of which he lost this summer by the failure of a merchant at Detroite, and he is at present an object worthy your humane attention, & if it lies in your power to get his Rations restored to him you will render him essential service, by doing it, and you would exceedingly oblige me thereby. This gentleman is Cousin Germain to Captain McDonnell of C. But- ler’s Rangers his bashfulness would not permit him to trouble His Excellency with solicitations for such favors as he sees others get, which leads me to mention his situation to you and to entreat your good ofﬁces in his behalf. I ought to have begun my Letter by explaining to you my reason for interceeding for him—it is this, and I hope it will plead my excuse my dear Sir, for the liberty I take——

I had sent off some goods for Niagara, and have sent off a larger supply since for Niagara and Detroit. Lieut Colonel Butler acquaints me in a Letter of the 2nd Instant that the Faith had been cast away at Long Point upon Lake Erie, unfortunately there were ﬁve Batteaux Loads of goods on board of her this will leave Detroit bare of goods this winter, unless they save that part, among other things that they expect to recover, or the season should prove favourable, and the goods that are going up should arrive this year. I transmit herewith an Extract of a Letter from Mr. McKee upon a subject that may occasion some disputes and uneasinesses among the Indians If not timely prevented. In consequence of your Excellency’s desire signiﬁed to me by Lieut Col. Campbell I wrote to Major Harris to endeavour to prevent as much as possible Doctor Gill’s1 Scheme of Inoculation from taking place or spreading, and I hope my letter would arrive in time to put a stop to it.

FREDERICK HALDIMAND TO SIR JOHN JOHNSON HEAD Qcaarsus QUEBEC SIR, 15h Nov. 1783. I have been favoured by your Letter of the 10h Instant covering an Extract of a Letter from Mr. McKee. the substance of which is of a very extraordinary nature; I encloe for your information a copy of a Letter upon the same subject and I have made Inquiry of Governor Hamilton if the application therein mentioned had been made to him. He had not received anything 'of the kind so that there is a possibility that Mr. Schieﬂiin may not have procured the grant which may also be supposed from his having denied the Fact to Captain Bird; but if he really has and has had the Presumption to have it registered (which can be very easily ascertained) I must desire that you will direct Mr. McKee to strike him immediately oﬂf the List as such 8: to assemble such Council as may be necessary upon the occasion 8: Express to the Indians your disapprobation of Mr. Schiefllin’s conduct, in such terms as you think ﬁt. He is the more culpable, having in the course of his duty been witness to Lt. Governor Hamilton’s dis- pleasure on a similar occasion and his positive commands against any practice of the kind. The loss of the Indian Presents is very unfortunate it will be neces- sary that you write fully upon that Subject; to Mr. McKee to con- vince the Indians that nothing was neglected to furnish them with the supply promised to them, and that seeing their present disappointment has proceeded from an unavoidable accident, they must be patient under it until! the season will admit of another being sent out to them, for he must not in consequence of this accident purchase goods from the merchants. You will please also to desire that the practice of purchasing fresh

Major Ross has strongly recommended an old Indian Mynass as having been very useful in facilitating the purchase of the Land from the Mississagues.1 I wish that service to be marked by some Gratuity, such as you think will be best received by him. I am &c [signed] F. H. Endorsed: To B. Genl. Sir John Johnson of the 13h Nov. 1783. [B 115, p 184] ‘ SIR JOHN JOHNSON TO GEN. FREDERICK HALDIMAND MONTREAL 17h Nov. 1783 Sm, I shall in consequence of Your Excellency’s Letter of the 10h Instant, take the earliest opportunity to write to Mr. McKee upon the subject of Mr. Scheﬂ’elin’s Grant. I had wrote to him relative to the goods that were on board of the Faith and acquainted him that another large supply was on the way, but was apprehensive it would not arrive this Fall—I also forbid him to purchase any more fresh meat for the use of the Indian Department not only on account of the shameful price that has hitherto been charged for it, but as an article totally unnecessary, particularly at this time. The Indian Chief Mynass has not only been useful in facilitating the purchase of the lands from the Mississagas, but he has sold his own lands from the River Toniato to Cataraqui, including all the country between the River St. Lawrence and the Grand River, for which he and his family are promised to be cloathed during his life, he has already received it for this winter, with some cash. As it is probable we shall soon be reduced. I must once more in justice to the ofﬁcers of my Regiment remind Your Excellency of the vacancies in both Battalions, and as they have been very instrumental in the raising of it, and have served their King & Country faithfully, and with honor to themselves for upwards of seven years, and have suffered several losses for their attachment to Government, I cannot but ﬂatter myself that Your Excellency will, with me, think them the ‘See appendix.

I humbly beg leave to inform your Excellency that I have two daughters in Law (named Mary & Anne Westz) at Colonel De Peyster’s who have lived with him upwards of four years. They were taken prisoners by a War Party of Delaware Indians in the year 1779 who took them to Detroit when COlonel De Peyster made intercession for their delivery, which he happily eﬁ'ected. I have wrote him several Letters, requesting he wou’d send them to Niagara, to which he replied “That the Girls could not be spared.” I then beg’d Col. Johnson to write to him on the occasion, which he accord- ingly did, but proved unsuccessful. Last year I applied to Sir John Johnson, who wrote to him when last at Niagara on the subject of his sending them to this Province. The other day he was pleased to inform me, that he had received no answer respecting the Prisoner Girls. I now humbly beg that Your Excellency will be pleased to Interfere in my behalf, for I am lately informed that He will not part with them till he has received positive orders from Your Excelly. for that purpose; which I humbly beg to be honored with your Excellency’s commands on that head.

From the Tenor of such behavior he was “become so disagreeable to them that it became almost incumbent “upon me to dismiss him from the ofﬁce he held in the Department, “particularly as it was at the same time conforming to your instruc- “tions, as well as doing justice to them. Seven Indians had granted “to him Forty nine miles a circumstance alone suﬂicient to evince “their Ignorance of what they did; however a protest signed in Coun— “cil by the Principal (“hiefs of the Hurons.

I think the Periods you mentioned for the Reduction here, & in the Upper Country are very proper, and they shall take place accordingly, in the mean time the Persons to be employed must be determined upon—Altho’ nothing in Mr. Schietfelin’s power to say can justify his conduct I wait for the Defence & Narrative you men- tion before I enter upon the subject of it.

DEAR Sm I received your favour inclosing His Excellency the Generals Pass for Mr. Ellice. Since I had the pleasure of seeing you I have had the pleasure of receiving letters addressed to our house from Messrs Macomb of Detroit requesting that as goods could not be returned for those they lef Col De Peyster have, owing to the vessels not being able to get there, we would apply to Sir Johnson for Payment of the balance due on the draft on him. Application has been made to him at Montreal 8: he recommended my applying to you as he says he has no authority to act in the Business without orders from the Commander in Chief. Capt. McDonell has also wrote to us that he has transmitted the pay List for the Rangers Subsistence 8: requests we would apply for a warrant, he seems very anxious to know when the corps are to be reduced in which we cannot satisfy him. I take the Libirty of enclosing our account against Govt. for Interest due on the General’s acceptances last summer which he then promised Mr. Lister (Lester)3 to pay. As I propose leaving this place on Friday morning, I should be happy to have your answer 8: I am convinced your goodness will excuse the trouble I have taken.

Extracts of the Instructions and Letters upon that subject. are herein transmitted. These orders were not received until] it was too late, in the season to communicate them to the Upper Country, so as to have effect, and tho I am naturally anxious that they should be executed as soon, as possible, yet I have not received any Instructions concerning the Evacuation of the Posts in the Upper Country, nor even the diﬁnitive Treaty & that I am in Dayly expectation of them. I do not think ﬁt to risk, the conse- quences, which disbanding and reducing the Troops, might have with the Indians, untill I shall receive my Dispatches, at the same time I have to desire that you will be in readiness on the shortest notice to reduce the Kings (or 8th) & 34h Regiments to the present Establish- ment, and to disband the corps of Rangers, commanded by Lieut Col.

Sm, When you was at Montreal your time was so much employed in matters of Public concern, that I had not the opportunity I wished for to enquire your Sentiments on the Ambiguous Sence of the late Treaty of Peace, respecting the Line of Boundary between this Province and the United States, from Lake Superior to the Westward; with regard to which I must remark, there is no such Thing as a Long Lake as lSee appendlx.
Page 220
220 HALDIMAND PAPERS expressed in the Treaty,1 the only communication from Lake Superior, is by that Tract of Land known by the name of the Grand Portage; which leads to a very small River on the West side, that derives its source from an adjacent Lake, and from thence to the extent of Lake Le pluie about one Hundred Leagues it is not as described a Long Lake, (Rainy Lake) but is rather a Chain of Lakes, few of which have any visible Inlet or Communication with each other, which occasions in that short distance upwards of Forty carrying places; so that we are at less to know from the Tenor of the Treaty where the Line is intended to be drawn, and anxiously wish to be informed about it, that we may not without previous notice, and sufﬁcient time given to withdraw our prop- erty be deprived of the only communication from this Province to the North West, indeed for my part, I apprehend a Survey of the carrying Place, and the country adjacent will be highly necessary to ascertain and ﬁx unalterably, the Line in that Quarter, while on the other Time it will give us time to discover another Passage if such a Thing Exists, whereby we may in all Events leave that Branch of the Fur trade to this Province. The Gentlemen who are engaged in it ever since the year 1776, carried it on under all the disadvantages inseparable from a State of “’ar, occasioned by the high advance on goods, & heavy Insurance, notwithstanding which the Natives have been every year amply sup- plied—Posts that the French were unacquainted with have been dis- covered, and neither Industry nor Expence have been spared to extend it, & prepare for the return of Peace, in hopes that it would enable them in some degree to recover the incredible losses they have sustained, but so far from that they have everything to fear from the Line of Boundary to be ﬁxed in that Quarter. unwilling however to relinquish a Business in which they have so long persevered, and ani- mated with that Spirit natural to men who can Boast of having brought it, to its present value & Extent, I have the pleasure to acquaint you that the Proprietors have formed themselves into a Company2 for the Term of ﬁve years, of which my brother, Mr. Joseph (Frobisher) and myself, from the great Interest we hold in it & our long Experience. are named the Directors. The supplies for the present year are accordingly prepared, and ready to be sent oﬂ’ early the next month, a State of which so far as is required we have delivered to Mr. Davison the Deputy Secretary here, directing him to apply for the Pass the Company requires, which is for Twenty eight Canoes, valued at £20,000 Currency, and hope there can be no objection on the part of His Excellency the Governor to grant it. 1For Treaty and description of Boundary see Vol. XXIV, pp. 8~11, this series. 2See appendix.
Page 221
BENJAMIN FROBISHER TO ADAM MABANE 221 This large supply, added to the property the Company have already in that country demands their utmost attention. They do not know how soon they may be deprived of the immediate and at present the only communication from Lake Superior, and on that account they intend at their own Expence, unless government prefer to undertake it, to discover if possible another passage, that will in all events fall within the British Line, of which they may avail themselves in case of need. Such an undertaking, must prove an arduous one, and be attended with great Expence, while their success will remain very uncertain, on which account the company are induced to hope, that if it is discovered it will be granted to them in full right for a certain term of years, not less than seven, as a reward for their Public Spirit, and the advantages that will result to this province from the discovery; in the mean time should the Upper Posts be given up, we are con- vinced His Excellency will give such orders as may appear to him necessary for the company’s Protection, and effectually prevent any Persons from the United States penetrating into Lake Superior, untill the Line of Boundary in that Quarter is surveyed & unalterably ﬁxed, that their Property may not be exposed, nor the present Communica- tion in the least degree interrupted untill they are legally entitled to take possession, and if by that Time no other Passage is discovered, they even hope in that case, it may be stipulated for the carrying place, and the communication to the Extent of their Territory on Lake Du Bois to remain equally free for both parties, which from the great superiority we have over them in that Business will almost effectually secure it to this Province: and this demand may he insisted on with great propriety from the Carrying Places to that Extent laying equally on both sides the Line, so that it would be impossible to penetrate into the Country without encroaching upon each other, besides there is no Furr Trade within their Limits in that Quarter, but what the Company or any other from this Country would gladly relinquish, and of course their views if they are well informed of the Country cannot be to beneﬁt themselves but to distress others who have better prospects. If ever this Country see the fatal moment of giving up the Upper Posts. probably others may be established in different places on the opposite side of the Line in which case if government thinks Lake Superior and the Countries with which it communicates worthy of notice, permit me to give you my opinion, which may be of some use. untill a Survey is made, especially at this Time when the Settle- ment of the Loyalists and others are under consideration. That is to have a Post so as to command the entrance into Lake Superior, either
Page 222
222 HALDIMAND PAPERS below the Falls of St. Marys or above them, with regard to the former I cannot point out any particular spot suitable for the purpose, but with respect to the latter I can speak with some certainty—I mean the place called Point aux Pins where Mr. Baxter1 (Alexander) who was sent out from England some years ago in search of Copper Mines ﬁxed his residence. It is situate on the East side about two Leagues above the Falls on a narrow channel that commands in the most eﬁ'ectual manner the entrance into Lake Superior, it has the advantage of a ﬁne Bason formed by the Point where Vessels lay in deep water within a few yards of the shore equally secure in Winter as in Summer. The Land about the Point is Sandy, but backwards I have been informed it is very good, and capable of raising grain of different kinds, nor is there any risque of being disturbed by the natives, they are too few in number & would be more inclined to court the Friendship of those that may be settled there than to distress them—All the Indian Corn such a Settlement could raise for many years, would be taken from them at a high price by those who frequent Lake Superior, in pref- erence to that of getting it from Detroit, and on the other hand a very slender stock of Provisions added to the Fishing they would be pos- sessed of at the Falls for seven months in the year would enable them to live comfortably until] their Lands were stocked, and in a state of cultivation. Such a settlement would prove of Public utility, and in the course of a few years give an oppty to continue those researches on the North side that were begun by the French, and recently by Mr. Baxter, the former were obliged to relinquish their prospects from the only vessel they had on that Lake being Lost about the Time this country was conquered, and the Latter chieﬂy from the high price of labour 8:. Provisions. I beg leave to recommend the contents of this Letter to your most serious consideration, requesting you will communicate it to His Excellency when oppty otters, or if more agreeable I will write to Major Matthews on such matters as you may point out, to be laid before Him, in the mean time I request you will favour me with your Sentiments and remain with great respect & esteem dear Sir your most obedt & very hble.

I have received your Letter of the 19h Instant desiring Instruction relative to your departure for Detroit. the ignorance in which I still remain respecting the measures to be adopted in the Upper Country in consequence of the Deﬁnitive Treaty of Peace. leaves me nothing to add to the Instructions I gave you last Fall and tho’ it is probable that I shall soon receive orders which might perhaps render your Journey unnecessary in the event of the Posts being evacuated yet I am unwilling in that uncertainty to prevent you from availing your- self of the most favorable season for the journey you have to take, you will therefore proceed to Detroit as soon as your convenience will permit—In answer to the other subjects of your Letter I have to acquaint you that the claims of Individuals upon Indian Lands at Detroit or any other part of the Province are invalid and the mode of acquiring Lands by what is called Deed of gift is to be entirely dis- countenanced for by the King‘s instructions no private Person society corporation or colony is capable of acquiring any property in Lands belonging to the Indians either by purchases of, or grant of convey- ance, from the said Indians excepting only where the Lands lye within the Limits of any colony the soil of which has been vested in Proprietaries or Corporations, by grants from the Crown, in which cases such proprietaries or corporations only shall be capable of acquiring such property by purchase or grants from the Indians. It is also necessary to observe to you that by the King’s Instructions no Purchases of Land belonging to the Indians whether in the name or for the use of Proprietaries of Colonies be made but at some general meeting at which the Principal Chiefs of each Tribe claiming a proper in such Lands are present, and all Tracts so purchased must be regularly surveyed by a sworn surveyor or in the presence, and with the assistance of a person deputed by the Indians to attend such sur- vey, and the said surveyor shall make an accurate map of such Tract describing the limit, which map shall be entered upon the record, with the deed of conveyance from the Indians. These Instructions lay totally aside the claim of a Mr. Sheﬂ‘lin (Schieﬁ‘elin) which you will hear of at Detroit, to an Indian Grant of Land even had he obtained it by less unworthy means than He did, some application to or oﬁer from the Indians at Detroit for Lands, has been made in favor of, the ofﬁcers & Interpreters who have served during the war, with them, should it

In regard to per- sons from Virginia & Maryland, who may propose themselves as settlers, in the neighbourhood of Detroit, great attention must be paid not to receive any whose political character will not bear the nicest scrutiny, His Majesty’s Instructions for granting Lands on the present occasion positively directing that none shall be permitted to settle in this province but those of approved Loyalty for which purpose it is directed that all persons who settle therein shall besides the usual oaths of allegiance &ca make and subscribe the following declaration “I, A. B. do promise and declare that I will maintain and defend to the utmost of my power the authority of the King, and his parliament as the Supreme Legislature of the Province” Persons of the above description I shall have no objection to receive, and should any oﬂ'er you will report to me their characters, and requests before you enter into any engagements with them.

Altho’ I have not yet received any Instructions or Information respecting the fate of our Posts, in the Upper Country it would appear from American publication that they are to be evacuated agreeably to the diﬁnitive Treaty, when that happens, it is probable that posts will be established upon the opposite side for the security of the Fur Trade, and as there is no situation where one will be more necessary than at the Entrance of Lake Superior I wish to have early Information and to take measures for that purpose so as to have a small Garrison & Settlement established there on the shortest notice Point aua: Pins, about two leagues above the Falls of St. .Marys, appears by the map, and from Information I have received to be the ﬁttest place, to sit down upon, it was formerly occupied by a Mr. Baxter, a Partner, and Agent of a company, engaged in copper mines, and is capable of advantageous cultivation, the soil being good a little way back I must therefore desire that as soon after you will set off, for that 'place, taking with you a sufﬁcient number of artiﬁcers and men whom you will leave there to make preparations for stockading 82 necessary buildings to accommodate a garrison consisting of thirty or Forty men. You will be particular in your remarks, upon the situ- ation with regard to defence and the advantages necessary for the pro- tection of the Trade comprehending the water communication, if vessels can lye there in safety and be conveniently put up there in winter. and if there is Timber at hand suitable for Ship Building as nothing will be more serviceable to the Traders than the Establish- ment of Farmers to supply them with Corn & in time with other pro- visions, it may be a favorable situation for the settlement of a few Loyalists, you would therefore do well to take with you some person skilled in Land in order to obtain some knowledge of what is practi- cable in that way and it would not be amiss if you can ﬁnd anyone who will undertake it to carry some corn of different kinds some Potatoes & a few small seeds to make a trial this very year, should I receive any Instructions that may make this measure unnecessary, I shall communicate them to you, without loss of time so that you may desist upon the shortest notice. I shall wait with Impatience for your Report and I mention Point auw Pins as the place that appears to me to be the most proper, but by no means to conﬁne your attention to that only, as I wish to have your opinion of any other that may

Stores to be delivered at West Point, New York. or some other convenient place. With regard to the ﬁrst point as the season of the year is already advanced and as much time will be required in furnishing necessary supplies for the Garrison during the Winter, it is an object of very great importance and I must beg leave to be solicitous with your Excellency to ﬁx a very early period. As the Posts of the above description are numerous and its being probable that it may not be convenient to withdraw the Troops from the whole, exactly at the same time, I wish your Excellency to be particular in ﬁxing the precise period, when each will be delivered up. If your Excellency approves the proposal of exchanging the Cannon Stores &c it will be necessary to ﬁx on some criterion of their goodness. I would therefore propose that the particular negociatiou be referred to two Artillery ofﬁcers, one from each side, who shall personally inspect the Cannon 8: Stores 8; in case of not agreeing shall call in a Third Person.

Vice Admiral of the same 8: (‘ommandcr in Chief of His Majesty's Forces. The Memorial of the Merchants of Montreal trading to the Upper Posts and country depending by way of the Lake. Sheweth That your memorialists in consequence of your Excellency’s Licences for that purpose, have this year continued to send up merchandize in order to carry on the Indian Trade to a great value and depending on His Majesty’s Vessel to transport the goods across the Lakes they did not think it requisite to take any other precaution to insure to their correspondents at the Posts the speedy Transportation of their goods. That your memorialists being informed of the reduction of the Naval Department to two Vessels on Lake Ontario and the same number on Lake Erie are greatly apprehensive least the merchandize they have already sent forward to Carleton Island as well as further quantities which they have orders to provide and send up should from that reduction be altogether prevented from getting this year to market a circumstance that would tend to the ruin of your memorialists & to the loss of great part of that valuable Trade to the Province. That since the conclusion of the war several small vessels have been built, on Lake Erie by the Merchants of Detroit, presuming that in time of Peace there would not be any impediment to the free naviga- tion of their own vessels. But your memorialists understand that they are prevented from that freedom to their great hurt 8: prejudice. Your Memorialists beg leave to state that the quantity of goods now laying at Carleton Island does not fall short in value of £40,000 and in bulk of seventy Battoe Loads which would require three trips of the largest vessels on Lake Ontario to transport them to Niagara 8: there are near to Four thousand Packs of Peltries expected this season from Detroit of which a small part only is as yet brought down. Your memorialists having represented to your Excellency the hard- ships to which they are reduced by the unforseen reduction of the Naval Department upon the Lakes have the ﬁrmest reliance that your Excellency will be pleased to give such orders touching the premises as to your “'isdom may seem ﬁt. Humbly suggesting that it may be necessary to continue a third vessel upon each of the Lakes Ontario and Eric to transport the merchants effects for this season and that Liberty may be given for small vessels of private property on Erie to navigate without hindrance.

His Excellency having reason to think that the Posts in the Upper Country will not be given up so soon as was expected, until the Americans manifest a stronger Inclination (than they have hitherto done) to fulﬁll on their Part, the Articles of the Deﬁnitive Treaty, and not having received any Instructions from Home authorizing Him to establish new Posts in consequence of the Expected Evacuation of the old. He does not think proper to do any thing (until he shall be so instructed) at Thessalon, and therefore desires that you will desist making any further preparations there, leaving if you think it neces- sary three or four men to take charge of Timber, or other materials that may have been collected, if these are of any consequence (such as Tools or Iron Work) they must be removed to Michilimackinac. The Information you have obtained, and what is already done cannot fail of facilitating the establishment of a Post should it be found expedi- ent, upon the Evacuation of Michilimackinac.

Altho’ it is not in my power to gratify the wishes of the Persons concerned in this undertaking, and of the Indians by conﬁrming their gift immediately without conforming to His Majesty’s Instructions, communicated to you in my Letter of the 26h April last, I consider the intended Settlement as a matter that may prove of inﬁnite utility to the Strength and Interest of this Province, and wish to give it every encouragement in my power, I therefore wait with impatience for your report upon this matter. In the mean time, in order to make speedy provision for the maintenance of these His Majesty’s Loyal Subjects now dismissed from His service, I have agreed they shall carry on their Improvements with every diligence in their Power, until the Land can be laid out 8: granted agreeably to the King‘s Instructions, and the mode in practice in the lower parts of the Province.

252 HALDIMAND PAPERS will please to signify upon your Receipt of this Letter your full per- mission to persons of every description to leave the Post of Detroit as soon as they shall think ﬁt, with orders to such as do not purpose to reside there to depart immediately. In the Provision Returns I am surprised to see Prisoners of War incerted. if there are any such remaining send them home without loss of time. unless they have stayed at Detroit from choice, in that case they ought not to be stiled Prisoners of war, nor receive Provisions. My Letter of the—— ' respecting the description of persons to be received as settlers at Detroit is, I think, very explicit, and in regard to those who come in occasionally, upon private affairs. if their conduct is open 8: proper, they may be permitted to do their Business & return, but if in any respect the cont 'ary, you will dismiss them immediately. I come now to answer that very extraordinary'part of your Letter wherein you have thought proper to say that my standing orders for the Posts in regard to Indian affairs, have not been nor can they be strictly complied with, without disgusting the Indians. “'hen those orders 8: regulations were formed I was well aware that they would not be relished by the Commanding ofﬁcers of the Posts but as they were not calculated to gratify vanity, or any other propensity, but entirely to prevent abuses which had so glaringly displaied themselves. and also instead of disgusting to please the Indians by submitting their affairs to the management of their affairs to the persons belonging to their own Department under the direction of a Superintendent General appointed by His Majesty for that purpose I required that they should be strictly observed and shall not deviate therefrom. The Regulations were not hastily put together but were founded upon conviction and the best information I could obtain from Persons whose knowledge and experience in Indian Affairs are indisputable. If displeasing the Indians in such manner as may bring on bad consequences is to be the result of your obeying my orders and that that effect is to proceed from your long Residence at Detroit your personal knowledge of the Principal Indians and Tribes, and the conﬁdence they always hare and do now shew they have inv you, these circumstances which would appear advantageous are much to be regret- ted I cannot therefore help observing to you that. as you are the ﬁrst Person who have stated difﬁculties in the execution of these orders & that their good effects to the King‘s service have been already very materially felt. it becomes an object worthy your particular care that the change you have anticipated shall not take place. ‘ I shall have no difficulty in granting deeds to Mr McKee and

His Excellency considering the situation of the Present party on the Island. the great improbability of any hostile attack being made upon it—the cessation of all work, and the assistance you very probably derive from the Inhabitants in defence of their own Property, He has not the least Apprehension on account of the weakness of your garrison. The general approves much of your having sent a careful man with three Canadians to Tessalon—The idea which he has conceived of that place and the favorable Reports Mr. Grant has made of it to you, encourages His Excellency to hope that it will become a place of inﬁnite consequence to the Furr Trade of this Province. but to effect that and many other things it will be indispensany necessary to he ﬁrst acquainted with the Intention of Government respecting the I'pper Country in general.

Depeyster, ' SIR I have to acknowledge the Receipt of your Letters of 15h 20th 8: 21st July last. As the Grist & Saw Mills built by Mr. Brass are compleated and are estimated by good Judges to be well worth the sum He charges for them (£465 N. Y. Currency) which is within the original estimate he gave in for that work, you will please to draw upon me for Amount as soon as you shall think ﬁt. Your Instructions to Major Ancrum to support the Plickets at Fort Erie in the best manner possible for this year, were very proper, as no expence must be incurred at any of the Posts until His Majesty’s Intentions respecting the Upper Country shall be u1timately known. Upon receipt of your Letter I gave Orders to send you, Six new Batteaux for the Transport of Provisions to Fort Erie and I hope some of them are by this time arrived, more shall be forwarded in the Spring if found necessary. As Colonel Butler is come down to Montreal and will I suppose come thus far, I shall settle with him for the Payment of the Detach- ment of His Rangers under Captain Caldwell for the time they were detained upon service subsequent to the 24h of June. I have received the deed for a Grant of Land which was unwarrantably obtained by Mr. Schieﬁ'elin from some Indians and shall of course reverse it. I have honored your Drafts for £556-1—1— and £140—3—4 N. Y. Cur- rency for the reason mentioned in your Letter to Major Mathews and must desire that you will rigidly adhere to your Intentions therein expressed of totally avoiding any Expence whatever on Account of Public Works. I have in your Letter of the 21st July received a List of the sub- scribers for Lands at Niagara and hope the Survey has been long since compleated and that the Settlers are in possession of their Lots. The following are Extracts of Letters from Lieut. Governor Hay, which require explanation from you, and which I wish to have by the ﬁrst opportunity. “As all Public Works are ordered to cease here it is my duty to “inform Your Excellency that the Front and Rear of this Town is “open, the Pickets having been taken down by order of Colonel De “Peyster and the continuation of the Lots to the River given to the

The memorial of Captain Alexl' Grant Sheweth, That your memorialist having been in the very early part of his Life bread to the sea was in the year 1759 appointed, by commission from Lord Amherst, to the commander of a Sloop of 16 guns on Lake Champlain, where the 77 Regiment in which he was then a Lieutenant happened to be—That in the following year he was appointed by His Lordship to the command of a Brig of 20 Guns. and the other vessels upon that Lake. That when Captain Loring quitting the service upon the peace of 1763 your memorialist was continued by General Gage, then Com- mander in Chief, with the Direction of all the vessels upon the several Lakes, until the commencement of the late Rebellion when in 1777 he was commissioned by His Excellency Sir Guy Carleton to command all His Majesty’s Vessels upon the Lakes Ontario, Erie, Huron 8: Michigan.

That the Reduction of the Marine Department 8: of the Pay of the ofﬁcers who do remain (upon an uncertain footing) which Your Excel- lency has necessarily made in consequence of the Peace, together with the loss of His Half Pay as Lieut in the Army since 1776 renders his Income so very inconsiderable as to deprive him of the Hope of main- taining His Family and cannot, He ﬂatters himself he considered by Your Excellency as a Reward for 30 years faithful service 25 of which have been spent on the Lakes in a constant attention'to His Duty, which he is so happy as to have discharged to the satisfaction of His superiors.

I am commanded by his Excellency to acquaint you that he has not, nor will not give any such authority to the commanding ofﬁcers on the contrary, a strict compliance with his late general Instructions for the management of the Indian Department, drawing a Line for the conduct of the Commanding Ofﬁcers of Posts (a copy of which is lodged at every Post) has been required of them. It is true that at Michilimackinac that Business is from neces- sity still conducted by the Commanding Oﬂicer who was chosen for that Post from His Experience in Indian affairs, and a perfect con- ﬁdence in his Integrity and readiness to concurr in, and carry into execution whatever should be proposed for the Interest of.‘ the Crown, and recommended by you. If you think any Reform can be made there, or at any other of the Posts, in which it shall be necessary for the General to interpose, He desires you will mention your wishes to him that no Time may be lost in doing it. In regard to the latter part of your letter, the General desires I would acquaint you that there is not a vacant Birth in the Brig Elizabeth and that many persons who had applied for Passages are still unprovided.

I did however some time in Winter order Mr. McKee to include the pay of the Interpreters and others as well as the Indian Expenses at that Post in his accounts, forbidding at the same time the purchase of Corn or any other article not absolutely necessary—how far he will be able to put my orders in execution, 'I know not, but he immediately forwarded them with the orders for the Reduction, which he did not receive till the month of June, owing to the vessels not sailing as early as usual.

Govr Hay given himself the trouble to have enquired of the ﬁrst person he met, before he made his report to your Excellency He would have been informed, that the greatest part of the Pickets ill supported (as I am informed under his own inspection) were blown down & ﬂoated off by a sudden rise of the River, which carried them into Lake Erie, which circumstance I. reported to the Commander in Chief before Lieut Du Vernet, the then Engineer left Detroit—The few remaining Pickets were imployed to compleat the continuation of the line up to the glacis and some few were employed to enclose the waste ground which left an ugly lurking place near the old Powder MagazineL-With respect to the continuation of the Lots inclosed by the Proprietors, It is a matter of fact, which I neither can nor wish to deny, they consisted of a small space of rugged Hill which was a public nuisance, being a receptacle for all manner of ﬁlth, and a Retreat for Drunken Indians that frequently made ﬁres, and were very troublesome when dislodged—I therefore requested of the Proprietors to enclose the ground back of their several Lots which some of them did more to oblige me than from any real advantage to themselves, leaving a Road of Communica- tion from the part of the Town to the King’s Wharf which was much wanting, and which I had not leisure to make. And here give me leave Sir, to declare upon the word & honor of an ofﬁcer and a gentle- man, that I never directly or indirectly did receive or intended to receive any fee or reward for the same more than the pleasure of see- ing a vile nuisance removed, 'which would otherwise have become detrimental to the health of the Troops and Inhabitants in general-— And I have to request that after all the pains and expence the Pro- prietors have been at, that it is not in my power to have it conﬁrmed to them. I also affirm that when the Line of Pickets stood upon the waters edge Indians used frequently to fasten their Canoes to them and have sometimes passed through vacancies, as seldom a night passed without some Pickets falling down, which gave such frequent occupation, taking the people from other more essential work, that I believe I should have taken the whole down had not the wind and water proved necessary to the undertaking—The last accusation is the inconveniency of the present wood yard—I acknowledge that some few cords used to be piled at the foot of the Hill, but then it was in a quagmire and otherwise liable to the same fate as the Pickets; I therefore allotted a spacious dry place adjoining the east gate, and immediately in view of the Sentry, and protected by him more than ever it was on its former position.

In case of that or any other place being taken possession of for a new settlement during my Command, I would beg leave to recommend to send an Engineer, at least, to plan out the works who I will heartily assist as I do not think myself equal to the beginning of a work of that consequence, so as to command respect from all our neighbours in future, and once well compleated, little or no expence.

Sm The 4th Instant in the Evening I had the Honor of receiving your Excellency’s Letters of the 31st of August and 3d of September by Lieut. Smyth of the 3lst Regiment, In consequence of which I informed Mr. Williams of your Excellency’s permission to resign his Employ- ments, and directed an Inventory to be made of the Records, which were delivered to Lieut. Smyth and his receipt taken for the same. _ The people express some concern at their being sent from the place, and say many must suffer in their private affairs for want of reference to them for so long a time as must necessarily pass before they .can be returned—I am informed there are many old settled Farms in this Settlement and some Grants from Indians, which will not be found in the Register not having been recorded. Before the receipt of Your Excellency’s Letter of the 31st of August I had withdrawn the permissions 'I had given for the sailing of the small .vessels of Individuals on Lake Erie they having already carried as much Peltry from this as could be got down in time this autumn; for which they had been allowed to navigate. I In obedience to Your 'Excellency’s orders I the 6h Instant published my full Permission to all Persons who chose to leave this Place, to do it when they thought ﬁt; with orders to those who do not propose to reside here to depart immediately; and the 7h in the morning I was informed by the ofﬁcer of the Guard it had been torn down, others were immediately put up, and I have offered a reward of Twenty Pounds to any one who will discover the person who did it. I cannot conceive why any body should do a thing of the sort except some insolent fellow who Chose to show how little he or others think of my authority here; but if the Person is found 8: I have

The Prisoners who have drawn Provisions since my arrival were doubtless improperly named Prisoners of War, but I found the returns expressed in that way on my arrival, and hitherto had not changed them; those who yet remain here have always been at liberty to leave the place, some stay in hopes of getting their Children & Relations who still are detained by the Indians, & some of them can not go, such as orphans 8: women who still Receive Provisions; those who got away, or, are delivered up by the Indians also receive Pro- visions suﬂicient to carry them home—I have directed Mr. Laughton (Laughton) to go down agreeable to Your Excellency’s orders. I am very sensible the Liberty I took in putting my poor opinion in Computa- tion with that of my Superiors regarding Indian Adairs was very great, and what many are not open enough to do, tho’ perhaps freely deliver their Sentiments in Conversation, but I hope Your Excellency will think it was with a good Intent and not from a turbulent disposition, always supposing myself invested by my commission with the power of a Superintendant of this place, to which appointment say the Superin- tendant General & Inspector General remembers I have expressed his satisfaction when in England. The glaring abuses which Your Excellency mentions to have dis- played themselves in the upper Posts were before I was permitted to enter in my office. - If by the Propensities Your Excellency mentions those regulations were not intended to gratify gain is meant for one. I beg leave to assure Your Excellency I was not neither am I making a fortune at the Expence of my Country, on the contrary it is notorious the heavy expences I was put to during my detention in Canada, and those I am necessarily obliged to be at in my present situation. are such as I am less able to bear than the lowest ofﬁcer in that Department. I shall certainly take care that no act of mine while I have the Honor to command here shall be reprehensible (at least intentionally so) and shall never let His Majesty’s Service suffer to gratify vanity or a desire of power, if I should be even more lowered in the eyes of the natives than I now conceive myself to be; at the same time. can not look upon myself answerable or responsible for the consequences of the proceedings of those who act independantly of me, or of affairs which I am prohibited from medling with.

268 HALDIMAND PAPERS GEN. FREDERICK HALDIMAND RELATIVE TO CAPT. ROBERTSON'S ACCOUNT QUEBEC 14h Nov' (No 13) ' 1784. SIR I herewith enclose a Letter from Capt. Robertson, commanding the Post at Michilimackinac accompanied by an account amounting to £1124..6..2% New York Currency entitled General Account of Engineer Department from the 1st of April] to the 30h of June 1784 with three particular accounts by way of Vouchers; that for £775-11-10 entitled Mr McBeath Grant & Co. Engineer Department contains a charge the last of £553—12—2 without specifying on what account it was incurred. This circumstance together with the charges in the Engineer Depart- ment so long after I had ordered all public works to be discontinued, induced me to delay payment of the Bill untill an Explanation could be had on it. I also enclose a subsequent Letter from the same oﬂicer adviseing me of his having drawn Bills upon me for the amount of £3810..8 New York Currency on account of the Indian Department and £848— 9—5 on account of contingencies the former should have been drawn upon the Department of Indian Aﬂ’airs. Captain Robertson having charge of the Indians at that Post, no agent being there at present, It is however inadmissible in. all quarters because £2591—2 of this amount is entirely for rum & in direct contradiction to my orders intimately known by Capt. Robertson prohibiting the purchase of that article. The contingent account contains a general charge of £606—12—2 sim- ilar to that of £553—12-2 in the former account, unsupported by any voucher in explanation whatever, I have consequently been obliged to refuse payment of it for the present in like manner and have written to Captain Robertson desiring he would send down vouchers for these accounts; viz for that of £1124—6—2 for the Engineer Department and for £848—9—5 the contingent account, a copy of my Letter is enclosed for your Information should these accounts be transmitted to you properly vouched, you have my authority for paying their amount by Warrant annexing the accounts thereto as I wish to discontinue entirely the mode of payment by Bills. The Indian Account will be transacted in the Department of the Superintendaut general deducting the charge for Rum which you have my authority to replace from the Commissary General’s Store in kind. I also enclose to you Letters from Captain Robertson in answer to

Sm, . . “L; Ditferent attempts having been made by the American States to get possession of the Posts in the Upper Country in consequence of the Treaty of Peace, I have thought it my duty uniformly to oppose the same untill His Majesty’s orders for that purpose shall be received, and my conduct upon that occasion, having been approved as you write see by the inclosed Extract of a Letter from His Majesty’s Ministers of State, I have only to recommend to you a strict attention to the same which will be more than ever necessary, as uncommon Returns of Furrs from the Upper Country this year have increased the anxiety of the Americans to become Masters of it, and have prompted them to make sacriﬁces to the Indians for that purpose. Whenever this event may happen you will be particularly careful to attend to that part of the Extract relating to Military Stores 8: Pro- visions and upon no account whatever permit any species of either to be left in the Evacuated Posts, but there is no doubt that the most pointed Instructions upon this head will accompany the order for delivering up the Posts. You are acquainted in my Letter No 7 that I had a view to this Event in establishing the Post of Cataraqui, to which place the Ord- nance Provisions & Stores can by means of the vessels be very easily conveyed unless Posts are to be occupied opposite to the Present within the Line.

270 HALDIMAND PAPERS MEMORIAL OF DAVISON AND LEES OF QUEBEC To His Excelly &c The Memorial of Davison & Lees‘ of Quebec, Merchants, Humbly Sheweth That your memorialists in the month of August last presented to your Excellency a Bill drawn on you by the Hon Patrick Sinclair Esquire, Lieut Governor of Michilimackinac, in favour of Alex McKay and endorsed to your memorialists for Two Thousand Pounds N. York Currency, which was protested for non payment the 14b of Oct following. That at the time of the Bill being protested, your memorialists were informed by Richard Mathews Equ your Excellency’s Secretary, to whom they presented it for payment that the Reason of its being refused payment was that it was drawn after that Lieut Governor Sinclair had received orders from your Excellency to make no more Purchases at Michilimackinac of goods for the use of the Indians as appeared by a copy of the order given by Lieut Gov Sinclair to A Kay bearing date the 19h of July 1782, forwarded to your Excellency by said A. Kay at the same time with Lieut Governor Sinclair‘s Letter advising you of the Bill. That your memorialists have been since informed by the said Alex Kay (who was not at that period returned from Mich“) that the Bill was drawn for the payment of goods delivered by him to the Indians in the Illinois Country in obedience to an order from Lieut Gov. Sin- clair bearing date at Michilimackinac the 19h June 1781 prior to his receiving orders, as your memorialists are informed, to desist from purchasing goods for the use of the Indians. Your memorialists further beg leave to represent to your Excellency that the said Alex Kay set out from Michilimackinac for the Illinoi Country in the beginning of July 1781, from whence he did not return to Michilimackinac till the summer 1782 when he received this bill from Lieut Governor Sinclair in payment of goods he had delivered to the Illinois Indians in obedience to the before mentioned order, and that there i an error in the date of the copy of the order forwarded to your Excellency which your memorialists apprehend was dated of the day that the copy was forwarded from Michilimackinac instead of having copied on it the usual date of the order. “Michilimackinac 19h June 1781” as appears by the original order delivered to your Excellency.

276 HALDIMAND PAPERS LT. GOV. PATRICK SINCLAIR TO GEN. FREDERICK HALDIMAND SIR Although the appearance of the highest authority may be borrowed or procured to countenance every step, from the settlement of the ﬁrst public accounts which, under your command, I gave my signature to it can never lessen my zealous attachment. The artless bounty of the American Savage may be seized in Newgate (with the best design) under the authority of Civil Law. The means may be thus wrested from me of working up every paternal acre. The detention of Lieutenant Lord 47h Regt. in Canada for the purpose of examining; the imputation of disobedience of orders. & the manner in which I was sent from Quebec might have pointed out to another the Road to His Prince, his profession and to public ofﬁces—These circumstances however, did not prompt me to ask every way where very naturally I should have gone had it not been barred against me. Give me leave Sir, to expect that this day will ﬁnish the disagree- able business of accounts and that I shall be at liberty to attend to my impaired health, for a while; Be assured that untill then I will not rush into the presence of a superior with the foul air of a prison nor will I avoid public service when I can be useful to it. Lord Viscount Sackville will certainly expect no apology for my not making my case known to him as His Lordship is not in administration—I hope Sir I have no reason to dwell upon this doubt I have the honour to be Sir . _ Your most obedient London and most humble Servant Saturday Noon PA'I'I‘ SINCLAIR [Date probably in 1785.] Endorsed :— From Lt. Govr ' St. Clair. [B 205, p 360] ADAM MABANE TO GEN. FREDERICK HALDIMAND QUEBEC Jany 5th 1786. DR GENERAL—Since I did myself the honor to write you via N. York Mr. Annchuger has arrived wt ye October mail from England. Many Letters of yt opportunity mention the event which Major Mathews tells me as also determined upon, as having actually taken place. If the appointments for this country made in consequence of that event
Page 277
ADAM MABANE TO GEN. HALDIMAND 277 are such as are given out here, there has been but little moderation 8: delicacy observed in them. The seditious begin to recover from the astonishment and apprehensions which the Renewal of Lt Govl‘ Ham- ilton had occasioned but I still entertain hopes that they will ﬁnd their Expectations frustrated, and that they will receive no countenance from your successor, in ye mean time their Exultation is great and tho’ ye principals know the contrary they do not fail to inculcate amongst p the people that the Revolution has been brought about by their com- ’plaints agt. you, are opinioas, which tho’ at present may he laughed at and despised, may upon some future occasion be useful to ye pur- poses of sedition & Rebellion, for people will not be very fond of sup- porting Government, when they ﬁnd that the most certain method of being rewarded is to be an enemy to it. Mr. White of Sorrel is arrived.

We are persuaded they would not have it in their power, as the Indians would only prevent it but probably take the lives of many British Subjects, encouraged by the hope of plunder 8: stimulated by resentment for their Country being given up to the very people. against whom they have been encouraged to carry on the war, and whom they consider at this time as their most inveterate enemies & from our knowledge of the temper of the Indians, we will venture to say it would be agreeable to Humanity as well as good Policy, for the United States not to wish possession of the Posts at an earlier Period, and it will probably be the Interest of both Countries to unite in this measure, as the means of preventing the horrors & cruelties of an Indian War. 3d That no Tax, or Impost whatever, should be laid on any articles of Commerce, passing or repassing through the Country for the space of three years, but that the Trade may be left entirely open for the beneﬁt of all parties interested therein.

The Navigation of the Lakes by Kings Vessels only, is an object so nearly connected with the entire preservation of the Furr Trade,

NAMES OF TRADERS TO THE UPPER COUNTRY 279 that I have withstood various applications for building 8: navigating private Vessels and Boats upon the Lakes the Rivers & Outlets from them to the American States are numerous that, no precautions that could be taken, in that case, would be effectual in preventing a great part of the Furrs from going directly into the American States. and there is but little doubt that Traders will carry their commodities to the best Market, whatever may be the consequences; indeed several instances have already occurred since the Peace of their smuggling Furrs even from Montreal, over Lake Champlain into the States, not withstanding the vigilance of the Civil and military ofﬁcers; what then would be the case upon the remote Lakes, may easily be conceived—I would therefore recommend, by all means, that a sufﬁcient number of King’s Vessels be kept up upon the Lakes, and all other craft what- ever prohibited, not only for the foregoing Reason, but, in all events, to preserve a superiority upon the waters in that country. Having from motives of economy reduced the Marine Department in some degree below the Establishment that may be found necessary for all the purposes of the Transport, such arrangements should be made as will leave the merchants no room to complain. which I ﬁnd they are inclined to do, as a pretext for their application to navigate in their own vessels or thro’ some trivial neglect might have happened in the course of the War, they cannot occur in times of Peace. Should this Plan be approved, it will be necessary to place an ofﬁcer of the Royal Navy at the Head of that Department, who has a local knowledge of the services, and who will take the trouble to discharge the duty faithfully—I know one, who, if he will undertake it, I am satisﬁed from a long experience, of his abilities & assiduity as well as his disinterested sentiments, will give perfect satisfaction. The Ofﬁcer I would recommend is Captain Chambers who commanded upon Lake Champlain during the War.

I write this in advance, for the ﬁrst ship that sails from hence, when I dare say you will hear at large from your unalterable, zealous Friend Mr. Mabane, who is at present not in the most pleasant temper of mind, having just ﬁnished a very warm and not a very successful campaign—it opened by a very violent attack, from a late cummer high in ofﬁce, against the system of the whole Legislature. of the Province, bearing particularly hard upon the Court of Common Pleas not only in Points of Forms 8:. regularity but in Judgments which have for years past been given—You will have the particulars professionally related & with more precision than my knowledge can go to. The out- lines however I just wish to trace to you myself that you may not (which is very natural) lean too much to, or from the Prejudices of our Friend who is sanguine on his correspondence as well as in con- versation. The whole Tenor of Mr. S’s (Smith)1 conduct proves that he came to this country violently prejudiced against him, in a great measure, no doubt, from his constant intercourse while in London with Mr. G—t, (Grant?)2 and not less so against the adoption of the French Laws, which were attempted to be overset by surprise and a coup-de-main, to precipitate however to have, at that time. any other effect than to show the Inclination, and put those of the opposite opinion upon their guard—they met him upon his own ground, and worsted him completely—Petitions from the French of all descriptions headed by the Patriots (even Roshblave)a came forth praying that no sanction might be given to the proceedings in agitation. A Bill intended to be brought in by Mr. S. (Smith?) was previously printed in French and dispersed thro’ the Province—it had a very different effect from what was intended, and was thrown out by a majority (tho’ a very feeble one) headed by the Lt. Gov“. The death of the Bantling exasperated the Parent of it and his Friends so much that a protest was the consequence, signed (but not written. and I fear scarce read by some) by the Dissenting members—who they were I need not tell you, H—d (Holland?) excepted, who has been blessed‘ with a new light. The violence 8: rankour of this Protest do little Honour to the Hearts 8: Hands of the Subscribers, tho’ great credit to the Head which produced it—it naturally occasioned very high debates. some of which ran to Personalities, and great severity indeed of the most moderate, however, was the most injured. the poor Drs A Bill was then brought in by St 0.

(Monk?) being A. G. (Attorney General) c. undertook the cause without Fee or Reward and in a speech of six hours long employed six of them in arraigning the Ordinances, Court of Appeals, and common Pleas, for two years back, charging the judges with partiality, thro’ grace and favour, in their Judgements, delays, neglects, want of knowledge &c. &c. &c. emptyed a party bucket of very foul stuff of two years standing—but he spoke with the advantage of having no antagonist. and of course with temporary impu- nity—a day or two after Mr. S. (Smith) moved that the Judges should be brought forward to defend the high charges speciﬁed against them by the A. G. and clear the reputation of their Bench—this was imme- diately followed by a motion on the part of the Judges to end for the A. G. (Attorney General) & charge him with having advanced the charges before mentioned & put him upon a Proof of them—this was thrown out but a motion very similar to it was carried, and the gentle- man condescended to appear, but not without apologizing for so doing (from his respect for the Board) because he said the order was not addressed to him on that occasion, he was not A. G. be was Mr. M. (Monk) a private advocate. He was aked if he avowed having in his speech charged the Judges as above. He said that he would give the House an answer, but that he must ﬁrst consult with his clients, in two Days he gave his answer, which was quite in character, evasive and little satisfactory—The Council assembled at the chateau 8: ad- dressed his Lordship to give such orders in the matter as he should think ﬁt to bring Mr. M. (Monk) to proof—but I can see it will end in noth- ing—whereas he deserves not only to be dismissed but to be put in the Pillory & whipped out of the Province—The Speech was a con- certed one, and breathed sentiments which had fallen from another quarter tho’ in more moderate and reserved Language, nothing more has been done in the matter, but it must soon be decided in one way or another. After this business Party seemed to moderate, and a sort of conciliatory Bill was proposed by the Lt. Govr which embraced such parts of the C. J.

It is fortunate you thought of giving Chandler every power I have, for tomorrow I sett oﬁ for Detroit. Accounts from that Quarter being represented to wear a very gloomy aspect.

He received my proposal in the manner my most sanguine wish could expect, but would not hear of my quitting my situation and has instructed me to return in the Fall if circumstances will permit. He has also charged me with various enquiries & business which will fully employ me for the summer should not the Americans and Indians ﬁnd some other amusement for me. The latter (even Joseph from whom I had a letter) are satisﬁed, or aﬂ’ect to be so, that the Americans are determined to possess themselves of the Posts; and though they have now War Parties out upon their Frontiers, they talk very seriously of neutrality. Their disgust at the part we have acted in neglecting them in the Treaty of Peace, is ever uppermost & to that they ascribe all their present distress.

' Your Excellency will have learned, without doubt, that Major Mathews left this spring (with the consent of Lord Dorchester) to go & take the command of Detroit—it gave me pleasure that he stayed _ with me a couple of days in passing & gave me your news & told me ~that Your Excellency would write by Mr Dunn to some persons to whom you are attached in this country & I ﬂattered myself to be of the number but behold the vessels are all arrived with the exception of the Loudres (in which is Lady Dorchester) which I think is at the shore 8: I have received no letter. But I think if Your Excellency had had the goodness to honor me with some tokens they could have been put under cover of Major Mathews to whom I have written on the subject & wait his answer with impatience. Since the Spring it is publickiy said that Lord Amherst would be put in posession of the “cures” of the Jesuits in Canada 8: that the King’s patent to this effect has been sent to His Excellency the Governor to be put before his council at Quebec. As I presume that my Lord would need some one in this country for the protection Of a property so large & so scattered, I take the liberty of asking you very humbly in case you approve of it, to inter- est yourself in my favour. My long residence in this province having given me time to acquire the enlightenment necessary for such trans- actions—I imagine that I could ﬁll all the duties devolving upon me with integrity & exactness in their interests; & if by your intercession I could obtain this favor from Lord Amherst it would determine me to pass the rest of my days in a country which I love 8: where I ﬂatter myself I am so well known as to ﬁnd persons there to vouch ‘See appendix.

I said that I hoped he would not attempt to do me that favor for I should certainly roll him in his Blanket & throw him out of the window, so that if we do not grow rich, we shall at least remain untainted in our respectable son, (sic) which I am very sorry to say has not been the case always at these Posts.

I lately received letters from General Hope & Mabane both are very happy receipt of Letters from their Friends in England, the latter I think less sanguine on this occasion than the former, who I believe has too favorable an opinion of his late messenger, a young man, I believe much attached and well disposed—but sanguine in his colouring & always known to possess the privilege of a Traveler in a high degree. The manner in which the conduct of his Friend was received in England gives me for many reasons great satisfaction the accounts of it arrived in good time to establish or rather reestablish him in the system—for towards the latter part of the business the abilities of the Leader of the other Party & cunning of his adherents had awed him & he began to give ground & you may suppose, conse- quently to lose the esteem of a certain man who is not to be shaken, I fought the battle often with him, & I rather think prevented a. rupture, they will now of course reunite & it is with pleasure I tell you, Sir, that I think the violent ardour of our Friend seems to abate. I confess I have still my apprehensions for him, and my fears that his opponent is supported by some secret spring that will not fail him or his purpose. Capt. Genevay goes on very well hi sterling worth cannot fail to support him, and I believe that he is convinced that your advice to him was more salutary than his Friend General Christy’s he is in great anxiety for the honor of a few lines from you upon some subject which he mentioned to you some time ago. May I request, Sir, that when- ever you are so indulgent as to let me have the happiness of hearing from or of you, that you will be pleased to let Freeman know your wishes respecting your Picture which I mentioned to you Mabane has strongly solicited for it. 8:. I could wish also that my letters particu- larly by the Packet were put under cover to Davidson 8: Lees for I confess I never much liked our Post Ofﬁce.

292 HALDIMAND PAPERS year, by which it appears that he has not decided yet. He tells me that a considerable party of the Americans are advancing by the road of the River Wabashe & by the Ohio, perhaps that detains him longer than I would think, he does not tell me however that they have any design on the Post of Detroit but simply that their intention is to frighten the Indians & compel them to consent to the establishment of a chain of posts which they have planned in these parts. If we believe the news last spread at Niagara by the American Surveyors the latter have entirely defeated a large party at the \Vabashe, but as the Major has said nothing to me in his letter we have good reason to believe the news false. Perhaps Major Mathews has said something in the letter which he sent to Captain Freeman by this opportunity. Nothing has yet been decided in the case of Gugy by the Court of Appeals. I fear I would tire your Excellency by giving the details of this unhappy lawsuit & of the events which followed it. I will conﬁne myself to giving some of the principal facts which will give you an idea of the conduct of this woman & the advocates. After the jury had given their report or verdict of £7000 Halifax currencyl damages to Sieur Dueme, the advocates of the Countess asked the Court to sus- pend judgment & do away with the verdict & take it before a new body of jurymen until they had time to make an appeal at Quebec but after many proceedings they could not ﬁnd the necessary security (which was double the sum). During this interval Duemes advocates had neglected nothing to obtain judgment in consequence of the ver- dict and the court were obliged to grant it against the St Maurice forges, buildings, tools, iron, ore &c. &c. &c. As I had seen for a long time that Mr. Gugy always tried to arrange our account 8: to come to a decisive settlement. I had proposed to him to give me Forges which left after his death a balance of £892-12-4 Halifax Currency. I assert that at that time this passed between us & I was informed after his ‘ death on the opening of the will that all had been left to the Countess during her life, & that it_had been left a long time before the illness in which Gugy mentioned me & signed the agreement which I had made for the Society. I was still more convinced when at the com- mencement of September 1786 to make arrangements with a. notary, the Countess & the clerk of the forges refused to show the account books saying they were not there 8: the clerk at the same time told us that he had never heard that I had any share except from Jones, before Mr. Gugy left on his last voyage to Montreal he said to him that he had promised a ﬁfth or a sixth but without saying any thing ‘ of my advances. As I saw as much rascality from the one as from the lt'f. ante p. 48.

CAPT. GENEVAY TO GEN. HALDIMAND 293 other & as I could not prove the (Societe) without producing the letters which are ﬁlled with invectives against ditt'erent people & being always prevented by the friends of the Countess having sworn to expose all your letters as well as mine which she had in her possession besides the certainty of the immense expenses of a long drawn out law suit. I would rather have made a sacriﬁce than gone to extremes had not the lawyers & my notary engaged to make an agreement in writing to deliver into the hands of persons I should name as much of the effects & produce of the forges as would make double the sum due to me on condition that I renounced all my claims on the (Societe) company. If this had been arranged I would have been very happy but after waiting ﬁve months I only received a little more than half 8: could get no more. Perhaps they had seen for four or ﬁve years that those goods which came from Scotland were much better. In January last the Countess seeing the time ﬁxed for the sale of the seigniorys & other lands approaching made an agreement with the Sieur Daeme 8: Mr. Lees by which she was to receive a pension of two or three hundred Louis during the rest of her life 8: another clause in the agreement that I was to wait for payment of the sum due me 8: she bound herself not to interfere in the sale of the effects in my possession but was not willing to add to it another article. During the sitting of the Council last winter they passed a new ordonnance to regulate the administration & there was a clause in it which authorized them to form an appeal to the Governor or Council without giving notice to the plaintiﬁ' as obliged by the old ordonnance. I have heard that Madame the Countess with the assistance of her lawyers had endeavoured to break the contract with her opponents 8: try if the Court of Appeal would not give a more favourable verdict than that of the Court of Common Pleas. It appears that this law suit will totally ruin that large fortune which Gugy’s parents left, 8:. it .appears as if his brother does not care as he has never answered any of the letters which have been written to him. I 'ask a thousand pardons, dear general for having troubled you so long on this subject, as Your Excellency appears interested in the part that I have unhappily had in it 8: believed to be my duty always assuring you that if you will continue to honor me with your protec- tion that I will always seek to merit it. I have nothing further to trouble Your Excellency with this time.

[B 77, p 203] AREN'I‘ SCHUYLER DE PEYSTER Mr Douglas Brymner, of Ottawa, has furnished the following extracts from Chambers’ Life of Burns Vol. 4 which will shew some of Colonel de Peysters pursuits after he left the Army and settled in Dumfries in Scotland. In the early part of 1795, two companies of volunteers were raised by Dumfries, as its quota toward the stationary troops which were found necessary at that crisis, when the regular army was chieﬁy engaged in maintaining external warfare against France. Burns joined the corps. ' ‘I remember well’, says Cunningham, ‘the appearance of that respectable corps; their odd, but not ungraceful dress; white Kersey- mere breeches and waistcoat; short blue coat, faced with red and round hat, surmounted by a bearskin, like the helmets of our Horseguards, and I remember the poet also—his very swarthy face, his ploughman stoop, his large dark eyes and his indifferent dexterity in the handling of his arms.’ War oﬁice March 24 (1795) Dumfriesshire corps of volunteers.

On the King’s birthday, a set of colours, prepared by Mrs. De Peyster wife of the commandant, was presented in a ceremonious manner to the Dumfries Volunteers, in the square where the Duke of Queens- berrys Monument stands. The Rev. Mr. Burnside. one of the clergy- men of the town, said a prayer on the occasion, and complimented the corps on its good discipline, which he said had been mainly owing to De Peyster’s assiduity in drilling. At four o’clock the whole volunteers, and a number of other gentlemen, were entertained at dinner in the King’s Arms by the magistrates; and at ﬁve the company

The whole day was spent in the utmost harmony; 8:c—Dumfries Journal, June 9, 1795. On the occasion of his Commander sending to make some kind inquiries about his health, Burns replied in rhyme: To Colonel De Pewter: My honored Colonel, deep I feel Your interest in the poet's weal; Ah! now sma' heart hae l to speel The steep Parnassus, Surrounded thus by bolus pill, And potion glasses. 0 what a canty warld were it, Would pain and care and sickness spare it: And fortune favor worth and merit, As they deserve!

But lest you think I am uncivil, To plague you with this draunting drivel, Abjuring a” intentions evil, I quat my pen: The Lord preserve us free the devil! Amen ! Amen ! The following note is appended— "Colonel Arentz Schulyer (Schuyler) de Peyster died at Dumfries in November 1832, at the age it was believed of ninety-six or ninety-seven years. He had held the royal commission for about eighty years. In early life he commanded at Detroit, Michilimackinac, and other parts of Upper Canada, during the seven years’ war, when be distinguished himself by detaching the Indians from the service of the French. To pursue an obituary notice in the Dumfries Courier: ‘The deceased also served in various other parts of North America under his uncle, Colonel Schulyer, (Schuyler) and after being promoted to the rank of Colonel, and commanding for many years the 8th Regiment, he retired to Dumfries, the native town of Mrs. De Peyster, the faithful follower of his fortunes in every situation—in camp and in quarters—amidst savage tribes and polished communities—in the most distant stations of Upper Canada, as well as in walled and garrisoned cities. Indeed, we may here state, without the slightest qualiﬁcation, that there never was a more venerable and tenderly-attached pair. For more than ﬁfty years, they shared the same bed, without having been separated in any one instance; and altogether the gallant old Colonel’s bearing to his faith- ful and long-cherished spouse, resembled more what we ween of the age of chivalry, than the altered, and, as we suspect, not improved manners of the present times.” “ ‘In his person Colonel De Peyster was tall, soldier-like, and com- manding; in his manners. easy, alfable and open; in his aifections, warm, generous, and sincere; in his principles, and particularly his political principles, ﬁrm even to inﬂexibility. No man, we believe, ever possessed more of the principle of vitality. Old age, which had silvered his hair, and furrowed his cheeks, appeared to make no impression on his inner man. and those who knew him best declare
Page 299
ARENT SCHUYLER DE PEYSTER. 299 that, up to the period of his last illness, his mind appeared as active, and his intellect as vigorous as they were ﬁfty years ago. When the weather permitted, he still took his accustomed exercise, and walked round the billiard table, or bestrode his gigantic charger, apparently with as little difﬁculty as a man of middle age. \Vhen so mounted, we have often fancied we beheld in him the last connecting link betwixt the old and new schools of military men.” The following from the New American Cycloptedia: Arent Schuyler De Peyster, a colonel in the British army, born in New York June 27, 1736, died at Dumfries, Scotland, in Nov. 1832. He entered the 8th or kings regiment of foot in 1755, served in various parts of North America under his uncle, Col. Peter Schuyler, and commanded at Detroit, Michilimackinac and various places in Upper Canada during the American revolutionary war. The Indian tribes of the north-west were then decidedly hostile to the British government, but the prudent measures adopted by Col. De Peyster tended to con- ciliate and ﬁnally to detach them entirely from the American cause. To his inﬂuence over the Indians several American missionaries and their families were on one occasion indebted for the preservation of their lives. Having risen to the rank of colonel and commanded his regiment for many years, he retired to Dumfries, the native town of his wife, where he resided until his death. During the French revolu- tion he was instrumental in embodying and training the 1st regiment of Dumfries volunteers, of which Robert Burns was an original member. He was on terms of friendship with Burns, who addressed to him one of his fugitive pieces, and with whom he once carried on a poetical controversy in the columns of the “Dumfries Journal.” He died as full of honor as of years, having held the king’s commission upward of 77 years, and being probably at the time the oldest ofﬁcer in the service. His nephew Captain Arent Schuyler De Peyster, was an American navigator, who sailed several times around the globe, and in a passage from the western coast of America to Calcutta discovered a group of islands, called after him the De Peyster or Peyster islands.

From hence you will know that the power of granting Lands at the Detroit, remains solely in the King, and that no purchase can be made of Indians but with the King’s permission and authority. It may be needless after the above Explanation to inform you that all Grants made by Lieut Colonel Gladwin, Major Bruce or any other British Commander are null and void and of no value. As for the French Grants in general, unless approved of by the Governor General of Canada and registered accordingly they were not valid; but as for Monsieur Belestl'e’s Grants1 in the year 1760 they cannot be deemed any other than fraudulent, and are by no means to be looked upon as valid, and as for the Indian purchases, they are not allowed by the French nor are they allowed by the English Gov- ernment but under the Restrictions I have already mentioned. Monsieur I\'avarre’s2 Declaration or Certiﬁcate may be in part true, but it is not the whole truth, the ﬁrst Settlers with Monsieur Sabrevoix were not, perhaps enjoined to the conditions imposed afterwards, respecting their Titles, the Government was glad to get any people to begin the Settlement. But Monsieur Navarre‘s conclusion is vague and ill founded, I am well informed in these matters. was three years in possession of the Books wherein the Titles were registered, and received Information upon them. The very time in which Monsieur B'elestre’s grants, were made, sufﬁciently points out their being invalid, and that they could not be registered when the whole government of Canada was on the point of surrendering to the King, and the Capital possess- ed by his Troops, so early as September 1759; Monsieur Belestre was not ignorant of these circumstances and his grants are fraudulent. I am now to require of you as soon as this is received to annul and make void by Public Act, every concession made by Monsieur Belestre in the year 1760, every Grant made by any British Commander with- out exception, and all Indian Purchases whatever, or Indian Deeds not obtained by the King’s permission and authority, and that you do not suifer any settlements to be made with the above Titles, or any new Settlements to be begun, on any pretence whatever, and that you pull dovvn as fast a any Persons shall presume to build up, and that you do seize and send down the Country all Persons who shall be endeav- oring to settle among the Savages. lSee Vol. XXXIV. pp. 336-340. this series. 2See Vol. XXXIV, p. 136, this series.

GEN. GAGE TO CAPT. STEPHENSON 303 I imagine the Indians will be set upon, to talk to you upon these Subjects, you will answer them that the King is tender of their prop— erty, and has made regulations to prevent their being cheated and defrauded; that His Majesty has been induced to make these Rules, upon the frequent complaints of the Indians against the White People, who have defrauded them of their Lands by making a few of them drunk, and getting them in that condition, to give away their Country, to the great disgust of the rest of the Nations, and by such means,‘ the Indians have represented, that the white People have taken great part of their hunting grounds, this has happened to many Indian Nations, and unless you stop it in the beginning at the Detroit the same thing will happen there. . Mr. Grant has engaged to build two Vessels for the King, in which business you will please to assist him and give him such helps as your garrison affords, whenever he shall demand it, as for the merchants they may build what vessels they please but you will not suffer either Mr Grants Artiﬁcers or Sailors to be taken from him, you have acted very properly in that respect already. I understand there is very good Cedar to be had which Mr Grant will now use for the King’s Vessels, and if you ﬁnd it necessary, you will reserve the cedar and suffer no person to cut it, but when it is used in the King’s Service. I hope that you have received the orders about ﬁtting out the old Vessels for this years Service.

Some time after our Brothers the ﬁve Nations arrived here with Speeches from you, wherein you make mention of several things which make us think you spoke from your heart. but even then you did not tell us all we expected, however we took hold of these Speeches. You told us if we had any grievances to redress, you would remove them, & that as you placed these Forts there, you could also destroy them. but, Brother, you have spoke to us again and have taken no notice of these things, nor of any thing which the Confederate Nations, assembled here last fall, told you. You desire us to call in our young men, we desire you also to call in yours, as you ﬁrst proposed terms of accommodation. Our young men cannot be restrained till they see you taking steps to give up your encroachments on our Lands; they are obliged to watch you in their own defence: the hostilities committed are not owing to us, but to yourselves; notwithstanding in the mean time we shall call in all our war parties and endeavour as much as is in our power to prevent any further hostilities. because we sincerely wish for peace if upon Just

CLARKE NAVY HALL July 24 1793 SIR I do myself the honor of writing to your Excellency to represent that there is no person in this part of the Country who can interpret the. Missisagua language; in consequence Mr St. John Russeau.1 has always been sent for. from Toronto when any business has been to be transacted with the Lake Indians. Mr. Lyons the regular Interpreter at Kingston is too distant from the seat of government, and appears to me in all respects a most inef- ﬁcient person. I was lately obliged to send for St. John, when the Western Indians were here. at the request of the Mohawks whose language he speaks, that he might return with them to the Council, this, he was unable to perform on account of the impracticability of quitting his mercantile concerns for so long a season. The probability of the seat of government of this Province being for a time established at York; and the almost certainty of that post becoming a ﬂourishing Mart of Trade, will occasion it to be the rende- vouz of most of those Indians on the north of Lake Huron, who now go to Michillimackinac. and strengthens the necessity of there being an Interpreter to assist the Commanding oﬁicer. St. John appears to me to have all the requisition necessary for that ofﬁce. and is equally agreeable to Brandt and the Mohawks, as to the Messisagua’s; He seems indeed to be the only person who possesses any great degree of inﬂuence with either of those Nations and must unavoidably be employed by me on contingent Expenses, if not at an actual Salary, in all those expeditions I shall ﬁnd myself obliged to take to obtain an accurate knowledge of the communications between the Lakes Huron and Ontario.

This informant saye he was a soldier in the second United States Regiment, and deserted from the Army encamped at a Bridge six miles on this side Fort Jefferson on Tuesday the 12h Instant. That the said army consists of about 2,500 men and that when he left it, they had nearly ﬁnished Huts to serve as Winter Quarters, that it was intended immediately after the Huts should be completed to build a log fort round the whole, that the Militia Forces amounting to about 1200, had returned home ﬁve days before he deserted. That at the time he left the Army there was not more than 18 or 20 days Provisions for it, but that an escort was preparing to be sent to fort Washington to get some forward. That the loss of their horses taken by the Indians, and by death, has occasioned the scarcity and delayed the movements of the Army, and that it was owing to the smallness of the Ration which caused his deserting and two other who accompanied him called Charles Whiting and IValdrum. lWayne's Army, see appendix.

I have the honor to transmit herewith a copy of the principal Trans- actions with 260 Chiefs & Warriors of the Six Nations who brought here two Senicas concerned in a murder committed last year on four French men on Lake Ontario as mentioned in my Letter No. 6; which Persons contrary to antient custom I made a point of their delivering up to justice, and having at length prevailed they are now committed to the county Goal where they are to remain till I hear from General Haldimand, who some time since joyned me in opinion that on their making restitution for the goods they Plundered at that time it would at this juncture be good policy to discharge them, in consideration of the many murders committed on their people for which no satisfaction could be obtained and of the youth of the Parties who were inﬂueneed thereto by a fellow who ﬂed; Besides it being considered as an act of Clemency there were no Proofs to convict them neither could restitution be expected if they suffered which would have proved very injurious to the Merchants whose goods were taken. Indeed this is the ﬁrst instance wherein the Senicas were ever pre- vailed on to sacriﬁce their antient customs to our Laws by delivering up offenders and therefore I hope it will Establish a good' and whole- some Precedent, without even carrying it to the utmost rigor of the Laws.

By the enclosed speech of General Wayne’s1 which I got from the Partner of Wilson,2 who was interpreter to the Messengers you will perceive that the Delawares have sent a Message to the American Army respecting peace, none of the other Nations as I am Informed were acquainted with the real design of this Message until the return of the Runners who carried it, but I understand they have since agreed to hold a Council to deliberate thereon & I have sent a conﬁdential person to attend the result of that Council, which I will not fail to communicate to you for the Information of His Excellency the Com- mander in Chief by the most expeditious mode which the nature of the Country will admit of at this season of the year, being of opinion from the Jealousies and divisions sown among the Nations last summer, that the opposition to the American Army establishing themselves in this Country is every day growing less and it is now very likely they will be able to accomplish it in a very short time.

Mr. Sheehan’s absence at present prevents my sending a copy of the answer from the Americans to the Indians in consequence of the Council at Buffaloe Creek, but it shall wait on you by the ﬁrst conveyance in the spring as also a copy of the Proceedings’ at the Glaize &ca.

The Store will be deﬁcient of many articles required by the two Requisitions enclosed, and the expected supplies will not furnish the whole of the Demands particularly Blankets, the demands for that Article in both Requisitions is uncommonly Large, indeed the whole of the Requisitions are so, Captain Doyle and Mr. Lamothe give reasons for those for Michili- mackinac. and doubtless Colo.

It appears to me that it never was the intention that a meeting should take place between the American Commissioners1 and us—but what the motive may be for the disappointment time must unfold, and as for my part I was clearly prepared for the business and from apparent circumstances we had nothing to dread from an interview, as I have the vanity to think that I should never have assented to any proceedings by which His Majesty’s interest might have received the least injury, indeed am sorry to inform you that my feelings are much hurt when I seriously consider everything, as conjectures might arise that no conﬁdence was placed in me, and for that very reason I would have taken pleasure to evince to the contrary, by that uniform con- duct which I ever wish to pursue where any thing may be expected at my hands, when the Six Nations returned from Miami last season we sent to Congress proposals of having Maskingum River the Boundary Line, but as we received an evasive answer it is not in my power to inform you what the intention of congress is respecting this Business, as they said they must deliberate on the matter notwithstanding we required but a short answer from them Yes or No. We are now going to hold a council at Buifaloe Creek and as Congress has not sent an answer to our proposals, it is my opinion that the ﬁve Nations (of which the council is to consist) will not attend the proposed treaty at Venango. and I cant conceive it will tend to a. great purpose as prob- ably those of the Five Nations now on the Genesee &c (after the council) will immediately remove on this side Niagara River, but my next letter will give you further knowledge of this business.

I therefore humbly submit it to His Lordship, whether the Storekeeper General may be allowed to send any of the latter articles in lieu of the former, taking care that the amount does not exceed that of the Different Articles, and making an exact Return of those issued that are not mentioned in the Requisition: I am much surprised at Colonel Butlers not making a requisition for the articles wanted for the Post of Niagara perhaps he may send it by Captain Brant’s Express. I am with great truth Dear Sir - Yours most sincerely Thomas Aston Coffin Esq. JOSEPH CHEW [C 247, p 96] 43

338 INDIAN AFFAIRS JOSEPH CHEW TO THOMAS ASTON COFFIN MONTREAL 711 April .1794 SIR, - I know of but one Instance where the Supt Intendant General put Government to the Expence of Canoe and that way paying for a very ordinary one for the late Captain David which he got at Oswegatchie at a time he came from Grand River on particular Business. Several Indian Expresses came to him and returned without requiring such a transport; when Capt. Brant and the W'estern Deputies came down in 1791, they were supplied with Batteaux at Kingston but had neither . guides nor steersmen and they returned with the same boats which they delivered at Kingston with the Implements belonging to them, from your letter I suppose (.‘olonel Campbell means to send six Indians to Michilimackinac with His Lordship’s Reply, if so the least expensive way is to let them have a boat to go to Kingston there to be delivered to the commissary, and they to cross the Lake in the King‘s Vessels. I apprehend they might manage the boat themselves, but should two men be supplied to go with them to Kingston the expence will be triﬂing to what it must amount to if Colonel Campbell’s method is adopted, and the Reply be sent to the oﬂicer commanding at Mackinac for him to deliver to the Indians there, in any other way than by Indians. I would undertake it would go safe and with more dispatch, and not put Government to one Farthing Expence, I will get the best Information I can respecting the Oneidas, and now inclose you Requisitions for the glass & nails for the Church 8: School House at Bay de Quinte, and for nails for packing the Presents for the Upper Posts and am Sir Your most obedient humble Servant JOSEPH CHEW Thomas Aston Coffn [C 247, p 98] CAPT.

CAPT. M'KEE TO JOSEPH CHEW 339 ing the 7 Nations of Canada. and the latter desiring an account of the provisions delivered to the Indians of Lower Canada, who attended the Councils at the Miamis. It is extremely painful to me, to be the subject of complaint, altho’ conscious of its being altogether unmerited. but I have the consola- tion of possessing unequivocal proofs, of the groundless assertions of the 7 Nations of Canada, on the present occasion. On their arrival at Niagara. His Excellency the Lieutenant Governor, appointed Lieut Talbot to conduct them to the Rapids. and to remain with them dur- ing the time of the Council, so that he will be perfectly competent to state. for the information of His Excellency the Commander in. Chief. what their treatment was. while they remained at the Rapids, I shall of course by this opportunity write to Mr. Talbot and request of him, to give you his sentiments and observations, while they were under his charge. I shall also request the favour of Colonel England.1 to state to you. the event of a memorial, made by the 7 Nations of Canada to him on their return from the Rapids (a copy of which memorial is herewith enclosed). By that Memorial they themselves agree. they were at least used like other Nations while Mr. Talbot remained with them. so that it appears from thence; their complaints were directed either to a period antecedent to their arrival at the Rapids or after they left the Council, for Mr. Talbot remained with us some time after they were gone. When the 7 Nations arrived the greater part of them were almost naked, their equipments must of course have been disposed of on the way up. I was therefore under the necessity of sending to Detroit for cloathing to cover them 8: make them comfortable and in consideration of the difference in their manner of living from that of the other Nations. they were supplied mostly with Flour and pork or fresh beef when the other nations had only corn or peas with it, they had their Rations regularly during the whole time of their stay and suﬂicient to carry them to Detroit after the Council was over. I trust His Excellency when he shall have received Mr. Talbot‘s and Colo. England’s reports on this business will be persuaded that the complaints of the Seven Nations of Canada as far as it respects me is altogether groundless, but it is perfectly correspondent to the conduct of some of their nations who attended at the Rapids the pre- ceeding year. these people were also regularly and amply supplied, and always complaining. yet when they went away they had amassed more provisions than they cared to take with them in a Batteau, & abso~ lutely left between two & three Barrels of Corn and Peas in their lLleut.

I a few days ago received a Letter from Colonel McKee stating that the 7 Nations of Canada on their arrival at Montreal, had represented, “that they were under the necessity of disposing of the equipments which were given them by the King their Father at La Chine, previous to their departure last summer for the Western Country, in order to procure provisions. as the Rations allowed, during their attendance at the general Council. were by no means sufﬁcient for their subsistence” and requesting of me, as I had accompanied those Indians from Niagara, and remained with them the whole of the time they resided at this place. to inform you of what particulars. I was acquainted with respecting the above transactions. In the month of June or July last Deputies from the 7 Nations of Canada to the number of about 200 arrived at Niagara. where they immediately held a council with His Excellency Lieut. Governor Sim- coe, at which the Chiefs, and Mr. Lorimer‘ their Interpreter said that there were some of their party who had joined them on their way from Lower Canada. that had not reed any presents, and requested that they might be furnished with the same articles as were delivered to the others at La Chine, to which His Excellency was pleased to promise should be done. and desired that Mr Lanrimier would give in a List of what was necessary. The Chiefs also informed the Governor that their affairs required the immediate return of Mr. Lanrimier to their Villages. and hoped that he would be good enough to send an

McKee different articles of necessaries which were always granted by that gentleman while in possession of them. a I hope Sir, you will have the goodness to pardon the liberty I take in thus intruding upon your time, but as Colonel McKee expressed a wish that I should write to you on this subject.

Above all I have to observe, that should any person or persons endeavour, by any means whatever to disunite you, that person or persons you must look on as your greatest enemy, as you may be certain that nothing but sincere attachment to one another, and a steady conduct enable you to follow the steps of your wise Fore Fathers, in which I hope the great spirit will assist you.

I trust it is not necessary for me to observe that a considerable addition of presents &c in case we should be engaged in a War, will be indispensible. from the great inﬂux of distant Indians and the incapacity of Warriors to provide any cloathing for themselves or fami- lies while so engaged.

Early on the morning of the 3ch of last month the Indians who had collected a force of about 2000 men took & killed 300 pack horses with about 60 drivers near Fort Recovery; these Horses had been brought the day before the Indians arrived loaded with ﬂour—the escort intended for their return had not quitted the Fort when the attack was made on the Pack Horses but they turned out immediately on hearing the ﬁring 8.: were repulsed with the loss of about 50 men and 25 or 30 Troop Horses; the Indians followed them close to the gates of the Fort which they wanted to storm but met with a check from the Loop Holes of the Block Houses and then retired to a secure distance with the loss of 17 men killed and as many wounded—they kept the same position all that day 8: the night following, but from the want of pro- visions and ammunition, were obliged to return to the Glaize, from whence all the Lake Indians as well as those from Michilimackinac have come hither, those latter cannot be prevailed upon to remain having accomplished the cord of their Belts by Scalps and Prisoners, and are going home again—so that instead of deriving any advantage from these People and those of Sagana, the Indians in this part of the country will feel a sensible diminution of their strength by the example they shew all the other Lake Indians as well as those who are here as those who are expected and whom they must meet on their way home. I perceive great danger of the security of His Majesty‘s Posts from the unfortunate separation of the Indians at this Period, but having no authority to stop them or to keep the others together by giving them provisions 8: ammunition over 8: above the ordinary supply, I have only to lament what may shortly be the probable situation of this country; but that I may not neglect any thing on this occasion which I conceive to be my duty, I request of you to represent to His Excel- lency the Commander in Chief that there is an absolute necessity for sending Provisions and ammunition to some convenient place in the vicinity of the glaize, provided His~ Majesty‘s Posts are considered by His Excellency objects of Importance.

TO THOMAS ASTON COFFIN MONTREAL 4h Aug“t 1794 DEAR Sm, Yesterday I received a letter from Mr. Duggan dated at Detroit the 1011 July an Extract of which you have inclosed to be laid before his Lordship, it appears the Indians by attempting the Fort after Defeat- ing Capt. Gibsons party met with a Repulse and some loss. I cannot account for the Mackinac and Lake Indians leaving Miami, several letters from Detroit say they were returning home I hope to have a more particular account of the action at Fort Recovery soon from Colo.

I hope this is a fabricated story void of truth, the same paper says one of the provision vessels that left the Delaware early in July had got into New York, with an account of their falling in with sundry British Men of War supposed to be Admiral Murrays squadron which had taken two of the Fleet & were in pursuit of the Concord Frigate and the merchant men when this vessel made her escape. A gentleman who left New York the 16th the day the above mentioned vessel got in, say the master of her reported that he saw six sail taken as I know how fond they are in the States of Publishing accounts favourable to the French, I don’t credit that they give from Brest.

CAMP NEAR FORT Mums DEAR Sm - 27h Augt. 1794 It was not possible for me sooner to communicate the events which have lately happened in this Country—General Wayne with an Army of near 4000 men (according to the report of deserters) made gradual approaches towards us until his arrival at Roche de Bout on the 17h Inst where he ﬁxed his Head Quarters. on the 18h the Spy May1 was taken who informed the Indians it was intended to attack them the next day, unless the General should determine to build a Fort in which case he would not advance until the day following on the 19h the Indians to the number of 1300 marched early to the most advantageous ground, but a strong detachment of Cavalry only made their appear- ance and retired as soon as the Indians shewed themselves. 0n the 20h the American Army advanced and were first attached by the left of the center of the Indian which extended near three Quarters of a mile obliquely upwards, the Americans soon gave way & a rapid pursuit took place for about a mile where the Indians dis- covered the whole of the American Army Posted to whom they gave Battle retiring slowly before them. during this period, the Wyandots and Ottawas who were on the Right were warmly engaged by the Americans left consisting of both Cavalry and infantry who outﬂanked and inﬁladed the Indians untill they retreated, the whole line of the Indians then retired below the Fort imagining their loss to be much greater than it since appears to have been having seen several of their principal Chiefs fall; the greatest loss they have sustained is in their leaders, they halted that night at Swan Creek about six miles below & were not pursued, there were never more than 400 Indians engaged during the whole day. and these stood the shock of a great part of their army for upwards of two hours and lost in the whole but 19 men among whom are to be much lamented 8 principal Chiefs of the Wyandots 8: two of the Ottawas besides two more wounded. lSee appendix.

Some Letters passed between Major Campbell Commanding Fort Miamis 8: General Wayne after the Action, and on the 22nd the American Army quitted the position they had taken within a mile of the Fort, and retreated the same way they came, but whether on account of the want of Provisions or of an order from Philadelphia cannot he certainly known.

Mr. Denny1 had very lately under his command at Port Le Boeuf one hundred and ﬁfty men, with the Surveyor General of Pennsylvania Mr. Elliott.1 He had also one twelve Pounder. two nine’s or six‘s. one or two four's and a few Swivels. these People were enlarging 8: strengthening that Fortress and it should appear to be their intention to press on to Presque Isle; 'Venango or Fort Franklin is fortifying with six or eight pieces of Cannon & is garrisoned with one hundred men, a large block house or store house is building in the center of that place. Mr Rosencrantz has been heard to say, but since contra- dicts it that Morgan, The riﬂe General was raising six or seven thou- sand Kentuckians to join Mr Wayne—This man has further mentioned that “the Insurrection of Brackenridge"1 &c “at Pittsburg and its En- virons” has at present subsided but he is perfectly ignorant whether it is owing to the probability of the repeal of the Exercise Laws in the ensu- ing Session of Congress or to other more forcible motives, such as the Federal Party in that Quarter being stronger and more numerous than the Insurgents, or a compromise with the General Government, the annihilation of which, was the primary object in their minds. It is humbly presumed. that the intention of the present Commis- sioner, Mr Pickering to the Indians of the Six Nations is principally to persuade them to dispose of their Lands. probably that part of their country along the margin of Lake Erie. comprehending Presqu: Isle and its vicinity at the same time to hold forth to them. in the plausi- ble and cajoling language of the Friendship urbanity 8: moderation of the I'nited States, the plea of a treaty to adjust a proper boundary Line. and with a view of settling the business more effectually they are solicited to attend a Council in the Genesee. which if acceded to, would possibly leave them at the mercy of Land Jobbers and tend to alienate their affections from His Majesty’s Subjects; it will be much to be lamented, therefore. if the craft & subtelty of the Emissaries of the I'nited States to the Indians should dissuade them from their res- olution of receiving all missions at their own Council ﬁre at Buff-aloe 18cc appendix.

I expect to have an opportunifv of writing to Colo. McKee tomorrow by a gentleman going to Detroit. when I shall inform him of his Lordships intentions mentioned in your letter of the 22d Instant. There has been only one purchase made of Land from the Indians since my arrival in Canada which was made by Colo. McKee in the year 1790 by Instructions from the Superintendant General who had directions from His Lordship for it. Major Murray who commanded at Detroit at the time was present. and saw the goods delivered to the Indians for payment. I have not seen the Kings Instructions with respect to purchasing Land from the Indians in Canada. The great Purchase at Fort Stanwix in 1768 was made by Sir “'ill-
Page 377

KNOX 377 iam Johnson then Superintendant and sole agent for Indian Affairs and that by a particular order from the Secretary of State. all other purchases were made agreeable to His Majesty's order in council which was that they should be made publickly in presence of the Superin- tendant the Governor of the Province or some of the Council. I was at Johnson Hall in 1772 when several Large Tracts of land was pur- chased from the Mohawks Oneidas &c. and this was done before Sir William Johnson Gov”. Tryon and Two of His Majesty‘s Council for the province of New York. It appears to me that it would be very proper when Purchases of Lands are made in this Country from the Indians. that the Superin- tendant or the Principal oﬂicer of the Indian Department of the Dis- trict where the land is situated should be the person to treat with the Indians, and the deeds of sale and payment should be executed and made in presence of the Commander and some other officers of His Majesty’s Troops, as well as some principal persons in the Civil Line, and it might be very proper to give one to the Indians who would then always know what they had sold & it might prevent Jealousies & uneasiness hereafter.

CAPT. BRANT TO COL. PICKERING 381 CAPT. JOSEPH BRANT TO COL. PICKERING (Cony.) Fon'r Ems 6th November 1794 Sm I was favored with your letter dated at Canachaqui the 25th Ult. at this Post. in answer to which I beg leave to inform you. that upon my return from the I‘pper Country I was informed by Mr. Johnston1 that you had sent a message by runners to the Chiefs at Buﬂ'aloe Creek. and amongst others you mentioned words to this effect— Brothers—I will now read you a letter from C-aptu Brant. he says “that he is very sorry he could not attend the treaty at Canacharqui. as he is obliged to go to the Westward, which he is sorry for, that he will soon be back, and will remain only one night at home. when he will immediately proceed to the Council at Canacharqui.2 and does not_ doubt but he will be there in time to recommend that the 6 Nations. should attend this Council as it will be for their g .” This part of your speech was' delivered to Mr. Johnston in public by the formers Brother a principal Seneca Chief, and which I suppose to be a mis- representation being totally different. from the contents of my letter. it must therefore have the Fabrication of unprincipled Indians who will say anything, or go anywhere for the sake of Pecuniary gratiﬁcation. We referred to the President of the United States thro_Genl. Chapin a boundary between the Western Indians and your people upon which it was probable that peace would have been established and you know that the Six Nations did everything in their power to establish it. We have received no answer to that proposal. and of course supposed it declined in consequence of which the Six Nations concluded not to remove again from home, but were ready to listen to any business the United States might have with them at their own Council ﬁre this was fully explained to General Chapin in Council at Buﬂ'aloe Creek.3 I am fully satisﬁed that no representation of my letter came from you. and am inclined to think it came from unprincipled Indians, who regardless of the welfare of their Country. attended only to their own Interest. and all the troubles that have existed since the peace of 1788 is owing to the transactions of the States with people of this description. _ ' Since the meeting of Canacharqui has taken place I hope it will be to the satisfaction .of both parties. which on our part implies a con- currence of our Boundary Line. upon which in my opinion a peace may take place. that will be agreable to the confederate Indians. lSee appendix. 2(‘anandla ua Konondargua.

382 INDIAN AFFAIRS I am exceeding sorry to lmrn from your letter. that Mr. Johnston was looked upon as an intruder, and British Spy.1 It was at the request of the Six Nations that he proceeded to Canadarqui, in order to attend. a Council ﬁre that you had kindled for them at that place. they had a right to have any person present they pleased, and it is proper it should be so, that no misrepresentation of their proceedings should take place, If they are free and independant they may do this. I am much obliged to you for your oﬂ'er of sending me the extempore speech you made to the Six Nations in the presence of Mr. Johnston, I well know the unhappy situation of the Indians, and the white people have guided them, as best suited their Interest. At the return of the Chiefs from Canadarqui a Council will of course take place, at which I wish General Chapin to be present, if his health will permit, if he cannot come this fall, I shall expect him in the Winter.

George Huifnogle an American born, Serjeant in the 3d U. S. Regt- says that he with ﬁve others were taken Prisoners on the 2nd Instant about 14 Miles on this side Fort Deﬁance, that they got a pass to go a foraging, but their real design was to desert to the British Fort.— He says there are 150 men in Fort Deﬁance that the Garrison have been very sickly and several have died, but are now getting better, that when he left the Fort they had only 12 days ﬂour and one days beef, but that a convoy was soon expected.~that General Wayne has gone to Fort Greenville from the Miamis Towns. He says the General concealed as much as possible the number of killed and wounded in the engagement on the 20h August but from the accounts which he has had by a communication with other non-commissioned ofﬁcers. he is inclined to think there were upwards of 200 or probably 300 killed &: wounded and they buried 30 of the wounded who died on the road between the Battle ground and Fort Deﬁance. He further says, he does not certainly know whether the Military have got home, but he believes so, their time for which they engaged being expired. Edward Connolly from the County of Tyrone, Ireland, Corporal in- the same Regt, being also examined. agrees in his relation with Serjeant Huﬂ’nogle. [signed] ‘A. life KEE [O 248. p 22] S. I.

JOSEPH CHEW TO THOMAS A. COFFIN 383 JOSEPH CIIEW TO THOMAS ASTON COFFIN MOXTREAL 17th Nov. 1794 MY DEAR SiR The Depredation Committed on the Indian Presents by a Person entrusted at the time with them and who the Superintendant General always appeared to have a very good opinion of is truely astonishing. Some time after Lord Dorchester left this Town I heard a report that a Mr. Gamlieur had sold goods at Michilimackinac which differed from such articles as the Merch‘s imported and were more like Indian goods. I made every inquiry I could. but came at nothing more than that Mr. Todd had purchased some of these goods. and on his coming down I might have the matter assertained. I went to La Chine and mentioned the matter to Mr. Goddard who said he was conﬁdent they could not have been taken from the Store at La Chine as the keys were never out of his possession and he had constantly examined the stores—he then told me there had been a Report of a Dark Lanthorn being carried about in La Chine some little time before which had occasioned him to look more particularly into the stores—that it was almost impossible any attempt could be made on the store without being heard by the person he generally employed about the store who lived in a house Sir John had permitted him to build on the Bank opposite. and very near to the store—I went into the stores with Mr. Goddard and saw the goods put up in such order that it appeared to me a Bale could not have been removed without its being noticed— as there was a report about this Time of a Parcel of Furl-s attempted to be smuggled. I concluded that to be the cause of the Dark Lanthorn Business. on Mr. John Forsyths arrival who had been at Mackinac I inquired of him but could obtain no further information Respecting the Goods sold there, and not hearing fl'Olll' Captain Doer or Mr. La Mothe on the Subject—I saw no Method of ﬁnding the Truth of the Matter before Mr. Todds arrival—having heard it hinted that some Indian goods had been sold in Town—and Mr. McCord Calling on me on Wednesday last to see if I was sending any letters to La Chine I informed him of what I have now related to you on Mr. Goddard’s coming to Town. he assured me he was perfectly Conﬁdent no such articles could be taken from the Stores at La Chine —I have not been able to go out—from every Information I have Mr. Connolly must have taken & secreted these goods and perhaps many others at the Time the Indian Goods were Transporting from the Cross to La Chine which he had the sole direction of, Mr. Goddard being

I look upon to be Consequence of the Large Number of Indians that are to be in the neighborhood of Detroit next Spring and Summer. I have therefore inclosed a Requisition for such additional Presents for 1795 as will enable the store keeper General to Compleat Colonel McKee-s Requisition and Leave a few of those articles for the other posts if l‘qulIl'Pd—I thought it Best to send the Requisition that his

Captain Johnny‘ principal Chief of the Shawinoes came to me last night and informed me that La Plant1 a Frenchman of the river aux rasine had come to him and the other Chiefs a few days ago, that he held a council with them and told them, that the old men would well recollect the time when the English threw their French Father on his Back and they would remember also that their french father told them at that time that he would soon rise again on his feet. He then told the Chiefs, the time for their French Father to shew himself was drawing very near and he would support and protect them. That the English had no title to the name of their father, that he and the Americans were as one man and neither of them friends to the Indi- ans and that they must look to the river aux Rasine for their only Father the French would treat them all his Children. and that instead of looking on the English as their Father they were the Natural Enemies of both the French & Indians.

Mr. Clark‘s Huron friend is returned. the occasion of his long absence was in order to see young Leans (Zeans)2 to learn what has passed been “'ayne & the Sandusky ambassadors. They left Sandusky with the war song 8: came to Lean’s Camp 8: told his wife they were going to war. When the young man arrived some time after & found his comrades had passed he followed 8: over- took them a little way from his Father‘s 8: ﬁnding they had no pro- visions took them back with them to the Camp and there they disclosed the secret. Young Leans said he would accompany them be the con- sequence what it would: They arrived at Greenville when an express was sent to Wayne who arrived there with the Express 16 days afterwards. He told them he was glad to see them come upon the business they did & at the same time pitied their condition in listening always to the English who wished to have them in the same situation as themselves unable to help themselves. They told them always to be strong and defend their country, & furnished them with ammunition, but they might be convinced from their late conduct that they had neither the power nor inclination to help them. He had only employed the.force of his little ﬁnger which they were not able to resist 8; dared not to ﬁre at him altho’ under the walls of their Fort. He advised them to return to the side of the Sciota, where they would be safe. as his young men meant to range the plains this winter & destroy every- thing that came in their way. That he heard the Shawanese Delawares Miamis & Col° McKee were camp’d below the English Fort on the banks of the River & would pay them a visit this winter with some of his young men accompanied by 7000 Militia & 500 Chickasaws, if they resisted their ruin would be the consequence if they ﬂed before him he would turn off & build. a house at Sandusky among his good friends the Wyandots, then return to Greenville. The Fort the English had built at the Rapids he'would pass on the opposite side & build a Fort at Turkey Point where he would be joined by a party of Americans from Fort Pitt, by the way of Cayhaga. He would next proceed to Brown’s Town when he would summon the English to leave his houses & lands 8: pass to the other side which they would quickly do & then he would walk quietly in & take possession of his own.

[M 15, p 6] JOSEPH CHEW TO THOMAS ASTON COF'FIN MONTNEAL 5h January 1795 DEAR Sm, The Instructions you have drawn respecting the mode of purchasing Land. in future from Indian Nations are in my opinion very proper. if you see ﬁt what I have mentioned of Interpreters may be included in Article No. 1. I am well convinced that the remark I made with regard to not snﬂ‘ering Rum to be introduced at the time of holding councils with Indians, and particularly when Purchases of Land are to be made from them ought by every means to be inforced and may be added at the end of the 1st, or introduced into the 3d Article of the Instructions as you think best. Sir William Johnson who perfectly understood Indians and when they paid him friendly visits was very free and merry with them; at the time he held Councils or had business with them was particularly ceremonious and Transacted matters with much solemnity, at those times he was allowed to understand the Mohawk Language better than any other person and acquainted with that of several other Nations he always employed Interpreters, who sometimes he was obliged to correct and I have heard some of them were' under oath on particular occas- ions to interpret according to the best of their knowledge, at the Treaty at Fort Stanwix in 1768 all the Councils were opened and held with great ceremony and solemnity, and as much so as was possible when the Treaty was closed the Deed signed and the Territory ceeded paid for; nothing can be more proper than delivering the Indians a copy of the Deed and a Plan of the Lands purchased from them, this

Things of this sort was always lodged by the Six Nations at the Onondaga Castle. ‘ ' I have also been surprised that a stop has not been put to Rum being introduced among Indians when met in Councils or Business of Importance, in consequence of Representations made by Colonel McKee. When Indians were expected at Johnson Hall to meet Sir William in Councils, Notiﬁcations were put up at the most principal places on the road they were to come forbidding the sale of Rum to them and a Constable was sent to the Traders 8: Inn keepers in the Vicinity of the Hall giving them the like notice, and if any person underhandedly disobeyed the order they were sure of being prosecuted. The same orders were given at Fort Stanwix where a number of Traders had assembled, and so exactly were they complied with that for upwards of four weeks while the great body of the Indians were waiting the arrival of the Shawanese, Delawares & Senecas of Ohio, I dont recol- lect seeing but one Chief in liquor and that was in consequence of some gentlemen treating him. at which Sir William was not well pleased. The purchase of Lands from the Indians in this country since the Peace with America must have been strangely made, and very improperly managed or the Deeds and Boundary Lines would be to be found in the Superintendant General’s oﬂice. the only Boundary that is in his ofﬁce to be depended upon is for the purchase made by Colonel McKee in May 1790, indeed there is a kind of a Boundary Line of a tract purchased from the Mississagoes in May 1784 by order of General Haldimand. Major Littlehales wrote to me the 5th of November 1793, desiring me to give Mr. Aitkin a Deputy Surveyor information of the different purchases made from the Indians between the Lakes Ontario and Huron. I let him know that neither deeds or documents were in the Superintendant General’s ofﬁce, he has again wrote me on the 24h of Oct. last by order of Gov. Simcoe for all records and documents relat- ing to purchases made from Indians in the vicinity of York to which

396 INDIAN AFFAIRS They wish now to have our advice and opinion on the matter, I shall therefore in a few days send off messengers to Swan Creek, where they now are, desiring them to stand ﬁrm to their agreement made last fall, and not permit their young men, or any other nation to have any intercourse, or in any manner to confer with General Wayne, or any of his People and if they stick to their agreement they may expect me early in the Spring but if they do not abide by what was determined on last fall, they will be lost, but if they hold out untill Spring I am conﬁdent they may get better terms of accommoda- tion than it is now possible for them to do. A number of deserters from Wayne’s Army have come in this winter from the different Posts where they were stationed, they all agree in their information, which is, that they are much distressed for pro visions, and that if attacked a small body would oblige them to quit their posts. It is a pity Colonel McKee should have lost his influence with the Indians, or that he ever interfered in their councils.

I will go to the Store with one of the Gentlemen who made the Survey and get the Articles for them—At the same time considering all matters I humbly submit it to his Lord- ship—whether it is not best that these people be clouthed handsomely and sent away satisﬁed— Inclosed you have a Requisition for ﬁfty Rations of Provisions for them in Town and up to Kingston for ﬁve Gallons of rum to take up with them. It appears to me to be very bad policy in them to be desirous of settling their Land there is not the least doubt of the Americans taking every advantage of their Complaints to withdraw them from the British Interest, as the Return of these Indians will be the ﬁrst opportunity I shall inclose letters for Colonel McKee to the Store Keeper at Niagara to be delivered to him on his arrival there and if his Lordship has any commands the Conveyance will be very safe—— I am Dear Sir Your most obedient Humble Servant JOSEPH CHEW Joseph is a Chief a Fine young fellow and much thought of at the Grand River &c Tho“ Aston Coffin Esq.

DEAR Sm, I am extremely sorry that the Person I sent with my Letter on Thursday did not immediately go to the Post Oﬁice with it as he was ordered, by which means it was too late for the Post. I therefore got the Favour of Major Bunbury1 to take it. I have examined the Records &c of the Indian Department left by the Supr Intendant Gen]. a schedule of which I now enclose, one for most of them was sent in December 1792, at that time I wrote you I apprehended the missing Records Were among Colo.

Johnson’s Transactions with the Indians are torn defaced 8: damaged so that it is difﬁcult to ﬁnd anything particular from them, there isnot any mention of the Treaty which 0010. Butler says was made with the Mohawks for delivering up Persons commit- ting murder. I was at Johnson Hall when the Six Nations delivered up the Two Senecas concerned in murdering four Frenchmen on Lake, Ontario who were committed to goal, I therefore examined what papers I could ﬁnd about that time, but have not been able to come at what passed between the Indians & Sir William Johnson on the occasion. from the extracts of two copys from two Letters from him to the Earl of Dartmouth His Lordship will see this was the ﬁrst instance of the Six Nations ever being brought to deliver up any of their People to be tried by our Laws, and I think if there had been any particular Treaty for it Sir William would have mentioned it to the Earl. It therefore appears probable that Colonel Butler may be mistaken with respect to a Treaty being made particularly with the Mohawks for that purpose, when others of the Six Nations were constantly coming amongst the Inhabitants. I was the Person who went with the order to relieve the two Sene- cas which was sooner than was intended on account of one Cre-ssup2 on the Frontier of Virginia murdering sundry of the Six Nations who 1See appendlx. zCapt.

A great number of them was already gone off, to General Wayne’s Camp before we left that Place, the rest of the Tribes were also preparing to follow them without any order. All appears by the movements of the Indians, that Wayne will have every thing done in his own way. it is certain that country is going to disso- lution, there is a swarm of Land Jobbers at Detroit I mean the Kings Subjects buying lands from the Lake Indians, giving them rum which made those Indians continually drunk and no doing any business with them, many of those Land Jobbers1 are now gone with the Indians to Wayne with their Deeds tO get them conﬁrmed by him, and a great many other old Deeds besides the new ones are also sent as I was told. The ﬁrst people at Detroit are the Chief Traders in this Land Affair, Sir you see the poor Indians must lose their Country at all Events—Colonel England cannot interfere with the people of Detroit. Colonel McKee is gone from there so the Indians are entirely left to themselves.

414 INDIAN AFFAIRS Lands relinquished by the United States in the 411 Article, it is now expressly declared that the meaning of that Relinquishment is this. The Indian Tribes who have a right to those Lands are quietly to enjoy them; hunting planting & dwelling thereon so long as they please without any molestation from the United States. But when these Tribes or any of them shall be disposed to sell their lands or any part of them, they are to be sold only to the United States, and untill such sale the United States will protect all the said Indian Tribes in the quiet enjoyment of their lands against all citizens of the United States 8: against all other white persons, who intrude upon the same. And the said Indian Tribes again acknowledge themselves to be under the protection of the said United States and no other power whatever. Article 611. If any citizen of the United States or any other white person or persons shall presume to settle upon the Lands now relin- quished by the United States, such citizen or other person shall be out of the protection of the United States 8: the Indian Tribe on whose Land the settlement may be made may drive off the settler or punish him in such manner as they shall think ﬁt, and because such settlements, made without the consent of the United States will be injurious to them as well as to the Indians the United States shall i be at liberty to break them up & remove 8: punish the settlers as they shall think proper 8: so effect that protection of the Indian Lands herein before stipulated. Article 7h. The said Tribes of Indians parties to this Treaty shall be at liberty to hunt within the territory & Lands which they have} now ceded to the United States without hindrance or molestation, so long as they demean themselves peaceably 8: offer no injury to'the people of the United States. . ‘ Article 8h. Trade shall be opened with the said Indian Tribes 8: they do hereby respectively engage to afford protection to such persons with their property as shall be duly licensed to reside among them, for the purpose of Trade & to their agents & servants, but no person shall be permitted to reside at any of their Towns or hunting camps who is not furnished with a license for that purpose under the hand and seal of the superintendent of that department North west of the Ohio or such other Person as the President of the United States shall authorize to grant such licenses to the end that the said Indians may not be imposed on in their Trade. And if any licensed Trader shall abuse his privilege by unfair dealing upon complaint and proof thereof, his license shall be taken from him & and he shall be further pun- ished according to the Laws of the United States. And if any person

And to prevent impositions by forged Licence the said Indians shall at least once a year give information to the superintendant or his dep- uties of the names of the Traders residing among them. Article 9h. Lest the ﬁrm piece and friendship now established should be interrupted by the misconduct of individuals, the United States and the said Indian Tribes agree that for injuries done by indi- viduals on either side, no private revenge or retaliation shall take place. but instead thereof complaint shall be made by the party injured to the other by the said Indian Tribes or any of them to the President of the United States or the Superintendent by him appointed; and by the superintendant or other person appointed by the President, to the principal chiefs of the said Indian Tribes or of the Tribe to which the offender belongs and such prudent measures shall then be pursued as shall be necessary to preserve the said peace & friendship unbroken untill the legislature (or great council) of the United States shall make other equitable provision in the case to the satisfaction of both parties. ‘ Should any Indian Tribes meditate a war against the United States or either of them and the same shall come to the knowledge of the beforementioned tribes or either of them, they do hereby engage to give immediate notice thereof to the General or officer, commanding the Troops of the United States at the nearest Post. And should any Tribe with hostile intentions against the United States or either of them attempt to pass thro’ their country, they will endeavor to prevent the same, and in like manner give information of such attempt to the General or officer commanding as soon as possible that all causes of mistrust & suspicion may be avoided between them and -the United States. In like manner the United States shall give notice to the said Indian Tribes of any harm that may be meditated against them or any of them that shall come to their knowledge. 7And do all in their power to hinder and prevent the same, that the friendship between them may be uninterrupted. Article 10h.

DEAR Sm, I have your Letter of Monday last- the goods for the Indians at Gaspé will be sent from Lachine and a Requisition shall be forwarded for them- having wrote to Colo. Mc Kee the 22nd Ulto that if I did not hear from him in the course of eight days I would make a Requi- sition for 35,000 Rations of Provisions and 1,000 Galls of Rum as an additional supply for Indians at Swan Creek and Detroit, I therefore believed it best to send it, and if not approved it may be cancelled. Inclosed you have a- Report of the Survey of the Presents p. the Sarah, I am sorry to ﬁnd by it that some of the articles are reported to be overcharged; with respect to the gun worms being improper Mr. Turner is not to blame, they were particularly ordered by the direction of Mr. Goddard, I have always been of opinion that it was bad Policy to give Indians Guns at 208. Price they never were acceptable to them and soon became useless and were always dangerous, but such were ordered. The powder is exceedingly good and astonishingly cheaper than that ordered by the merchants. Inclosed you have an estimate of some Packing Boxes which the Storekeeper General wrote me were wanted and desired I would imme- diately get them made & sent to Lachine. I therefore ventured to comply with his request before the Estimate could be sent for His Lordship’s decision, great part of them are sent to the Store and are made on the most moderate Terms.

Mr. Molloy the Conductor who went with the goods for the Upper Posts, returned some days ago and brought‘ the inclosed Letter and Report of Survey on the goods for Detroit and Michilimackinac which not being comformable to the general orders, I think it requisite, it should be transmitted for my Lord Dorchester’s Information, at the same time I beg leave to observe, that in a private Letter to me, Colonel England says, That as a Survey conformable to the general orders could not immediately take place on account of the smallness of the store and the short time that the conductor could remain at

The Bateau with the goods wanted at Kingston and the Posts in its vicinity. as also those wanted to compleat the Requisitions for Niagara, Detroit and Michilimack’inac will leave this under the care of Mr. Molloy in a few days.

The only article, in the Indian Stores, which would answer for cloathing for the new Corps. is blue Strouds. and tho’ that is one of the most necasary for Indians, there is a much smaller proportion of it now in Store than of almost any other kind of goods. before the arrival of the Sarah there did not remain a single piece of it, by that vessel I received one hundred and sixty pieces of which eighty six pieces are now packed up for the Requisition for the Indians in the vicinity of Kingston and to compleat the deﬁciencies which arose last Spring on the Requisitions for Niagara, Detroit 8: Michilimakinac. so that there is now left only seventy four pieces, of which some part will be wanted for whatever Presents His Lordship may think proper to give this fall to the Indians of lower Canada. and if the Requisition from the upper Country are as great next year as they have been in the present one they cannot be compleated till the arrival of the goods from England: If the Jackets and overalls for the new corps are made of cloth of the same colour, what I imagine the ofﬁcers would wish to have if it can be got. I reckon they will require nearly four yards a man, which. taking them at 500 strong. will amount to 2000 yards. equal to about 95 pieces of Strouds. I will go to Montreal to morrow or Satur-
Page 422
422 INDIAN AFFAIRS day morning and inform myself what kind and quality of cloth, likely to answer the purpose, is to be got there and by next post inform you of the result of my enquiries, I think there is little probability, from the nature of the Trade at Quebec, that a sufﬁcient quantity of cloath of the same color could be got there, but as Blue Stroud is a great article in the indian Trade, perhaps a suﬂicient quantity of them could be got at Montreal; If we ﬁnd it necessary to make any enquiry at Quebec on the subject Mr. Tod or Mr. Blackwood are the persons either most likely to supply the cloath or to inform you where it can be got. If great coats are wanted and there is any difﬁculty in getting proper cloath for them, there is in store here a great quantity of Blankets (of which I have subjoined a note) and part of them might be spared, but, in that case, it would be necessary to make a new Requisition from home. as I endeavoured in making out the last Requisition to proportion the articles in such a manner that when they are received the goods in Store may be in such proportion that there may not be a deﬁciency of one article and a surplus of another. I proposed to have sent off all the goods wanted for the Upper Posts tomorrow, but on making application to Mr. Clarke for Batteaux I ﬁnd that he cannot furnish them till next Monday. I am Dear Sir Your most obedient. humble Servant JOHN Lars Note of the Quantity of Blankets which will remain in store after compleating all the Requisitions. 1 point 1314 pairs 11/ do 1187 do. 2 do 1288 do. 21/ do. 1551 do. 3 do. 858 do.

I concluded that the accounts for the two last were to be in the abstract and included in the memorial to be sent to Head Quarters for the amount of disbursements for the present quarter. I apprehend from the statement sent from here amounting to £299- 28 you ordered that sum into the Deputy Paymaster General’s hands. by the statement now inclosed it appears to me that a requisition should have been made for the articles amounting to £220 108 6d they being in the Indian Store: and that an estimate should have been made for those charges amounting to £78 113 6d which sum should have been .placed in the depty. Paymaster General’s Hands, and I think we are here in fault for putting the matter in one account our stationery not being arrived and the Posts of Niagara & Detroit being destitute of that article I have thought it best to have two small Boxes made and send them all that can be spared from this ofﬁce, for which I inclose a small estimate. In the Requisition dated the 28h March last and approved the 2d April 10 pieces of Russia Sheeting was required for making Oil Cloths; the Estimate of the same date was for making Twenty when these were ﬁnished it was found that there was a sufﬁciency of cloth remain- ing to make ten more as there was but few in the Store these were ordered to be made a part of which Colo. McKee had as will appear by the Requisitions for the Post of Detroit dated the 28h July last. I have therefore enclosed an Estimate for making these ten. I have no answer to my Letter to the Priest of St. Regis respecting the disputes of the Indians of that Village from the inclosed Letter sent by Lorimier a day or two ago to Mr Lees it appears the Black fellow Louis is the instigator 8: promoter of this business.

Why the Deputy Agent employed a person not in the Depart- ment I know not—it appears to me very improper that the Storekeeper should be ordered from the Store to go with the presents for the Indians to the Grand River and Buﬂ’aloe Creek—suppose the goods last sent up arrive in his absence who is to receive them—his Business is to deliver from the Store all articles required by the agent approved by the Commanding ofﬁcer and to attend and look after the Store.

DR Sm, On the 1511 Inst I forwarded the Pay Lists for the Department at this Post, which Mr. Crooks1 handed me, your Letter of the 2611 August, inclosing the forms of receipts, and extract of Mr Cofﬁn’s Letter dated Quebec 13h Angst. did not get to hand time enough to have the receipts altered as the Interpreters receipt from Oswego, and those of Mr. Mount & Myers at the Grand River were already ﬁlled up, and signed, I shall take particular care to make them in future agreeable to the form sent. I shewed your letter of the 18h October (wherein you say it is expected that all accounts of the Indian Deptt at this post are to be made out and stated by me) to Colo. Butler, and told him that no doubt he would be made acquainted therewith. I had returned from the Head of the Lake before the receipt of your Letter in which you inform me that His Excellency the Com- mander in Chief disapproves of my leaving the Post to attend the delivery of presents, it was Colonel Butler’s particular desire that I would go with the Presents, I mentioned once to Major Littlehales that I did not conceive it to be a duty altogether incumbent on me, but as Mr. Sheehan did not go I thought it would be necessary for some person to attend besides Colo. Butler, as his age and inﬁrm state of health would in some degree prevent his being so constant with the Boats and goods as to prevent their being stolen which was the case last year. I am happy to have it in my power to say that no accident of this kind has taken place this year. Enclosed you have a return of the Indians settled at the Grand River to whom presents were given at the Head of the Lake also a copy of a Letter from Maj. Littlehales to Colo. Butler, with Colo. Butler’s answer thereto, these Letters will shew what passed with the Missasaga. Nation of Indians respecting the purchase of a spot of land for Capt. Brant, as they are an unsettled people I could not get their numbers exactly, they are computed to be about six hundred men, women and children. When at the Head of the Lake Capt. Brant’s son Isaac got drunk and abused his father in the most shameful manner, making use of the most opprobious epithets that can be imagined, and on Capt. Brant’s going into the room where he was made a stroke at him with a knife, which Capt. Brant warded off with his hand. at the same time 1See ﬂppendi x.

430 INDIAN AFFAIRS His Excellency Gov" Simcoe has gone to York for the Winter, pre- vious to his departure he left directions with the commanding oﬁicer to request Colonel Butler to make a requisition on the Store at this Post for what presents he might think it necessary to be. given to Indians resorting to that place for the winter. I mention this as Col. Butler told me that the Stores demanded for this Post were not intended to be given to the Indians who frequent York, they being principally Indians who come from the,Rice Lake who receive their supply of clothing from Kingston, Col. Butler however desired me to make out a requisition for sundry articles. which I have put on the Caldwell now ready to sail for York, and by Major Littlehales’ direc~ tions, consigned them through the Issuing Commissary (Ad. McGill Q Rangers) to His Excellency Governor Simcoe. The ofﬁcer the day certiﬁed their issue from the store as usual, and I have wrote Mr Mc- Gill enclosing Invoices to be Receipted by him and returned to me, I do not know that any further account is given by him to shew that they are actually made use of for the Indians or not. Doctor Kerr told me he intended writing to you by this opportunity respecting the method, by which the ofﬁcers of the department at this Post receive their pay and if it could not with propriety be altered, at present it is uncertain which way the payment will be made the quarter before last Colonel Butler gave each Person a Draft on Mess" Lester1 & Co Merchants Quebec for the amount of their pay out of which 2% p. c. was deducted for agency which was paid to Mass" Les- ter 8: Co or Mr. Crooks Merchant here which I cannot say the last Quarter Colo. Butler gave no separate Drafts. said Mr Crooks would pay the money on demand, I did not obtain mine (due the 24h Sept. last) tho’ I called several times ’til the 27h Inst. I beg leave to observe that if each person could be permitted to draw on the Actg. Pay Master General Joshua W'inslow Esq. (after the Pay lists and receipts were made out and sent forward) for the amount of his own pay it would Im conﬁdent be satisfactory to the whole. the unnecessary expense of agency would be avoided and the time and method of obtain- ing their pay made easy and certain, as each can at all times be pro- cured for a draft. having heard several in the department say they were kept out of their pay a long time. and then pressed to take goods or Paper Money for it, induced me to mention what I have on the subject, you are best capable of Judging of the propriety of my 1Robert Lester was a merchant In Quebec toward the end of the Revolution.

The goods for the other Requisitions are all packed up and marked and may be sent off at any time, His Lordship thinks proper, after the Rivers are taken. As I was anxious to get all the Accounts of the Department as clearly stated as possible, to go down to Quebec, and the roads between this and Montreal are excessively bad, I have not been there for about a month past, and have not heard of any purchase made of Gunpowder, but I eXpect to leave this in three or four days and will get all the information I can on that head on my way down. I apprehend that any powder there has been bought is only on speculation, for the pur- pose of smuggling into the state of Vermont for present use as I heard in the fall by some gentlemen who had come from New York, that Powder was as high as a dollar a pound there, besides there is at all times a pretty high duty, I think, on Powder imported into the Amer- ican States.

Brant & his son, with a return of the Indians settled at the Grand River who have received Presents a copy of which you have herewith and copies of Major Littlehales’ and Colonel Butler’s Letters concerning a purchase of a Tract of Land from the Messaga Indians for Capt Brant. I likewise send you a copy of his the 'storekeeper‘s Letter of the 29h Novl‘. giving the Information of his having received the goods sent for that post by Mr. Gordon the Conductor, who had been obliged to store the Presents for Detroit and Michilimackinac at Fort Erie, there being no vessel to take them to . Detroit, he also mentions a Requisition being made by Direction of His Excellency Governor Simcoe for presents to be sent to York for Indians resorting to that place during the winter, and of their being sent to the Governor through Mr. McGill the Commissary. Colonel Butler the Agent when the Governor directed him to make this requisition ought to have informed him, that the presents sent to Niagara were not intended for Indians that might visit York—and if they are intended for those of the Rice Lake—they have been very amply provided for already. In this Letter the Storekeeper states the uncertain mode by which the Department are paid at the Post of Niagara and their being sub- ject to a discount of 2% p cent for agency. upon Enquiry I found
Page 433
JOSEPH CHE'W TO THOMAS A. COFFIN 433 that Messl'B Lester & Coy. (Company) very properly charge a half per cent ——-that no more is deducted from those of the Department at Detroit, whether Colonel Butler had the 2 p cent extra deducted when Mr. Shee- han made out the accounts or if it has only been done since he has employed Mr. Crooks, I am not able to say—but it appears to me that now there is a clerk to do the business of the Department no deduc- ' tion should be made except what is paid at Quebec—this and the other matters mentioned I humbly submit to His Lordship.

My DEAR Fsrnxn, I take the Liberty of acquainting you of the uneasiness of the Indians Inhabiting the Grand River (the cause of which you know) on that subject we made a speech last October at this Place to Lieut Governor Simcoe containing a full explanation of the whole affair in return to which His Excellency assured us that he would immediately forward it to His Lordship. and that we might expect an answer as soon as it might be possible. Since the communication has been stopped we have enquired of His Excellency concerning the answer we expected from His Lordship, to which he gave us no satisfactory return, this is the reason that induces us now to send to you, that you may acquaint His Lordship with our uneasiness at not having an answer to our speech as we expected—the copy of which I suppose your son sent you. we therefore sincerely wish that it may Please His Lordship to give us a full & explicit answer on the affair, as it has long been hanging too heavy on our minds. My D r Friend I understood that you expected to hear from me last summer at my Return from the “'estward, which I confess as a Friend you had a right to do, but the distrmsed condition of the poor Indians in general especially those in that 'quarter, prevented be from saying anything as it seemed entirely at an end and gone too far ever to think of repairing the damage and I may well say that this is the second time the poor Indians have been left in the lurch & I cannot avoid lamenting that they were prevented at a time when they had it in their power to make an Honorable S; Advantageous Peace, that would not only have been Interesting to all Indian Nations but also to the English which you very well know. My dear Friend I was formerly in full courage to use my utmost endeavours to promote the Welfare of the Indians in general & English Inhabitants; but it is now entirely at an end, and I am entirely dis- couraged from attempting to say any thing further on Public matters. We have an Agent at Niagara who seems discontented & every thing seems a Difﬁculty to him. Mr. Johnston the Interpreter for the Five Nations is stationed at Butfaloe Creek—and for our part when we have any Business to do at Niagara we have no one at all to assist us in- it. On the other hand as I foretold you those of the Five Nations living on the other side of the River seem perfectly contented with the situ-

Brant, informing him that I had received such Papers and if he hould conclude to let the Indians go down to Montreal, would be obliged to him to let them call here before their departure, he has been so good as to let them comply with my request; Joseph who was down last winter is one who goes, he is much employed by Capt Brant, is a faithful trusty & sober young man. I hope you may be ,able to provide them with Cloathing from the General Store, and pro visions for their return that they may not suffer from cold or hunger. This is all they expect. _ I am happy to have it in my power to acquaint you that the Indian Stores for Detroit which Mr. Gordon the Conductor stored at Fort Erie and which I wrote could not be forwarded that season where soon after sent forward, and have been received at Detroit as Mr. Selby writes me.

I am extremely glad to ﬁnd the Presents Gordon the Conductor stored at Fort Erie were sent forward and had arrived at Detroit. You will observe from Capt. Brant’s Letter that he is much dissatisﬁed at not getting an answer from His Excellency Governor Simcoe to the speech he made on behalf of the Indians on Grand River to him in Oct. last, I am sorry to ﬁnd from Joseph the Express who is a very good & intelligent young man that the Indians on the Grand River appear very uneasy on account of their situation. I am afraid they have not been so much 'attended to as those are who live at Butfaloe Creek I know the Indians were always favorites of Colonel Butlers. but it is a mystery to me that Johnson the Interpreter should be stationed at that village which Capt Brant says is the case. The Michilimackinac Requisition mentioned by Colonel McKee is not made out in the regular Alphabetical order it ought. I shall transpose it 8: put the prices to the articles & forward it very soon. there appears some sort of fatality attending that post no receipts have been sent with the Pay Lists mentioned by Colonel McKee.

A principal Seneca Chief called Fish Carrier died lately upon which acct. the indians at Buffaloe Creek 8: the Grand river assembled to go through the customary ceremony of condolence 8: to create a new chief, Mr. Johnston, Interpreter came down with a number of the Chiefs to get a few articles for the purpose of covering the grave and wiping their Eyes, which has generally been granted to them on such occa- sions, he wanted some wampum which the store could not furnish, there is some requested for this year’s supply which I hope may be sent as Capt. Brant & other chiefs have often asked for it. He is now here with a party of Chiefs from the Grand River, his Business, I believe is principally to confer with His Excellency the Lt. Governor about the Deed for their Land, the Vessel being ordered to sail imme diater prevents my giving you any further information on that head at present. Capt Brant hints as much, that if something is not done more satisfactory than has been hitherto, he will not mention the matter again, but take it wholly into their own hands, and do what they think best with the Land, the result of_ his present conference with the Lieut. Governor I shall acquaint you with as soon after it comes to my knowledge as an opportunity may offer. I have this moment been informed that Colonel Butler died about 9 o’clock last evening, I therefore lose no time in making you acquainted therewith, for the information Of His Excellency the Com- mander in Chief and I wish to be informed if his pay will be con- tinued till the end of this Quarter or if a separate Pay-list should be made only to the time of his discease, also if it will be requisite to send the Pay-lists &c to Detroit to be counter-signed by the Dy.

CAPT. JOSEPH BRANT TO JOSEPH CHEW 447 undiminished, and we hope it may continue Between your people and ours as long as there is one left. NEWARK 16 May 1796 Signed in Behalf of the Six Nations by Jos. Bnax'r [o 249, p 188] CAPT. JOSEPH BRANT TO JOSEPH CHEW NIAGARA 17h May 1796 DEAR. Sm, I arrived here a few days ago accompanied by some of the principal men from the Grand River to settle some business respecting those Lands we wish to Lease we are happy to ﬁnd that Lord Dorchester is favourable to our wishes. His Excellency Governor Simcoe does not seem to oppose us since that, but there appears to be a party working under hand with the Senecas living on the other side to oppose our Leasing any Lands, my opinion is that the annual income of those Leased Lands should go only to those living on the Grand River or such of the Six Nations as may come there to settle, for the Senecas on the other side never allow us any share of what they receive from the Americans. Last Spring I met the Six Nations in Council at Buifaloe Creek, when the Senecas declared that as long as they remained on the American Side, that they could not interfere in the Lands at the Grand River and left the Leasing or management of it for the interest of those living there entirely to us, and that they would manage those Lands on the American side themselves. If any obstruction happens to the Leasing our Lands at this time it must Proceed entirely from a Party of the Governors working with the Senecas. If I ﬁnd that we cannot compleat this agreeable to our wishes, I mean to go down to see His Lordship before he goes Home, as I mean to persevere in this business. After a long and severe illness Col. Butler is departed this life, the particulars of our meeting on that occasion you will be informed of by your son. I am rather apprehensive our friends the English will let this appointment die away but I assure you nothing could hurt the Indians, so much as that should it happen they would look upon themselves and their Interest to be neglected in this Quarter at least, this is my sincere opinion and I will be much obliged to you if you

DEAR Sm, Your Letter of the 19th is received 8; by the ﬁrst opportunity will send Mr. McDoneli a copy of His Lordships Speech made_to the Indians of Lower Canada in August 1794, and request him to explain it to the Chiefs of St. Regis which I apprehend Mr. Lorimier has not fully done. I have not seen him for some time, have heard he was unwell, three days ago one of the most principal Chiefs with ﬁve others came to town from St. Regis to know what Mr. Lorimier was directed to say to them, I got Simon Clarke, the occasional Inter- preter to Inform them, and before they returned they appeared well satisﬁed, they complained much of Mr. Lorimier and said they had not called on him on their way down neither would they when they Returned—said they had an entire dependence on His Lordships2 Goodness, I believed it best not to say a word about his leaving the Country—but discouraged their going to Quebec and desired them to let their Chiefs know that it was not only improper but quite unneces- sary as they might be quite sure if Sir John Johnson did not arrive whenever their affairs required it the Commander in Chief would meet them, the frequent visits of those Indians has obliged me to employ Simon Clarke while they are in Town—at whose house they stay, and who has a great deal of trouble with them. Yesterday I received Letters from Detroit of the 14th of April I enclose a copy of Col. McKee’s Letter & an Extract of Mr. Selby’s, with a small requisition for some Articles for the New Settlement of Chenail Ecarte—at the same time I received a.

I have not had an opportunity of sending a copy of His Lordship‘s Speech to the Indians of Lower Canada, but shall do it the day after tomorrow, to Mr. McDonell of St. Regis. I humbly submit whether it will not be best to desire him to state to the Indians he recommended, the rule adopted for not giving Partial Presents from the Indian Stores, that when the next annual present is delivered he shall be considered, and say nothing of His Lordship’s intended Goodness in giving him money, as this will not be a secret and there has been. so many com~ plaints & applications of late from that Village, that I apprehend if money is given to this Indian it will be the means of renewing them. and probably occasion those who may think they have equal claims with this man, to take it into their heads to proceed to Quebec to 57 -

DEAR Sm, On Monday last four Indians from St. Francois came to town to represent that the Inhabitants were taking possession of their Lands. They wanted to have a Letter wrote to His Excellency Lord Dor- chester informing him of this and of their hopes that his Lordship would put a stop to such proceedings, also that they wanted a Grant of more Land, which Letter they would carry themselves to His Lordship, I let them know I could not take upon me to give such a ‘ Letter, and advised them to return home and wait untill Sir John Johnson arrived, who was dayly expected, who would enquire particu- larly into this Affair and make a Report to His Lordship, who they might be assured would have Justice done them, they had some pro- visions and I hope have taken my advice. The day before yesterday I received Letters from the Storekeeper at Niagara inclosing a Letter from Capt. Brant a copy of which I now forward also a‘ Copy of the Ceremony of a Condolence of the Six Nations, for the Death of the Late Lt. Col. Butler, with Governor Simcoe‘s Speech to them on the occasion.

Page 451
COL. Mc KEE TO LORD DORCHESTER 45] \ I also send an estimate of the Cost of Gun Cases & packing Boxes which Mr. Lees directed might be immediately made and sent to Lachine which has been done, before there was time to transmit the Estimate for approbation, the old gun cases were in so shattered a state, there was no such thing as cutting them down to the size wanted.. I have consulted Mr. Clarke and ﬁnd one Conductor cannot possibly take charge of all the Boats required to take up the Indian Presents even if they were to leave Lachine on the same day, which he says they cannot, it will therefore be necessary to have another Conductor and from what Mr. Clarke tells me it is probable the Boats may go in two divisions. I have therefore wrote to Mr. Lees and if he approves of it, have proposed that the goods to pay the Chippewas for the Land purchased from them, the whole of the presents for the post of Michili- mackinac and as many of those for Detroit as will Load the Boats of the ﬁrst division be sent in those Boats—that the whole of the presents for Niagara & the remainder of those for Detroit go with the second Division. and I think if the Conductor who goes with them sees those for Detroit shipt at Fort Erie or safely delivered to the Asst. Commy there he may return, which will be the means of the expence not being more than half what it will be if he goes to Detroit, and I apprehend the goods will be equally safe. It will cost a dollar pr. Day & Ration for an Additional Conductor. - I am Dear Sir Your most obedient humble Servant JOSEPH CHEW Thos. Aston Coﬂin Esqr. [C 249, p 173] COL.

MY Loan I receive the highest satisfaction in Your Lordships approbation of my conduct expressed in your Letter of the 6th April and I trust I shall never be deprived of so estimable a Treasure. Agreeably to your Lordships desire I have inclosed a. Plan for the future Government of the Indian Department which comprehends all that appears to me requisite at present for carrying on the duties thereof in the Upper Posts; and also a correct list of the names of such as your Lordship hasypermitted me to recommend as Superin-

I have presumed to recommend William Claus Esq. to your Lord- ship as Superintendant of Niagara, in the room of the late Colonel Butler. Mr. Claus and his family having been for many years on the most friendly footing with the Six Nations. it is presumed he would "be able to carry on the service with ease to himself, and satisfaction ito the Indians. but as it is uncertain whether Mr. Claus will accept this appointment, I shall desire Mr. Chew to make the inquiry for your ‘ Lordships' information. But having been informed that the Buperintendant General will in all probability be in the Country, before your Lordship can receive this Letter it would give me great satisfaction to have the Superintending of the Six Nations ﬁlled up 'by the recommendation of Sir John Johnson, an account of the friend- ship and attachment which has so long existed between his family and the Six Nations. With regard to the name which I olTer to Your Lordship’s consid- eration for the Superintendent-y of Michilimackinac, be assured my Lord, it cost me many struggles before I could prevail on myself to recommend my son; but on mature reflection, and with an anxious regard for the King’s as well as the Indian Interest, and possessed of the fullest conﬁdence in his integrity, Loyalty and abilities, to do ample justice to both I feel myself justiﬁed in the measure independent of my consanguinity, and I anxiously hope Your Lordship will not dis- approve of my recommendation on that account. It was always my intention to promote him in the Line of the Army but it appears to me that he will be of more material service to the Crown in this Department than in any other. from his habitual inter- course and general knowledge of the persons, Characters and Languages of most of the Indian Nations. I have the honor to be &c [signed] A. MCKEE. Proposed plan for the future government of the Indian Department, humbly submitted to His Excellency Lord Dorchester—Commander in Chief &c. &c. &c.

COL. MC KEE TO LORD DORCHESTER 453 these Garrisons. The different Tribes cannot be brought to the latter post at any ﬁxed period in order to distribute the presents all at once, as at Niagara and Kingston; the distances from whence they come, and from each other renders it impossible; and it appears impolitical also, even could it be accomplished, to have so many Indians collected at the Post, where irregularities might possibly be encouraged by those who are shortly to become their neighbours, In all events the Indians coming in small parties. individually receive more attention and respect, and prevents these Jealousies, which they are very apt to entertain on a supposition that one Band or one Nation have either received more presents 01' been better treated than another. That altho‘ a Superintendant for that Post appears necessary, it does not seem requisite that Store House should be erected, nor that the Superintendant should remain there after the Indians have received their supplies, I beg leave therefore to submit to Your Lordships consid- eration that the Supt. for Michilimackinac shall remain in the winter as an assistant to the Superintendant. of the Post of Detroit (which the business of this Post requires) and that he shall on the opening of navigation every year repair to Michilinrackinac to meet the Indians and distribute the supplies agreeably to the general orders, and in the fall of the year return to this Post. The Storekeeper Interpreter and Smith should remain at the Post. constantly and some few articles left for Indians accidentally visiting in winter. That as your Lordship will no doubt see the necessity of directing Houses or Barracks for the ofﬁcers of the Department at this Post. it being almost impossible for them to exist without such aid, a small place detached from the dwelling of the Storekeeper or even under the same roof, for depositing the goods. untill given away, will answer every purpose of a Storehouse. the securities given by- the Storekeepers being a sufﬁcient indemniﬁcation for any irregularities that may be attempted. - It is submitted also to your Lordship‘s consideration that the Super- intendant at Niagara should so arrange the periods of distribution at that Post and at Kingston as to allow him to attend at both places when the Indians are collected to receive their annual supplies, leaving a few articles in the charge of the Storekeeper as at Mir-hilimackinac for accidental demands during the winter. . That the Superintendants of the respective Posts will be required annually to send to the Deputy Superintendant General a report of the state of all the Stores in charge of the Storekeepers by Survey, and of the temper disposition and apparent views or designs of all the Tribes in their districts respectively, and also all the public speeches

And that on all occasions the ofﬁcers commanding Posts shall use their utmost diligence to preserve and promote friendship between the Troops and Indians and to restrain the former from the commission of any act that may tend to interrupt that harmony so necessary for the tranquility of both and the safety of the Kings Posts.

With respect to the Commission that Major Doyle has issued appointing a Chief to the Chippawas at Sault St. Marys—I think I can venture to say it is the ﬁrst of the kind I am sure no man can have His Majestys Service more at heart than the Major has and that he did this with the best intentions but it surely will have a bad effect with Regard to the Inﬂuence the ofﬁcers of the Department ought to have with Indians.

SIR, ' I now inclose you the report of the Survey on the Indian Presents imported in the Earl of lifarchmont—Colonel McIntosh being ill Capt. Humphrey attended in his room. I also inclose you the copy of a Letter from the Storekeeper and Clerk of the Indian Department at Michilimackinac, brought by a Chief and a party of Ottawas from that I’ost,_who it appears that the Caughinawagas to shew their consequence have sent for to hold a general council with the Seven Nations of Canada, and which this Chief says they say is of the greatest consequence to Indians in gen- eral; this Party consists of seven men 8: six women and I fear will be a troublesome as well as an expensive visit; I have given them an order for four days Provision from the 27h being ﬁfty two Rations and one Gallon of Rum. Considering the situation of the Western Indians at present and the importance of the Ottawa Nation who on all their visits to this place have had particular attention paid to them, at the end of this four days I must give them another order before that is expended I hope to know the Commander in Chief’s Pleasure. This Chief makes strong profession of attachment to His Majesty 8: his Subjects, and says he must wait untill the Seven Nations of Canada ale assembled and that he will truly report the Business for which this Council is called for the Information of His Excellency the Commander in Chief. Early this morning eleven Indians among whom are two or three Chiefs arrived from Lake Nippissing, about half waybetween this and Michilimackinac, came to Town to represent their situation and in a long Speech, set forth their dish-esses, as well as attachment to the King 8: the English, and prayed they might be furnished with some Firelocks, Powder, and Shot to enable them to hunt for their support and that they might receive some necessary cloathing for themselves & families, get provisions while they remained here and carry them home, at the end of the Speech the Chief delivered a Beaver Blanket—The ﬁrst thing of the kind that I have seen done since I have been in Canada. It has been necessary to provide some place for them Mr. Lamothe the Interpreter has let them have a part of his house for which he should be considered—very ample provisions was made for the Ottawas who met Lord Dorchester in this Town in the year 1790.

Please to acquaint Mr. Craigie . that he may inform Mr. Clarke; The Indians of Lake Nippissing had no Presents last year—I now humbly submit to His Excellency the Commander in Chief that in order to save Provisions and get them _away it might not be well to supply them with some guns Powder Shott and necessary Cloathing and immediately transmit the requisition for the Articles if His Excellency approves of this I will consult Mr. Lees & they shall only have a moderate supply according to the number of their village.

INDIAN SPEECHES TO GEN. PRESCOTT 465 thro’ the interferance of some ill disposed white men, We beg of you Father to reﬂect that we are the true Native Inhabitants of this Country and that God had placed us ﬁrst on these Lands, it is there that our ancestors to preserve peace had resolved only to make use of one Dish and one Platter and to act all together (this parable signiﬁes that there was no Limits for the indian Hunting, that all the Country should be free.) When the King of France set foot on our ground he did not conquer us he came as a Father who wishes to protect his Children. We communicated to him the parable of the Dish and the Spoon, he approved of it and encouraged us to continue in our way of acting. He did not tell us children I want to share in your Dish and have the best Bit in it. When our Father the King of England drove away the King of France, we were so earnest in nothing as communi- cating to him this Parable, He did more than the King of France for he had the goodness to pop up the Dish telling us that he did not wish that we should make use of Knives to eat our Meal, least they should hurt us as a proof of it we preserve his word (parolle) He did not tell us that he wished to eat with us, being accustomed to a ditferent kind of Food. You have often told and repeated to us that you, wished to make no distinction. in the Number of your Children, wherefore we beg of you in the name of all the nations to take back your word (parolle) and to give us another that may gladden the Hearts of your Indian Children from the rising to the setting of the Sun, don’t think father that we speak alone, we speak on behalf of all the Indian Nations, and we would be to blame if we did not make our Just remonstrance to preserve the Life of our Brothers, for if you persist in your opinion they must die of Hunger. Father, You are not ignorant that the great council Fire of all the Indian Nations is kept in our village of the Falls of St Louis, or Caughna- waga. We therefore beg of you to give us an answer that we may make it known as soon as possible to our Brethren the Ottawas (Courte Oreilles) who are now on the point of setting out for Michilimackinac, we beseech you to believe us your true children who will not cease to pray to the Supreme being to preserve you in good Health for your Indian children.

The second Explanation asked me is this. “'hy the indians of Sault St Louis assume the stile and Title of the ﬁrst Indians, I answer that the ﬁrst indians known on the discovery of Canada were the Algon- quins 8: Nippissings who were long considered as the ﬁrst among the Indians and afterwards as the Indians of Sault St Louis were more in the proximity of government, the French for that reason judged it necessary with the Approbation of all the indian Nations to establish a great Council Fire at Sault St Louis and since that time they have been considered as such by all the indian Subjects to the King of France. There is also a Great Council Fire at Michilimackinac the Courte Oreilles, ()ttawas are the Chiefs of it, but they look on the Indians of the Sault St Louis as their elder Brothers. there is another Fire among the Hurons of Detroit. for all the indians of the Southern Parts, which also is subject to the Great Fire of the Sault St Louis. _ I see no Nation that does not consider the Village of the Sault St Louis as the ﬁrst, except the Six Nations, having never been subject to the French is the Reason why they were not associated to this Fire.

The original Deed with the Commission of Lieut Governor Simcoe’s appointing two gentlemen to be present at the execu- tion thereof will be forwarded to you by the ﬁrst safe opportunity to be recorded in the Superintendant General’s ofﬁce agreeable to the General Order. It is not possible for me to express my Surprise and concern when informed of Mr Duggan’s return together with the Smith of the Department from Michilimackinac with what goods remained in Store there by order of Major Doyle—The Indian Department has uniformly been considered as permanently ﬁxed there as the Garrison. and inseparable from it, unless by an authority equal in power to that which constituted it; ﬁnding therefore that no orders had been sent to bring down the Ofﬁcers of the Department I give orders for their immediate return with the goods brought away 8: also with a part of the goods for that station for the present which lately arrived at this Post.
Page 474
474 INDIAN AFFAIRS I did not think it advisable to order the whole, apprehensive, that from the want of Store Houses at the present Garrison the Kings Property might Perish. The Superintendant of that District did not receive his Commission until some time after the sailing of the Vessel, so that his duty must necessarily be conﬁned to this station until the opening of the naviga- tion next Spring, and it appears very important that the Presents for the North Western District should be here as early as possible; I rely therefore on your concerting measures with the Storekeeper general, in conformity to the Military Secretary’s Letter to you of the 18h July last that they may be forwarded as soon as Batteaux can Navigate the River to Kingston, and of your obtaining an order to have them for- warded from Post to Post as expeditiously as Possible. It having however been reported here that only one of the King’s Vessels usually navigating at this Post is in future to be in com- mission, and as she will most probably be constantly employed in the Transport from Fort Erie, at least for the ﬁrst two months of the Spring, by which His Majesty’s Interest may be greatly endangered in the North Western District, I beg leave humbly to propose to His Excellency the Commander in Chief the propriety of sending to St. Joseph’s Island the Maria, the new vessel of the Indian Dept. being sufﬁciently large to carry all the Presents for that Post, but it will at the same time be nece§ary that a proper master and a sufﬁcient number of seamen should be appointed by His Excellency to take charge of her and as Lieut Guthrie of the Marine Dept. is an extremely capable and deserving young man and is one of the number reported here to be sent on Half Pay at the reduction, I submit to His Excellency the appointment of that oﬁilcer to take charge of the Maria for the purpose above mentioned. A Letter from Ensign Brown Commanding at St. Josephs is just come to hand I inclose it for His Excellency’s Information Mr. Brown I see is unacquainted with the general orders respecting Presents and Purchases but Mr. Duggan will be able to explain both on his arrival, lest however any of the goods intended for Presents should be so mis- applied and appropriated in the 'manner of a compensation for the Island I shall endeavor to send an express canoe to forbid it. In my last letter from Mr. Cofﬁn of the 7h July he is directed by Lord Dorchester to write as follows-“With regard to Isle aux Cari- “boux or any other of stations newly occupied, measures should be “taken to purchase the same without delay.” His Excellency will be. pleased to permit me to state that conform-

I went up myself -with three constables the 1711 Instant & had three Houses searched & found three frocks for children & a small remnant of striped cotton in one of the Houses, 41/2 yards stroud 8: 2 yards of ribbon in another House, and a pattern of a shirt for a man in the third House, which I had brought down with the three men and who acknowledged their buying these things from the Soldiers of the Queen‘s Rangers, the expences of this business will come very high for constables &c. &c. &c.

SIR, I had the honor of your Letter under date the 6th Current, respect- ing the Requisitions for Indian presents, and Sir John Johnson1 having arrived here yesterday morning Mr. Lees & I explained to him this Forenoon the principles on which these Requisitions were made out; we made up a particular state of the articles issued in the present year and taking that as a Basis, on which we concluded that similar requi- sitions, would be made for the following years, after deducting from the amount of the Articles contained in that State the amount of such of them as are now in store of which we had an exact Inventory before us, we made out the additional Requisition to compleat the supplies for the year 1797 in such manner that there might with that addition be a supply in store for the issues of the next Year. In making up the Requisition for the year 1798 we proceeded on the same principle, of taking the issues of this year as a Basis, and deducting some triﬂing articles, of which there is in store a sufﬁciency for the supply of two years, we framed it in such a manner as we thought would leave in store such a supply for that year as might be sent off compleat early in the Spring of the year, without being under the necessity of making a second Shipment, after the arrival of the goods from England, as has been the case for last and the present years, and which must also be the case in the ensuing one. if the goods do not come out very early next Spring; The particular States being at Lachine and only made out in rough I cannot at present send copies of them but I have made out a State shewing in money the amount of the Requisitions of this year, for His Excellency’s Information; After shewing to Sir I 3%“ John Johnson recelved a leave of absence in the summer of 1792 and returned in l .

(La Tranche) being £1333 13s 411 for which a Requisition was sent by Lord Dorchester last winter. but at the same time he thought that in case these goods do not arrive this fall, it might be advisable to remind His Majesty’s Ministers of this Requisition. It may appear extraordinary to His Excellency that the Requisitions made this year are so much greater than those of last year, on which I must beg leave to observe, that when these Requisitions were made, there remained in Store a suﬂicient quantity of many valuable articles, to compleat the supplies of this year and part of the next, as you will observe by com- paring the Requisition for the year 1797 , with that of the year 1798, and further that the Requisitions were made very early in the month of August, before any orders had been given for presents for the Indians of Lower Canada; by which means a quantity of goods amounting to about £800, which it had been calculated would remain in store, were issued and the general consumption was increased, with- out any additional Requisition being made on that account. If His Excellency should approve of taking off the amount of the Purchase of Lands from Requisition for the year 1798, a Requisition shall be prepared on that ground ready to be transmitted without loss of time.

And the Striped Cotten that got rotten I believe got wet after dis- charging at the new British Post entrance of Detroit River, as there was very heavy rain with great wind two or three days, before the goods could be stored, by which the oiled clothes were blown off, and before the goods could be covered again, it was visible that some goods in the Bales got wet, but the contents being exposed to dry, and the cotton being in cases, it could not be known whether it got wet or not, till three weeks after, when the cases that contained the cotton. with other packages were opened in order to survey, and count the contents when it was found the striped cotton was rotton also. And it is not likely that goods in cases could get rotton by lying on the Ballast, but Bales did, and it is not common or proper, to lay Bales on Ballast without some donage.

I wish to state the motives that induced me to suspect that the Queen’s Rangers at the Post of (‘Jhippawa1 have robbed the Indian Presents in July last while forwarding them from Chippawa to Fort Erie & a paper signed by Mr. Thomas Cummings, Commissary at Chippawa will shew the cause I had to suspect certain inhabitants mentioned to have been concerned with the Rangers, either in assisting them, concealing or purchasing the goods stolen vizt. Lieut Cowel of the Queen’s Rangers commanding at Chippawa, informed me on my return from Detroit that he had Just cause to suspect the Rangers of robbing the Indian Presents as some time after forwarding them to Fort Erie his men were drinking & carousing & had plenty of money at a time when they could not get money Justly, not being paid olf. And having made a. search in their quarters but found nothing, as it was found since that the Inhabitants were in Co. with them & con- cealed the goods and after the search several of his men deserted being apprehensive it would be discovered that they robbed the Indian Presents & took Lieut Cowel’s Boat & oars with them across the river 1Fort Chippewa was situated opposite the second Little Fort Niagara at the mouth of the Welland river.

I now inclose you the copy of a letter from Colonel McKaa and of one from Ensign Brown that oﬁ‘icer I should think never saw the Regulations of the 26h December 1794 with respect to making Pur- chases'of Land from Indians. Col. McKee having wrote so fully upon that subject and other matters of the Indian Department for His Excellency the Commander in Chief’s information, I have only to let you know that the Requisition for articles to enable him to make the purchases he mentions shall be sent by the next Post. ' I have also received an Extract of a letter from the Storekeeper and clerk of the Department at Newark respecting the Interpreters for that District, from what I hear of Mr. Constance who is an Indian Trader of some consequence at Matchedosh I can scarcely believe he will remove from thence to act as an Interpreter at Newark, where by the orders and regulations he cannot Directly or in Directly carry on any Trade whatever. I likewise inclose the Establishment for the Department and for the Temporary and Pension List for the year 1797 to commence the 25h Dec. 1796 and am 810 JOSEPH CHEW Capt. James Green M. S.

Page 484
484 INDIAN AFFAIRS the Commander in Chief respecting these deﬁciencies and Damage, I have also inclosed a number of certiﬁcates and afﬁdavits which were delivered to me by James Molloy, the Conductor, on his arrival at this place and as the afﬁdavits are very voluminous I have made an Extract of those parts of them which appear to me the most material. From the certiﬁcates it appears that part of the goods were stowed in a very careless manner on board of the Mohawk, Capt. Bouchette in the passage from Kingston to Queenston landing near Niagara, tho’ it does not appear that they received any material Injury more than the outside wrappers being very much rotted; the Conductor being of opinion that the damage reported on a Bale of Ozenbrigs and two cases of Stript Cotton happened at Malden, where the Goods lay three weeks exposed to the weather, previous to their being surveyed, only covered with oil Oloaths which, he says, were frequently blown off in hard squalls of wind 8: rain. The Conductor alledges that the deﬁciencies arise from,the packages having been opened by soldiers of the Queen’s Rangers who transported them in Boats from Chippawa to Fort Erie, and from the different copies of Afﬁdavits made before the magistrates at Newark, certiﬁed by them to be authentic, there is strong reason to conclude that the allegation is well founded, it appearing by these aﬂidavits soon after the goods had passed there, many articles of the same kind as those which are missing, were offered for sale by the soldiers, and by the atfadavit of Joseph Prevost it appears that Mc Clauchlin.1 a Soldier in the Rangers, confessed that a Quantity of the goods had been thrown into the River, on an alarm given to the Thieves. by a search made about the same time for some Scyths, which had been stolen from Mr. Cum- mings; It appears to me that the Conductor is blameable in two points, ﬁrst, in not applying for a. Survey to ascertain the damage sustained on board the Mohawk, It being an article of his Instructions, given to Him in writing, that in case of any accident happening to the stores under his charge, he shall apply for a survey at the ﬁrst Post at which he arrives to ascertain, by what means or by whose fault, such accident happened, secondly in not observing at Fort Erie that the Packages had been opened; To the ﬁrst of the Charges he says that on his arrival at Queenston Landing about nine miles from Newark, He found there only a Serjeants party, he wished to have a survey which was communicated by them to the ofﬁcer commanding at Newark, who sent a message that he would have nothing with the business, and that having been directed to make all possible dispatch & seeing the goods

He even says that, on his Return to Chippawa from Detroit He was informed that some of them had embarked in the Boats proper Tools for open- ing Boxes, but of this he produces no proof. The Conductor appears to have been very' active on his return to Chippawa in endeavouring to discover either the persons concerned in plundering these Stores or , receiving them afterwards and has left the original Aﬂ’adavits and Examinations in the hands of Mr White1 the Attorney General of Upper Canada, but very much doubt if, on these proofs any of the Parties can be brought to Justice by a prosecution at Civil Law three of the principals, Johnson, Jobson & Butler appear to have deserted but Corporal Thompson who oﬂ’ered to John Garner for salela piece of stript cotton containing 33 yards for twelve dollars which is 17s 6d less than the ﬁrst cost of it in London, and McClaughlin, who con- fessed that part of the goods had been thrown into the River, appear to be still in the Regiment, and I beg leave to suggest that if they were brought to a Court Martial it is not improbable that further discoveries might be made— It is stated in the Report of Survey that the boxes in which deﬁc- lJohn W-‘hlte was killed in a duel Jan. 4. 1800 by Small, clerk of Council.

I have been particular in stating fully everything relating to the Transaction as I conceive it necessary to take every possible precaution to check either mistakes or Embezlements of this kind in the begin- ning, and have to request His Excellency’s orders with respect to any further steps he may think it necessary to be. taken by me.

As His Excellency the Commander in Chief has thought proper to direct that the buildings erected by Individuals within the Line of Defence of this Garrison and within the reservations made by govern- ment for Military 8: other purposes shall on consideration be suffered to remain. It is the positive order 8: injunction of Captain William Mayne of the Queens Rangers Commandant of the Garrison that the owners of the aforesaid property do without delay remove there buildings from within the line of Defence & Reservation made by government to the nearest vacant land in the vicinity of this Garrison. The Tract of Land hitherto called Colonel. McKees bounded on the north by that claimed by Colonel Caldwell and on the south by Captain Elliotts claim comes under this description. The Commandant therefore appropriates the same for the present establishment of the Buildings in question & trusts His Majesty’s sub- jects in this concern will seasonably attend to it previously to any dis- agreeable measures being adopted to enforce the same.

492 I INDIAN AFFAIRS REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL J. SEWELL TO GEN. ROBERT PRESCOTT To His Excellency Robert Prescott Esquire, Lieutenant Governor & Commander in Chief in and over the Province of Lower Canada &c. &c. &c. May it please your Excellency. Your commands having been signiﬁed to me by Capt. Green, I have perused the several aﬁidavits and Papers accompanying the Letter of Mr. Lees of the 17h of October last, from which it appears that in the passage of the Indian goods (intended for Detroit & for the purchase of Indian Lands) from Niagara to Detroit in July last, various articles to the amount of £92, 13, 5 Sterling have been lost & there .is every reason to believe that the Packages were opened & the articles missing stolen by soldiers of the Queen’s Rangers, who transported them in Boats from Chippawa to Fort Erie. From the Deposition of Joseph Prevost, Benjamin Sessions and William Leonard the Theft appears to have been committed by Serjt. Walker,1 with McLaughlin, Jobson, Butler 8: Johnson Privates in the Rangers, and the Afﬁdavit of John Garner impeaches Corporal Thomp- son. But these depositions altho’ they induce the strongest suspicions, do not absolutely prove the felony, which if the River from Fort Erie to Chippawa is a navigable River is a capital offence by 24 Geo. 2Q. C. 45. . The Defect of the Evidence is, that it is merely presumption and not accompanied by any circumstances which ﬁx guilt upon the Sol- diers. It is true goods are proved to have been in the possession of the Soldiers suspected & that they are similar to those which were in the Packages but there is no Evidence & it will be difﬁcult perhaps impossible to prove, that the very goods seen in their possession were ever in the Packages. And if even that is established the naked fact without the assistance of other circumstances, would not probably con- vict them, for admitting that they did not prove that the property came fairly into their Possession it might still be presumed that they were Receivers only; 8: this Presumption would in all probability be admitted, because in capital cases it is an invariable Rule to admit all Prcsumptions in favour of Life in their fullest Latitude, and there is a strong Reason for such admission in this instance. It is not perhaps possible to ascertain precisely at what place the Theft was committed. It might have happened before their arrival at the Chippawa or after they left Fort Erie, for it does not appear that there was any survey of the goods from the time they left Lachine, until their arrival at Detroit. 10f. supra, p. 507. =I‘r0bably 24 Geo.

RETURN OF PROVISIONS ISSUED TO INDIANS 493 John Garner, Mary Garner, William Bryant, John Fanning, John Petit and William Shaver all appear deeply concerned in the business. They are certainly accessories after the fact, but the misfortune is that until the Principals are convicted, the accessories cannot be brought to trial. In this Situation, the object is to gain such further Testimony as will be necessary to convict the Principal Offenders, and consequently the accessories who as objects for Punishment are of much greater importance than the Principals. If there were no Receivers .of Stolen Goods there would be no Thieves. I do not however see, that any step can be taken by Your Excellency, which will be of material ser- vice towards a discovery, unless Mr. Lees Suggestion of a General Court Martial should be adopted. How far this may be expedient is a question. I am of opinion that a Regimental Court Martial or a Court of Inquiry upon all the soldiers who were in the boats is admissable, and both appear to me to promise the same advantages, which Mr. Lees expects from a General Court Martial. The Original Afﬁdavits, upon which this report is founded, are in the hands of the Attorney General of Upper Canada where the offence was committed and he has, I doubt not taken the necessary steps for elucidating the Transactions, to which they relate, and of bringing the Oﬁenders to Justice as far as has been practicable.

ALEXANDER MC KER TO SIR JOHN JOHNSON PETITE Corn Sm 20th January 1797. By the last vessel which arrived at this place in the Fall, I had the great satisfaction to be informed of your safe arrival in Lower Canada, together with Lady Johnson and family 8: I hope you will allow me to present you and them my most sincere congratulations. Mr. Chew has no doubt fully informed you of the state of Indian Affairs, and of the Changes which have taken place in the Department during your absence: As far as both have depended upon me, my utmost abilities have been exerted for the Kings Interest and the general beneﬁt of the service. During a long period of diﬂiculties among the Indian Tribes and pending the evacuation of the Posts and those parts of the Indian Country from whence their sustenance was generally drawn, the humanity & Policy of Great Britain through the Commander in Chief Lord Dorchester directed their distresses to be relieved as well in Pro- visions as in an extra allowance of Cloathing, until] they shall be enabled to plant for their own support: The Lands at Chenail Ecarte (in addition immediately to those adjoining and which were purchased in 1790) were directed to be purchased for that purpose, and it is not doubted but we shall have a large settlement there early in the Spring; already there is a considerable Village of Ottawas at that place and there is every reason to suppose that the Shawanese, Mingoes, Nan— tickokes, Munsies & C-hippawas will ﬁx themselves there also and com- mence their Cornﬁelds as soon as the weather will permit. The Situation of this Settlement as the principal place of residence for the Indians is singularly advantageous, as they can carry on their business without interruption with all the Nations & Tribes with whom they have any knowledge, from Lower Canada to the borders of all the Lakes and the Mississippi. 63

The original motive for employing these Interpreters was to prevent their accepting greater offers which were made to them by the Agents of the United States at a time when the situation of this Country wore a very unfavourableaspect, the steadi- ness with which they have adhered to their duty has shown they were not employed in vain, and I have the highest satisfaction in informing you that the Indians generally are as strongly attached to His Majesty’s Government and Interest as at any former period. Three of these temporary Interpreters are at present stationed at Chenaii Ecarte for the purpose of taking care of 8: Issuing Provisions to such indians as have lately come to settle within the Line of the King’s Territory, two others one for the same purpose stationed among the Bands. who are now living in the vicinity of the mouth of Detroit River waiting for the return of Spring to go to Chenail Ecarte also and Mr Pettier (Peltier) the other having declined serving any longer is struck 011’ on the 24h Decl' agreeable to an authority given me by Lord Dorchester for that purpose. he has since entered into the service of the United States in the same capacity. It would have afforded me sincere pleasure had it been in my power consistently with my duty to have reduced the expences of the Estab lishment long ago by striking ed the whole of these extra Interpreters But you Sir, who so well know the nature of Indians & how liable we are to be imposed on by them, must see the necesity of the strictest vigilance in the Issuing of Provisions, to prevent imposition independ- antly therefore of their duty as Interpreters they have constantly been employed in this necessary service and while these unfortunate people are allowed a subsistence there must of necessity be people employed for the purpose of Issuing it, and I am persuaded others could not be got for the same price. As to the addition to the permanent Establishment I persuade myself your own just observations as to the necessity and propriety thereof has stamped it with your entire approbation. By this opportunity I forward to you the original Deeds of the two late purchases together with the Commission of the Lieut. Governor appointing two gentlemen to be present at the execution thereof agree- ably to General Orders, Duplicates have also been forwarded to the Administrator of this Province and Triplicates delivered to the indians who executed the Deeds.

' The arrival of the Superintendant General having been notiﬁed to me by the same conveyance which brought your Letters, I presume the future recommendations & other arrangements of the Dept. will now be made by him—it is however proper to correct a mistaken rumour with regard to J. B. Constance as an interpreter, this man was nomi- nated for the Messasagues from the strong recommendation of Lieut Governor Simcoe & appointed by Lord Dorchester 7h July 1796 together with Johnston 8; Price for the 6 Nations. I believe there is no doubt that Constance is one of the best Chip pawa. and Messasague Interpreters in this Country, he is besides a man of great inﬂuence from a long residence among them & it was con- sidered proper by His Lordship there should be one for that Nation at Niagara. With regard to the consumption of provisions by the Indians, it is necessary I should state for His Excellency’s information that Ninety six thousand Rations & 3500 Bushels of Corn, have been the usual allowance of the Post for Indians Passing & repassing And that an extraordinary allowance has been promised & granted ever since they were driven from their Country.

During the last winter while the Western Indians remained at Swan Creek, great numbers of them were sent out to hunt in order to save provisions & none were sudered to be issued but to such as were really upon the spot, so that we were enabled by that means to make a very considerable saving. His Excellency will be pleased also to observe that 35,813 Rations 8: 30291/2 Bushels of Corn which are included in the Return of the Deputy Commissary were sent to Chenail Ecarte where the Treaty for the late purchases was to be held, and that from the lateness of the arrival of the goods, for the Payment of the Lands upwards of one thousand Indians were kept together 8: fed from the latter end of June until the 8h Sept. His Excellency may be assured your Letter of the 17th October much surprised me, but the Deputy Commissary’s return of the issues for Indians during the year ending the 24h Decr. last will I trust shew that some mistake must have been made in the Return you alluded to. The Requisition for extra Provisions which I had the honor to make of the 18h August last by the direction of Lord Dorchester, is intended for the support of the Indians who are to form the Settlement at Chenail E’Carte until their Corn Fields are ﬁt for use. I beg of you also to inform His Excellency that such steps have been pursued to Husband the small quantity of provisions in Store, as it is hoped will satisfy the Indians who are informed of the scarcity until a fresh supply can be sent up.

I received your letter of the 29h September 1796 after I had sent to Head Quarters the Estimate of the workmanship & Materials necessary for constructing a Guard House at this post this letter induced me to discontinue the building of the Guard House untill I should learn from Head Quarters that the Estimate was approved of and a scite appropriated for its position within the line of defence. At the same time I erected a temporary Guard House adjacent to the proposed Wharf calculated to starve the pur- pose of a Batteaux Guard. Herewith is the Estimate of Expence 8: Materials required for this service, and for a log building as additional Quarters for my oﬁicers which I was induced to put up the Block House intended for ofﬁcers Quarters not being begun.

MAJOR SHAXK TO CAPT. JAMES GREEN 507 MAJOR DAVID suaxx TO CAPT. JAMES GREEN FORT Greener: SIR 25h Feby 1797. I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letters dated the 18h November and 15th December last, together with Mr. Sewell’s opinion relative to the theft of Indian Goods supposed to be stolen by Soldiers of the Queen’s Rangers employed in transpOrting them to Detroit River; until I received your letters I had no idea of the extent of the spoilation and damages the Indian Stores suffered; however at the time Mr. Molloy returned, search was made for goods and every exertion made to discover the offenders. but as nothing appeared to be sufficiently founded to criminate the soldiers of the Rangers, I did not care to trouble His Excellency the Commander in Chief with a letter on the occasion; I am however extremely mortiﬁed that I did not as His Excellency seems to consider this circumstance as having the appearance of neglect on my part, the enclosed letters from Mr. White and Lieut. Cowell will further serve to explain this matter and in mitigation I have also to plead that no copy of Survey or Report whatever has as yet been made to me from Detroit River. It vexes me exceedingly that even at this period I cannot give His Excellency any satisfactory information. Agreeably to His orders. Serjeant Walker. Lance-Corporal Thompson 8: Private McLaughlin are conﬁned, but as Lieut. Cowell’s letter appears to me to clear Walker, I have thought proper to conﬁne him to his Barrack only, the other two are in the Guard House. Mr. White assures me nothing (under the present cir- cumstances of the case) can be done with the prisoners, they shall however remain in conﬁnement until His Excellency’s pleasure is known. Jobson, Butler & Johnson also mentioned in Mr. Sewell’s report deserted from the Post of Chippawa the 13th of August last. The person whose name Mr. White does not recollect was Lance Corporal Thompson who attended here for the purpose of being examined by the magistrates four or ﬁve days.

I cannot in any propriety justify this conduct at the same time in consequence of your remarks of the 3d November covering those of Mr. John Craigs, I must detail some cir- cimstances relative thereto.

CAPT. MAYNE TO CAPT. JAMES GREEN 509 plained of the Indian Department having a power unlimited to expend King’s Stores to strengthen my assertions I inclosed a Return of the quantity of Provision consumed by them during a period of near three months I then check’d in a degree the Magnitude of Issues to them conceiving the number of Indians in the Country could not require so much Provision, I had not at this date any reason to fear a scarcity of Provisions at this Post. On the 26h of September I made the loan as reported to you to the United States. On the 2nd October Capt. Drummond’s Detachment of Royal Canadian Volunteers arrived here on their way to relieve the Queen’s Rangers at St Josephs, they had direc- tions to receive provisions at this Post, It was at this time that the Loan I made appeared to me to be injudicious 8; that it might be productive of much inconvenience to His Majesty’s Service. It was not untill I feared a scarcity of Pork and it was at this crisis that the Deputy Commissary Mr. Reynolds stated to me the probability of the same previous to the Spring if the magnitude of the issues to the Indian department were not curtailed. It was now that I wrote to Major Shank to supply me with Pork if he could from Niagara which he was prevented doing by accident. It was at this time that I informed you of this, and the probability of this Post being in want of Pork, when I did so I informed you that I could replace with an equal quantity of good fresh Beef, the provision I had lent to Major General Wayne should circumstances in the course of the Winter require the same. I did not receive your Letter bearing date the 17h October 1796 untill the following December. I am happy in adding that no ill consequences has ensued from my conduct nor has the Garrison experienced any distress. As I had not on the receipt of your Letter of the 2511 Nov. furnished any beef to replace the loan nor arranged this negotiation, I lately thought proper considering all cir- cumstances to receive from the United States as a compensa- tion for the same, one thousand nine hundred and ﬁfty Dol-

The Beef the United States could furnish us would be very bad. I have experienced much uneasiness concerning this mat- ter & as much relative to an order issued by Major Shank which I do myself the pleasure to enclose. I thought I was doing well to His Majesty’s Service when I sent Charles Mullholland to Detroit, at this time Desertion was great in my Detachment which I had no method of preventing. _ I sent Charles Mullholland with my pardons to some men that had Deserted from the Service & who I was informed were desirous of returning to their Colors, having repented of their foul crime. The Commandant of Detroit took umbrage at this 8: con- ﬁned Mullholland, on which I had an interview with General Wayne. I took an opportunity of expressing how much it was my desire that the British Garrison and that of the United States on this River should mutually agree in amity & understanding. That if he General Wayne or any other Commanding ofﬁcer of the Troops of the United States had thought proper to send His pardon to Deserters from their service who might be near my command I should be pleased that they returned I should not have conﬁned the messenger. General Wayne declared Mullholland’s conﬁnement was a mistake and released him. he further informed me that he had given positive orders that no deserters1 from the British army should be enlisted in that of the United States. The Block Houses are weather boarded, I trust His Excellency Genera] Prescott will authorize the payment for the materials & workmanship on account thereof. The Winter prevented me from enclosing the Wood 8'. Timber Yards of course now these services will not be carried on. The Barrack Master informs me that Co].

Immediately upon receiving the Storekeeper Generals directions, I put all the men I could spare at work, cleared the spot for the building 8: got a considerable quantity of Square Timber before Mr. Leacy’s arrival which was on the 23d Inst. by whom I received your letter of the 13th Feby last with the new Barrack Regulations, 8: one of the 8h of April with general orders. I have taken the liberty of sending the amount of the expence of the additional buildings I found necessary on my arrival at this post, to the storekeeper general, which I hope will meet His Excellency the Commander in Chief’s approbation. Had I been honored with your letter in due time I would not have incurred any further expence, but from the circumstance of giving up the Different posts to the Americans. and not knowing exactly the dis- position of the Indians I thought it would be imprudent not to Picket in our present situation, which I took upon myself to do, in hopes it would meet with the Commander in Chiefs assent. I am happy to inform you that the Indians in this Quarter, visits this Post, the same as they formerly did at Michilimackiuac, and appears to be as friendly as usual. There was an Oatway Chieff, whom Governor Simcoe gave a Medal & a Flag to on acct. of his good behaviour among the Indians. particularly as a Warrior, applied to me for a commission, which I did not think myself authorized to give, and put him off by promising to let the Commander in Chief know his wishes, and to acquaint him with his Excellency’s determination.

Present. Lieut Forbes Royal Artillery Ensign Browne Queen’s Rangers. Captain Johnny Speaker Friend, We have come here to say a little to you to open your ears & to be attentive to us. Friend, 7 ' Some time ago when our Nation with other Indian Nations were driven by the Americans to this side our great Father’s Fort on the Miamis River Colonel McKee who for many years had been our great friend told us that he was still so & that he would always pay attention to us 8:. would see that our great Father King George would take great care of us. It appears to us friend that Col. McKee does not now take notice of his children. We know that the greatest part of the ﬁne presents that our great Father sends to us he keeps behind for his own use. We have strong information 8: knowledge among ourselves that he disposes likewise of some of these presents which our great Father over the great salt water sends to us. Friend Capt Elliott last summer mentioned to us that Col. McKee had sat 1Bonner, Cf. supra, p. 651.

Elliott then told us that he would take care of us. he shcwed us a quantity of presents which he told us the great Father of us all intended for us—and our other Indian Brothers. “'e do not know what to make of this Capt. Elliott. He gives us but very few presents, when ﬁrst Col. McKee left us he took pity upon us 8: used us well of late Capt. Elliott does not take such pity of us as formerly he did, he told us the other day that he had nothing to do with us that we were to go to our Father in the Garrison and get our pro- visions there. Friend, This is one reason why we come to you now we wish to know who has the care of us now we have been driven from one father to another. Capt. Elliott told us that you the warrior had said that we could only receive provisions from their great Father once in 7 days, we wish you would alter what you have said & let us receive provisions twice in 7 days instead of once. “'e have said these few words to you Friend as our great Father for a long time back has taken great care of us. We return him our hearty thanks and we expect our great Father will take care of us yet. We did look upon you as our friend we begun to think you a Father we have always found you kind & good to us when we have come to see you, you have taken notice of us & fed us. we have now some Shawonoe Brothers in the land we left to the Americans. They inform us they expect to be ill used, they will therefore join us in this land of our good Fathers. The forefathers of these our Brothers who are old mcn now very particularly knew how well we were with our great Father the King of Gt Britain some of them went to visit him over the great waters since which time our nation have always liked our great Father 8: we will never leave this so good a Father. The Forefathers of these our Brothers fully related to our Nation what had passed between them 8: their great Father over the great “’aters 8: of his promises which we have always found to be true. As we repeated before he has as long as we remember taken care of his children. Captain Wm. Mayne Speaker Children, I have opened my ears and listened to "what you have now said. Children, Your Father Colonel McKee always had 8: has now directions from

Elliott is one of the friends of Colonel McKee. He is desired to be kind to you and your Brothers and to use you well which I am sure he will do. Children, You ask me who has the care of you now. Your great Father has appointed Col. McKee who knows you well (in his absence Capt. Elliott) to inform me of your wants which have always been supplied. You shall have your provisions twice in seven days instead of once. Children, I can assure you your great Father over the Great water loves you 8: will use you as his children.

I have always thought that I received orders & instructions only from you, the Supt. or others my superiors in the Dept. but Capt.

When I am oﬁicially informed that such is the case I shall be obedient, but as yet- his orders on the store have not been taken as Vouchers for issues, which I have reason to think is one great reason for his antipathy against the Indian Dept. in general.

I arrived here on the 22nd 8: took command on the 2411 ultimo. I have since received your Letters of the 21st 8: 30h June 8: in compliance with the former have ordered the Board of Survey on the Gun Powder as directed; the proceedings of which I enclose for the Commander in Chief’s Information. The contents of the letter, con- veying proposals for repairing the Ottawa &c shall likewise be duly attended to, and shall be forwarded by me as much as possible con- sistent with the strength of the garrison; I have however to observe that the number of our men now at this Post is scarcely sufﬁcient to carry on the multiplicity of work already in hand, Chieﬂy performed by soldiers & that should there be any additional work ordered, it will be very difficult if not impracticable to carry it into execution with our present numbers, considering that we have several old men, but ill calculated for Laborious work, I have notwithstanding the satisfaction to ﬁnd the work go on chearfully and I believe with more expedition than in the time of our predecessors Capt. Vigrean’s (Joseph Vignau)1 Company being almost all recruits & totally undisciplined I conceive it would have been more condusive to His Majesty’s service had Col. McDonell kept him at the Head Quarters of the Regt & sent an older Company in their place by that means they might have had a better opportunity 8: more leisure for instruction. I am further obliged to say that I labour under great inconvenience from the ignorance of the oﬂicers as well as the men in every point of their duty. His Excellency may rest assured that as far as depends on me nothing shall be wanting to carry his orders compleately into execu- tion, but I repeat it our numbers are too few, had Col. McDonell sent the Lt. Infantry or indeed any other Company we could do better particularly as I could not trust the recruits on guard until they had been some time at Drill which made the Duty heavier on the rest. Neither the ofﬁcers nor men’s Quarters are as yet ﬁnished. The mag- azine but begun a few days previous to my arrival. The Frame of the Store House not yet up and the wharf only begun. I must however do the Engineer Lieut Cooper the justice to say that he is very assid- uous & attentive. I cannot as yet pretend to pass an opinion on any thing at the Post, but I can already perceive that the expenses of the Indians are enormous particularly in the consumption of provisions 8: I think may in some degree be checked without the least detriment to 1See supra p. 534.

CAPT. M'LEAN TO CAPT. GREEN 525 the service but quite the reverse. I ﬁnd that some time previous to my arrival here some Indians had been sent towards the Mississippi with a view to gain intelligence of the Spaniards in that Quarter, they are soon expected to return. when if they bring any intelligence it shall be communicated. My reasons for mentioning this are that I suppose His Excellency is already apprized of the apparent Hostile disposition of the Spaniards in that Quarter towards the United States, by refusing to deliver up agreeable to Treaty the Posts within their Boundary Line on the frivolous pretence of guarding against an Expedition from Canada & instead of laying out the Line of Division employing the men intended for that purpose in strengthening the Fortiﬁcations of the Natchez & Walnut hills.

Mc Lean conveying a supposition that the Damage arose. from neglect, and to enable them to decide clearly on the whole. the Board likewise proceeded to the examination of the following evidences. Mr. Reynolds Depy (fornmisy. and Store Keeper being called and examined as follows. Question 1st. Was the Felicity the best place for the security of the Powder? Answr. Coin. England thought so. as the rest of the Transport were employed & no other place of security could be provided. 2nd. Was the Felicity put in repair for the reception of the Powder and what were the repairs? ‘ Answr. Yes she had platforms laid on beams above her Keelson 8: was built in the manner of a (,‘orn Ship when they received their Cargo in Bulk, her Pumps were put in as good repair as possible. the powder .was then put on board the Vessel. as well as the ﬁxed Ammunition. She then left Detroit & was anchored at this Post when Capt. Salmon took the Command, she was moored according to his direction, and unrigged, she then was covered with a Temporary Roof, such as was thought suﬂicient to keep the water off the Deck, & to prevent any wet going thro' by the way of the mast. there was a Coat well Tarr‘d put round above the Temlmrary Roof. 3d. What do you suppose after the above repairs was the cause of the Damage of the powder? Answer. That the temporary magazine which was then building not being ﬁnished for the reception of the Powder & the severity of the winter setting in sooner than usual, by which the Pumps were choaked with Ice. makes me suppose that those Barrels which are damaged have sustained it from the impossibility of pumping out the water. 4th. Under whose charge was the Powder on board the Felicity? Answ". In charge of the Conductor of Artillery.

CAPT. M'LEAN TO CAPT. GREEN 527 5th. Were there any reports made to you that the vessel was leaky? Answ'. No. _ Mr. Labry ship Carpenter who was at the ﬁtting out of the Felicity as a Temporary Magazine called & examined. 1st. What repairs were made to the Felicity to ﬁt her for the reception of gun Powder? Answl'. She was ceil’d and had Platforms laid, as well as her pumps put in order and a Temporary Roof put over her, and was moor’d in the River after the Powder was on Board. Mr. Hutchins who work’d on Board the Felicity call‘d. 1st. What repairs were made by you on Board the Felicity? Answr. Ceiling helping to lay Platforms putting Pumps in repair and making a Temporary Roof as_well as Coating the mast above it. she afterwards was moor‘d in the River. The court having duly considered the matter before them 8: the state of the Gun Powder as above expressed are clearly of opinion that the damage did not proceed from any neglect but merely from the following causes vizt 1st. The impossibility of procuring any other place of Deposit but the Felicity. Bad. The Temporary Magazine not being ﬁnished untill the 29th December last, occasioned the necessity of keeping the Gun Powder in the Felicity untill that late period of the season. _ 3d. The Severity of the Season setting in earlier than usual, and the impossibility of Pumping out the water converted into Ice by the extreme severity of the cold. THOS.

Two men of the Maria being likewise discharged in the same predicament. I have upon application granted one man to assist in navigating that vessel to proceed to Fort Eric 8.: the Francis to St. Joseph—The mcn went on board with reluctance I was not authorized to oﬁer them any extra allowance. We have no intelligence from the Mississippi side 8: every thing seems to be in a state of tranquility. The intelligence most to be depended upon must either be through the Americans or our own Traders, who are most interested. Those having the direction of the Indian Dept. in this vicinity seem most eagerly to seize at every idle tale, which they never fail to magnify & exaggerate to answer their own private. views.

536 INDIAN AFFAIRS whatever, which seems to have been hitherto too much the case as is evident from their wealth (particularly Mr. Elliott) which them inso- lent and independent even of the Government itself. The consumption of provisions by Indians even for the short time that I have been here is astonishing & seems to encrease &. tho’ I have neglected all requisitions for casual 8: incidental issues, that is when no Indians appeared 8: no nation in particular speciﬁed in the Requisition such as they were formerly in the habit of making to be at their own private disposal. yet I ﬁnd that their other requisitions for Indians have been so frequent and so large that the issues have been considerable in so short a space of time as will appear by the return inclosed. The Indians in general in the vicinity of this place now come in weekly when there is a general delivery of a week's provisions in presence of the ofﬁcers of the Garrison, but there is hardly a day but some small detached parties of different Nations come in to be vict- ualled besides. As it can hardly be supposed that this consumption is meant always to continue, It would be well if some mode was adopted to diminish it gradually so as in the course of time to abolish it altogether without risquing the disaffection of the Indians; I cannot however pretend to decide whether or not the present may in point of policy be a proper time for the adoption of such mode, 8: I am perfectly aware that the profusion with which things have been lavished on them renders a change the more difﬁcult; for instance if instead of coming in once a week they were directed to come in once a fortnight 8: then to receive only the same quantity they now receive weekly, that is half allowance they might probably exert themselves to make up the difference by their own industry in hunting &c instead of a total dependence on Govt. 8:. relinquishing every other means of subsistence as at present. I have been credibly informed that the Bounty of Govt. has been an injury to many of them by encouraging indolence. “'hatever their agents may assert t0 the contrary, & I have reason to believe that their coming in so often is encouraged by Mr. Elliott. It being impossible to ascertain their exact numbers by returns or otherwise, there must consequently be too much room for abuse 8:. the more frequent the issues the more the abuse; even if they were to have the same allowance they now receive. This abuse would be less by their receiving it once a fortnight, as I have reason to believe that the Requisitions in gen]. are made for more Indians than exist at least in the vicinity.
Page 537
CAPT. M'LEAN TO CAPT. GREEN 537 Tho’ the requisition may be sometimes made for three or four hundred (which indeed it has never exceeded to my knowledge at a time) yet it often happens that not above or forty may appear, these are said to receive the Provisions for their Families & friends that are absent. It is certainly issued out of the provision store but it is not equally certain that its all carried to these Indians said to be absent. I would not however wish to recommend any particular method positively in preference to another lest from want of sufﬁcient experi- ence it might be liable to error 8: counter balanced by more weighty objections. One thing I am positive in is that there are reforms wanted & that these however glaring will never originate with 01' be brought about by any one of the Dept. this way, nor will they even give any information that may lead to such reform. How to point them out requires more knowledge & experience in these matters than I am as yet possessed of. I have not seen Mr. McKee to converse with him on anything relating to this Dept. as he lives chieﬂy at the River Thames at too great a distance for me to think of going from my command 8: he has not been here since my arrival. I conceive that in the delivery of presents to Indians instead of one copy as at present there ought to be two copies of the Requi- sition for these Presents. one for the senior officer super-intending the delivery who might have a non-commissioned oﬂicer with him as clerk employ'd to mark every separate article as it is delivered, which would serve as a check; the officers in general seldom wishing to appear oﬂicious or minute. By this means it would be certain that the pres- ents as per Requisition had been delivered which is far from being certain according to the present mode. If likewise the certiﬁcate of the oﬂicers present at the delivery was to be made the only suﬂicient voucher of the expenditure these people could not think of acting as they do now in precipitating the delivery without them. I think the Instructions are such too, tho’ they are not now before me, how they can evade them I do not know. but I am positive that no officer here will certify a thing he has not seen. The Indians would then receive more & consequently be better pleased. They will even tell us with a view to have every thing at their own disposal, that the Indians are adverse to having their provisions issued 8: weighed to them in the King’s Store (tho’ we have convincing proofs of the contrary) Because as they say it looks too much like soldiers however extraordinary this may appear it is the language of the Indian Storekeeper. In short they are fertile in every expedient that may tend to promote their own interested views 8: never fail to make a thousand different pleas 8:

538 INDIAN AFFAIRS difﬁculties in the name of the Indians that never entered their Heads. If a Commanding ofﬁcer of a Post were to wink at irregularities 8: expenditures without bounds and to sacriﬁce His Majesty’s service to his own case and convince‘ these people would be perfectly satisfy’d and approve of his conduct without attending in the least to any bad consequences that might ensue. The Indian Store being at so great a distance as Mr. Elliott’s House (above a mile) makes it rather incon- venient for the ofﬁcers to attend at every delivery of presents particu- larly at such short notice as they give, generally at the dinner hour. This Distance likewise renders peculation the more easy 8: detection the less so. I think that should there be room enough when the new store is ﬁnished it would be best plan to have the Indian Stores removed, even if there should be a place built for the storekeeper, tho’ in the mean time room might be made for him in any one of the Block Houses. This would save government the expense of storage now charged by Mr. Elliott on whom I cannot help making a few remarks. He lives as I am informed in the greatest afﬂuence at an expense of above a thousand a year. He possesses an extensive farm not far from the garrison stock’d with about six or seven head of cattle & I am told employs ﬁfty or sixty persons constantly about his house 8: farm chieﬂy slaves. If the question should be asked, How these people are fed & cloathed 8: how his wealth has been accumulated, I shall not undertake to give a positive answer, but the general opinion of people better acquainted with these matters is well known. Finding that there was nothing more at Fort Erie to be forwarded to this Post than the Schooner Maria brought the last trip, I have sent her likewise to St. Joseph with Indian Stores some provisions &c. ' &c. so that one trip more of the Francis Sloop will be sufﬁcient to convey to that Post every article that may be wanted for the season they are already victualled at least to the 24h June 1798. Everything here goes on pretty well considering our small numbers the magazine will I think be nearly compleated by the close of this month. The wharf is sunk 8: the most difﬁcult part of it ﬁnished. There remains little more than the Bridge to join it to the shore. The Ottawa is pretty forward in caulking. In consequence of the incessant sollicita- tion of the ofﬁcers to have their quarters made something comfortable, I was under the unavoidable necessity of directing some of the car- penters to be employ’d for that purp0se, which has in some measure retarded the store. but as they have now begun to put it up I am in hopes it will be covered in a few days and that no material inconven- ience may arise from the delay. lProbably convenience.

A few days ago a Requisition was brought me from Mr. Elliott for presents to be delivered to Indians. I accordingly signify’d my appro- bation by signing it but soon after recollecting that it was necessary the ofﬁcers of the Garrison should attend I sent a subaltern ofﬁcer down to Mr. Elliott to know when they should be delivered his answer was, It was no matter the presents would be delivered when they 8: the Indians were ready, 8: that the ofﬁcers had nothing to do with it. Yesterday1 morning at ten o‘clock a requisition of a similar nature was brought by the Indian Storekeeper who on my asking him when the presents were to be delivered answered in the course of the day, upon which I immediately wrote at the bottom thus, “approved & to be delivered in presence of the. ofﬁcers at twelve o’clock,” which the storekeeper did not Observe until] his return home, and communicated with Mr. Elliott There was a Serjeant immediately sent to warn the ofﬁcers accordingly. The Store keeper on his return Observing however at the bottom of the requisition that the ofﬁcers were directed to attend wrote me the enclosed note which produced my answer annexed to it likewise enclosed for the satisfaction of His Excellency. The ofﬁcers however attended at the hour directed, but the presents having been previously given away they immediately returned & made the encIOsed Report.2 At the same time that I conceive that it would be better to have given us timely notice particularly as the Indians had been here two whole days before. yet had the storekeeper men- tioned anything of the Presents being ready 8: the impatience (as 1See letter ante pp. 534-5. 2Idem
Page 541
CAPT. M’LEAN TO CAPT. GREEN 541 they pretended) of the Indians; instead of writing me'so after he got home; I would have ordered the ofﬁcers to attend immediately. The same afternoon a requisition was brought me to sign with a message from Mr. Elliott at Four o’clock. That the presents were to be delivered at 4 or half past 4 rather than detain the Indians or give any cause of complaint. I signed it. but the notice was so short as made it impossible for the ofﬁcers to attend at such a distance. With respect to the Pleas of the impatience of the Indians, who were here two days before, it appears to be totally frivolous, as I never saw Indians more regular 8: more tractable. I have communi- cated these circumstances merely to give the Commander in Chief some idea of these Peoples behaviour & disposition.

Capt.

Supt. for Casual & Incidental Issues (as they call them) but as these. were made under pretence of answering the convenience of Indians. lest these people should be put to any inconvenience. M. Elliott was told. that upon his requisition they should always have bread at the Garrison Bakery to be delivered to themselves; they seem‘d satisfy‘d with this mode, it was accordingly adopted & followed for some time. untill I perceived some appearance of an abuse, and that instead of being delivered to Indians, there 'as in general at the rate of twenty four or twenty ﬁve loaves of bread pr. day sent for to the Bakery & carried by Mr. Elliott‘s servants (of which he employs 40 or 50) to his own House. it was consequently never understood that this was meant to be charged to Government & I immediately gave an order to the Commissary, that no bread issued to any person whatever from the Garrison Bakery, should be admitted as a charge against government unless delivered to Indians for their own use. The Baker soon after went to the (‘ormnissary with Mr. Elliott’s tickets to receive flour for them. but the Commissary perceiving that the tickets speciﬁed no nation or number of Indians‘& were without date, concluded that they were for Mr. Elliott’s private use wou‘d issue no ﬂour for them 011 Govt. account. Mr. Elliott upon this applied to me, when he was told that whenever any proper Voucher appeared for the delivery of Bread for Indians. it should be immediately admitted as a charge against Govt. as well as some delivered during Capt. Mayne’s command which he likewise claimed.
Page 549
CAPT. M’LEAN TO CAPT. GREEN 5-19 I have not heard anything from them since on the subject of Bread & imagine upon representing this through the Supt. General in their usual way they expect to have things to their wish. As the Indians receive such frequent 8.: ample supplies of ﬂour this can be attended with no inconvenience to them. particularly as they received so little of it, these people seem very well satisﬁed & very regular in their behaviour 8: their attachment to Govt. being only founded on their own interest will always continue while they are fed & cloathed & its of little consequence to them who delivers it, providing they receive it; whatever their agents say to the contrary; I am informed a pernicious practice prevails in the Dept of taking things out of the Store 8: bar- tering one commodity for another with the Merchants. As this must open a wide door for abuse it ought to be prevented. The Requisition for Indian Goods for next year was brought to me to approve, & tho’ I cant Judge of the number of things that may be necessary yet rather than retard the service I approved it. They them- selves admit & even complain. that the one half of last yeals requisition was detained below by the Supt. General & there being no great want previous to the arrival of the Presents for this year shows that their requisition was at least double the quantity necessary. particularly as there appears no complaint on the part of the Indians. There ought always to be two Copies of the lequisitions for presents one to remain with the Commg. Oﬁicer at the Post so that on a com- parison between these at the expiration of the year & the supplies for that year the quantity remaining in store will appear. providing there is no irregularity in the delivery. Notwithstanding my directions to Mr. Elliott to give timely notice of the delivery of presents to Indians we never knew of it until the moment of the delivery, so that the ofﬁcers have hardly ever time to attend. tho’. the Indians are generally here two days before the presents are never given to them until the moment they are going off.

The Spaniards at “St. Louis retired from that Post on the 12th Ulto. & precipitately “descended the Mississippi with their ﬂotilla leaving eighteen men “only to keep the Post; of consequence all Ideas of Indian Hostility “are at present Chimerical and are therefore most probably urg’d at “this time to support that infamous system of venality 8.: Plunder “which has visibly marked the progress of the Indian department in “this quarter.” As I have written by the Francis which sailed this morning I have nothing more to say than that the store is up 8: will be covered in a. week & I think the magazine will be nearly com- pleated in about three weeks.

It is next to impossible perfectly to prevent the peculation of the ofﬁcers of the Indian Department in the service of His Majesty and residing in the vicinity of Amherstburg, at the same time the evil may be greatly checked. The ofﬁcer in command there has a sufﬁcient power of restraining the same 8: suppressing overt deviations from the rules prescribed. The Indian Settlements on the Chenail Ecarte 8: on the River La Franche (or Thames) are not so distinctly remote from the garrison of Amherstburg but that the local Indians might appear at Amherstburg to receive there their annual presents.

JOSEPH CHEW TO CAPT.

It was a difﬁcult thing during my command at Amherstburg to induce them to act up in the Spirit of the general regulations for their good Government, as you will perceive on perusing the enclosed letters1 which I received from Capt. Elliott that will evince to you some of the many trivial excuses which are made by them to evade their proper duty. One great inconvenience arises from a Power of Barber which is given to the Indian Department under this cloak they ﬁll the stores of the merchants before the face of the world. This should in my humble opinion be done away with, the assortment of Stores sent into that country for His Majesty’s Indian Service is amply sufﬁcient. Some method should beiadopted to secure to government the credit of the many presents which (of various kinds) the Indian Department receive from Indian Nations. I have the honor to be Sir Capt.

DEAR SIR The Superintendant General Sir John Johnson will, by this Post, transmit to His Excellency General Prescott a requisition for such goods as will he wanted to enable the General Store here to furnish such articles as are likely to be required from the different stores in the Upper Country and for the Issues in Lower Canada, in the course of the year 1799: For His Excellency’s Information I beg leave to state the grounds on which I have formed this calculation, with the appro-

JOHN LEES TO CAPT. GREEN ' , 553 bation of the Supt. General— Having taken an exact Inventory of the goods in store, a. short time before the arrival of the cargo by the Brig Earl of Marchlnont I added the amount of that cargo thereto. in order to ascertain the quantity of the different articles now in store & to a general state of all the goods sent this year to the Upper Posts, adding thereto the late requisition, from Mr Claus for the Matchedosh Indians & what further Issues are likely to take place this year for the Indians of Lower Canada 8: those near Kingston—I deducted the amount thereof from the amount of the goods, now in store, to ascer- tain what articles will remain next Fall, taking as a principle that the requisitions of next year will be nearly the same as they have been in the course of the present and, proceeding on the same principal that the Requisitions for the year 1799 will be nearly the same as those for 1797, I added to the articles which were calculated to remain in store here next Fall, such other articles as will enable the General Store here to furnish in the year 1799 a supply equal to that of the present year. which are then stated in the present requisition: As none of the Requisitions for the ensuing year have yet come to hand from the Upper Country, and probably will not for some time, nor any informa- tion respecting them, this was the only Datum on which I could act and I think that with the addition of the present Requisition, the Stores here will be able to supply all the Requisitions that will be made in the course of the two years ensuing. Inclosed you have for His Excellency"s information, a Letter with the enclosures which I received a few days ago by return of the extra Conductor from Mr. Ironside Stkl' at Detroit. If it did not appear by the copy of Capt. McLean’s Letter, that he intended to make a report on the subject I would not have thought .it worth while to trouble His Excellency on it; It appears to me that Mr Ironside has acted in the manner that has alway been customary in the Upper Posts, to apply on the arrival of any goods for a Survey to ascertain if any of them are damaged, that the Conductor who had them in charge may account for it. what appears to me as most extraordinary in this case, is that the Report of Survey is dated the 30h August & Capt McLean takes no notice of the business till the 1111 Sept. The Report States that 112% yds striped cotton 8: 10 of net thread were totally damaged & some few articles were, but not unserviceable, all the rest were in good order. The value of the goods damaged is £12 168 11d Stg; The extra conductor says the goods were obliged to lie out of doors covered with oiled cloaths for several days. at Fort Erie, during which it rained very hard for 24 hours. I expect Mr Molloy the Conductor of the

The contents of which I communicated to Mr. Elliott, who did not think proper to comply with Gen]. Wilkinson’s request in sending the Interpreter Day to Fort Wayne. It is supposed this Interpreter had propagated false Reports among the Indians of that vicinity & that General “'ayne’s anxiety to have him sent after him to Fort Wayne was merely to confront him with the Indians so as to nndeceive them in his presence. On that account & having no reason to doubt Mr. “’ilkinson’s sincerity, It was my wish that the man should have been sent. but the views of that Dept. are dilferent.

CAPT. M’LEAN TO CAPT. GREEN 557 CAPT. HECTOR MC LEAN TO CAPT. JAMES GREEN AMHERs'rREne (Amherstburg) 1811 Oct. 1797. SIR I have to acknowledge the receipt of your Letters of the 1011 and 14h 8: 15h ulto. & I assure you the contents will be duly attended to. The Ottawa is now ready to sail 8: I lament much she could not have been ready sooner by reason of the only two carpenters having been both sick 8; unable to ﬁnish the caulking earlier, which occas- ioned the delay, the rigging of the vessel having been soon compleated by the exertion 8: under the immediate direction of Captain Grant him- self, who is of opinion she will still be able to make two trips this season which with one trip of the Francis when she returns from St. Joseph will I imagine leave very little if anything for this Post at Fort Erie. The Fire Engines is compleatly repaired, & will be kept in good order; an account of the expense will be transmitted as soon as it is made out by the Engineer. I have now sent a Requisition for ﬁfty Leather Bucketts for this Post, which I hope will be suﬂicient. The 24 you mention to have been ordered up I wish may arrive in time & may probably be sufﬁcient for this season. The Engineer has always had every possible aid towards carrying on the different works that this Garrison could aﬂ’ord without harassing the Troops, tho’ I must own that things are not in such a state of forwardness as I could have wished or indeed expected. The chief cause of which it must however be admitted, is the weakness of the Garrison & the number of old & feeble of which it in a great measure consists. Mr. Reynolds the Depy. Commy. having represented to me the necessity there will be for having a good Blacksmith to make and repair axes for cutting ship Timber as well .as to perform .such work as may be wanted for the purpose of ﬁtting out the vessels in the spring. I have accordingly authorized him to engage one for these necessary purposes which I hope may be approved by the Commander in Chief. Building an Indian Store as soon as circumstances can permit will I conceive be a very necessary measure as well for the convenience 8: security of having the Stores in Garrison as to save the exhorbitant charge of £60 pr annum made by Mr. Elliott for room that could not be converted to any other material use. I apprehend there can be no difﬁculty in obtaining permission from the Indians to cut timber on the Indian Reserve Land for a small Present, or perhaps without, unless Mr. McKee whom I understand is
Page 558
558 INDIAN AFFAIRS a little interested himself should persuade them to enhance the value of it. ' I enclose for His Excellency‘s satisfaction a memorandum received from a member of the Land Board to which the consideration of this Land was referr’d by Lord Dorchester. when applied to for a grant of it by Col. McKee, as it may serve to throw some light on this trans— action; 8: I’m credibly informed that the four or ﬁve Indian families now settled upon this land are even hir’d to keep possession of it for the Head of the Department himself. Inclosed is a return of the Indians now settled at the Chenail Ecarte amounting to one hundred and sixty men. women and children. I have reason to think it is accurate from having received it from the Principal Chief settled there, who came down here three days ago. His name is Bold or Onagan. He is a man well known to be of good character and inﬂuence among them. I took him to my room and received the Information by the Interpretation of a young man that likewise lives there 8: was taken prisoner by the Indians 13 years ago 8: still lives among them, he tells me it agrees with the returns of Fisher an Interpreter who is employed there as Issuer of provisions but who bye the bye is too much under the Inﬂuence of the Head of the Department for me to' expect any information from him. There are about 50 men 50 women 60 children 8: have only 18 or 19 habitations chieﬂy occupied by two Families each; on my expressing some surprise at the small proportion the number of children bore to the number of men 8: women be accounted for it by saying that they were chieﬂy old men whose children had come to maturity & were reckoned among the men and women & that they were not so proliﬁc as white people. He was positive the number did not exceed 160—& I have no reason to doubt him as it could not be his interest to fall short of the real number. I have some time ago required Mr. Elliott to send me a return of these people acquainting him at the same time that I was call’d upon by the Commander in Chief for it but he paid no attention to my request. I have three days ago (previous to receiving the return from the Chief Bold) sent Lieut Fraser up to the Village accompanied by a. man who speaks the Language tolerably well. with orders to visit every habitation 8: to bring me the best information; he is not yet returned, but should he arrive previous to the sailing of the vessel to-morrow morning his return likewise shall be sent. The Department have a few days ago made a Requisition for six months provisions for ﬁve hundred 8: forty three Indians men, women

CAPT. M'LEAN TO CAPT. GREEN 559 8: children in order to ﬁx a depot at the Chenail Ecarte for that number said by them to be settled there, I have not as yet determined whether or not to comply with it to the full extent particularly as they have not furnished me with a regular return, and that it so widely ditfers from the return given me by the Chief Bold. When Lieut Fraser returns I shall be more competent to decide; But whatever determination I may come to, in this or any other way respecting these matters shall be such as may affect the Interest & His Excellency may rest assured that no zeal even to correct abuses will carry me so far as to risque the dis- pleasure of the'Indians, or in the least degree to tend to alienate their attachment to the government. The Intention not being to diminish their allowance in this Instance. In looking over a copy of the Military Secretary‘s Letter of the 20h April last to Mr. McKee, I observe that the Issues at the Chenail Ecarte are directed to be made in presence of one or more ofﬁcers of the Dept. I believe this has never- been complied with; at least since I have been here 8: it may not be perhaps very material. I likewise observe in the same letter that the allowance of extra provisions for Indians driven from their quarters was for 3500 which appears to me from every information I can obtain to be greatly exag- gerated I can with certainty that the number of that discription victualled here and at the Chenail Ecarte now or at any time during my command did not amount to a third of that number. as those in the vicinity of this place regularly fed here, even by their own returns are but about 360 and never to my knowledge amounted Four hundred men, women & children, and those at the Chenail Ecarte about 160 or even according to their own returns not more than 543 persons. & I can venture to say without any risque of being contradicted. that between both places they cannot produce 200 able bodied men nor per- haps even 150—1 only mean of those driven from their possessions & now fed by us. Diﬂ’erent methods may 'be taken to check irregularities 8: abuses in the Department, but I see no etfectual method of putting a stop to them but by getting the Indians to appear to .receive their own presents & provisions & if even in this way they should be allowed a greater share I am conﬁdent there would be a considerable saving to government. Those who are conversant with the manners of the Indians & know the facility with which they move in canoes with their whole families will readily allow that they could not consider this a diﬁ‘iculty when it tended to their own beneﬁt. I have reason to think that the Heads of the Dept. ﬁnding themselves \

I will even venture to assert that it would be good policy to withold from them the daily supplies of provisions now given. Should no other mode _ prove etfectnal to prevent their remaining so long, 8: probably at last taking their departure stripped of everything received out of the King’s Store.

Mayne dated 20h April last that the provisions to be delivered to the Indians at the (,‘henail Ecarte Settlement. must be upon returns made by the Deputy Superintendant General of the nmnber the familys consist of that are to be victualled & approv’d of by the oﬁicer commanding at Amherst- burg. I have therefore to request that you will have the goodness to furnish such returns and should you deem it absolutely necessary that a depot should be ﬁx’d there for the winter. to send a requisition for that purpose, as I cannot be justiﬁed in approving of any other. As it however appears that the Indians of that settlement are soon to depart for their hunting ground 8: not to return till Spring I cannot see the necessity of sending more provisions there this fall than will be sufficient to carry them to their hunting places. particularly as they may have provisions on their return—should it be the intention of govt. to continue this indulgence so long. Your sentiments on that head will of course have due weight 8: I beg the favor of you to com- municate them by this opportunity, that your intention may be clearly understood. Perceiving a considerable number of Indians frequently remain at this post for a length of time previous to receiving their presents & after being in possession of them are an immense expense to govt. and much to their own prejudice. by disposing of both pro- visions 8: presents for rum, there have been even between 150 8: 200 Potawatamies 8: Chippawas here lately from the 14h to the 24h October without any requisition made for their presents 8: chieﬂy in a state of intoxication not from any rum received in or about the garrison as I have given positive orders against it. This being I conceive an abuse of the govt.

I do recommend for the good of the King's service that the following Provisions be sent to the Indian Department of Chenail Ecarte for the use of the Indians that resort that place during the Winter. 500 Bushels Indian Corn \ 50 Barrels of Flour 25 Barrels of Pork 25 Barrels of Pease [signed] A. MC Km: D. S. G. I. A. [c 250, p 340] COL. ALEXANDER MC KEE TO CAPT. HECTOR MC LEAN RIVER THAMES SIR, November 5th 1797. I am to acknowledge the receipt of your Letter of the 27th Octr. in answer to which I have to observe that some time ago the princi- pal Indians of the Settlement of Chenail Ecarte came to me to request (in the name of their People) an allowance of provisions to enable them to hunt in the neighborhood of that place (as the game is not sufﬁciently plenty) in order to be ready early in the spring to plant their Corn Fields, as the great distance they were obliged to go on the South Side of the Lake in search of game to support their Families. had hitherto prevented their returning in time to plant. which was the cause of the failure in their Crops of Corn. how many of them remain at this late season I cannot pretend to say I have ever in com- pliance with their desire at that time directed the Superintendant to make a Requisition for the provisions that would be necessary for the number of Indians that might probany remain near or resort that
Page 568
568 INDIAN AFFAIRS place during the Winter and as they were at that time going down to Amherstbiu'g to receive their annual supplies he would be better able to Judge then of the number of families that would be likely to return in consequence of their request to me, at the same time it being in conformity to my instructions to encourage the Indians who are friendly to the King‘s Interest to attach themselves as much as possible to the Settlement of Chenail Ecarte. I may therefore consider a small depot of provisions for their use during the winter necessary then in case of their being in want, to be issued to them under the Regulations, what Provisions may be left, if any, will remain safe in the hands of those who have the charge of them. An oﬁicer of the department will reside there with directions imme~ diatcly to collect the number of Indians who have returned & will be depending upon Provisions there. I am greatly surprised to hear that any unnecessary delays of Indians are suffered about the Posts by the Superintendant (that may be in his power to prevent) having always been considered as a diligent & Zealous ofﬁcer & I have on all occasions pressed his particular attention to sending them away with all possible dispatch. But if Rum is per- mitted to be retailed to them they are ungovernable while intoxicated. which is also an improper time to distribute their supplies to them. The abuse of selling Burn 8: buying their clothing with it prevails too much in every part of the Country & requires a law to be strictly put in execution to remedy the Evil.

It may perhaps be a matter worthy of consideration whether every requisition should come thro' the Supt. or whether they are all to be approved as hitherto without echption. The Coming. Ot'tice ' at present has no power to reward any Indians without the consent of the Supt. which is almost an insuperable Bar to his obtaining any information relating to the Dept. Little information relative to this department having been hitherto received at Head Quarters excepting thro’ these people themselves & the Comm“. in Chief being at so great a distance was difﬁcult for liiln to decide upon the measures that ought to have been adopted. It is however easy to discern that whatever Innovation or changes are desir‘d by the Dept. are in gen]. selﬁsh. The dept. wish to make a. mystery of everything relating to Indians & to have it understood that none can manage them but themselves whereas the reverse is the case & merchts. who speak to & deal with them chieﬂy by signs manage them full as well. Govt has been too much imposed when in this predicament which has always been a Bar to reform. Inﬂuence with Indians depends chiefly on what is given them. The Indians that receive presents 8: are fed here in genl. & receive presents & are fed by the Americans 8: were told by General Wilkin- son that as both nations were like Brothers they might place the ﬂag received from here & the British Flag together & that whoever injured the one was no friend to the other. Nothing ever to fear from the Indians while at peace with America, and even in case of war the Indians being totally guarded by Inter- ests & not principle will side with the best bidder, tho' in general rather prejudiced against the Americans. Previous to approving of the Requisition for next year the ofﬁcer commanding ought always to know what remains of the last year's stores. - The chief part of the Speeches 8: arguments used by their Agents 8: Superintendants in the name of the Indians fabricated by them- selves. chieﬂy tending to their own Interest. probably never entered the Heads nor issued from the lips of the Indians.

I therefore enclose for his informa- tion Copies of Letters3 from me to Mr. Elliott without any answer on his part, excepting a verbal one to that of the 23d Oct. as appears at the bottom of that Letter. Indeed Mr. Elliott himself is too illiterate to make any other than a verbal answer but on other occasions he employs a clerk. Agreeable to a general order at this Post dated the 12b of April 1788 directing a copy of the stores forwarded to the respective Upper Posts for the Indians to be sent to the Commanding oﬂicer to be sur- vey‘d by him, on their arrival with those remaining of the former Year that the state & condition of all be reported annually. I required the Storekeeper Ironside to send me such a Copy accordingly; His answer was that he had orders of a later date by which to regulate his con- duct, and it is probable that may be the case, but this order was mani- festly intended for the good of His Majesty's Service & a compliance- with it on his part certainly could not have injured that service. 8: this serves to show how little attention they pay to orders, unless the Oﬂicer Commanding knows the quantity of Stores remaining of last year how 1Probably referrlng to Brant. aProbably addressed to James Green, Mll.

FROM CAPT. M'LEAN 575 is he to Judge the propriety of approving the requisition for next year (unless it be a mere matter of form) when most of the articles in that Requisition may be remaining in store for anything he may know. In case it might be thought expedient to frame any new articles of Instructions for the good government of that Dept. or to add to the old ones I have sent enclosed a few remarks which have oecur’d in the Course of my little experience and observation to be submitted to the Commander in Chiefs consideration, that respecting the delivery of presents is in my opinion absolutely necessary & the more particular we are on that head the better pleas’d the Indians. ﬁnding the change of issuing Provisions already very much to their advantage. It is not difficult to discern their motives in encouraging so great a consumption of provisions to Indians at this time and every unprejudiced person here can plainly perceive it; they are much dissatisfy’d with the late change in the mode of delivering the provisions to Indians innnediately out of the stone instead of as formerly (tho’ I believe contrary to instructions then owing perhaps to negligence in some commanding ofﬁcers) giving it to themselves in Bulk to dispose of at their pleasure & by augment- ing the consumption now & calling on all the Indians from distant quarters (which there’s no doubt of their doing) to be vict- ualled, they wish to show that there was no abuse before, and that government is not beneﬁted by the change, merely with a view to get things back into their old channel; But I hope Government will not be so easily imposed upon. It may indeed be true that the consump- tion is now greater than at the period alluded to (& they take care if possible to make it so) but the Indians were not then sent for from all quarters as at present; and when they did come they got much less, we are now certain that the provisions issued (by retail) out of the King‘s Store or at least the chief part of them, are given to the Indians themselves, which was by no means certain before & the present great consumption must soon diminish as the most of the Indians take their departure soon for their Hunting ground & do not return till Spring. When these people ﬁnd their eﬁ'orts fruitless and no Interest in this great consumption themselves they will soon change their mode and the Indians will not come in so frequent after they have received their annual presents, there is no art nor scheme that invantion can form but they try to pester and plague the ofﬁcer com- mending in order to make him sick of the business with a view to have things their own way. When I came here the practice was. on a weekly general delivery of provisions for them to make out one requisition for the probable number to be victualled that Day & the

576 INDIAN AFFAIRS coming ofﬁcer sign’d it. but ﬁnding me particular about seeing the Indians instead of one ticket I have thirty or forty to sign, one for a person from each family, which small tickets were not formerly signed by the ofﬁcer commanding at all. But I believe that they already begin to ﬁnd that their ett'orts to turn me out in this way are fruit- less but when one scheme fails they try another. It would perhaps be proper that government should ﬁx the period when victualling the Indians regularly shon’d cease, that they may have due notice to pro vide for themselves, excepting when bands may accidently come to the Post. in the passing by, when a day’s provisions or more might be given. The Indian Interpreters being solely under their direction they seldom or ever send any of them with Indians to the oﬂicer commanding tho’ there are three at this place chieﬂy employed on their farms & building their Houses drawing provisions & pay regu- larly. I conceive the reason of this to be merely with a view to with- hold from the coming. oﬁicer every information relative to the Dept, but there ought to be an Interpreter constantly under his direction. Thcy still continue to delay making their requisitions for presents for several days after the Indians arrive on the ground & once the requi- sition is approved they are delivered with such precipitation as hardly leaves time to warn the ofﬁcers & not duly warn’d they may probably be out of the way. Anything said to Mr. Elliott on the subject to no purpose they have an idea that the ofﬁcer Commg. has nothing more to do with the department than merely to approve of all their requisi- tions however unreasonable (as in .the case of casual issues) 8: it has been too much the practke. In short the affairs of this Dept. have never been under any con'troll, nor in the habit of receiv— ing or paying attention to the directions of any ofﬁcer Comg the Post & without positive orders 8: Instructions nothing regular can be expected from them. It would ever appear that unless some emolument besides their salary (tho’ very ample) is annexed to their places they hold them of very little consequence. Mr. Elliott has given a return1 & made a requisition copies of which are enclosed of 543 Indians said by him to be determined to stay at the Chenail Ecarte, & which were it not for the return mentioned in my last received from the Chief Bold or rather Bowl of 160 only, I might have been imposed upon to comply with; This return from the Chief Bowl has since been strongly conﬁrmed by the return brought me by Lt. Fraser sent up there for the express purpose of procuring an accn 'ate return. The ﬁrst return Lt. Fraser brought I was not satisfy’d with being 360 persons 8: being informed he. got it from one Lascelle an Interpreter whom I suspected ‘Cf. one. luau—558 and 564.

FROM CAPT. M'LEAN 577 to have been interested 8: the return differing so widely from the Chief Bowl’s Return I sent Lt. Fraser again with orders to visit every house to bring me the number of them 8: of the persons each house contained 8: to get some person to give the number of those that were absent. Bowl & another Chief his son-in-law were down here the ﬁrst time but were at home the second time Lt. Fraser visited their village. The young chief accompanied him to every house and accounted for every one absent hunting 8: present, when he was in the least at a loss for the number absent from any house he went to the next neighbors who counted every one of them to him & after they had ﬁnished com- municated the return to the great Chief Bowl who approved of it & was of opinion they could not exceed that number & by its differing so little from the one he gave me himself before, I have not the slightest doubt of its accuracy. The Return was likewise shewn to one Harsen a respectable Farmer in the neighborhood on an Island occupied by some of the Tribe. This man speaks the language perfectly & is very intimate with the Indians 8: trades with them 8: he thought there could not be half a dozen over or under the number of the return which I enclose and I am conﬁdent is as accurate as any return can possibly be. After all this what opinion are we to form of Mr. Elliott’s Return of 543 in which I am conﬁdent he had an idea we would acquiesce without giving ourselves the least trouble to be better informed & submit to the deception as usual but the deceiver has for once been himself deceived. Upon receiving the two returns ﬁrst men- tioned I could not help viewing this man’s conduct with the utmost indignation & I went immediately to the commissary to forbid him to issue an ounce of provisions on Mr. Elliott’s requisition. already in his possession tho’ signed by myself for want of better information at the time. Being determined not to issue provisions according to Mr. Elliott’s return I sent an Express to Mr. McKee with a letter of which the inclosed is a copy I received his answer likewise inclosed. You .will observe that tho’ Mr. McKee is better acquainted with the number than Mr. Elliott or perhaps any one that is not on the spot, yet he has more prudence in not mentioning any number & referring that to Mr. Elliott who if he chose might easily have had an exact return from this Ohief & some others who were here at the time. Whether Mr. Mc Kee might have been inﬂuenced by knowing that I had a return previous to writing to him or not I cannot pretend to say but I thought his requisition so reasonable that I immediately approved of it and the provisions were to be sent there in a few days under the charge of some trusty person to see it issued. You will 73
Page 578
578 INDIAN AFFAIRS easily observe the great difference between Mr. McKee's‘ lequisition 8:. Mr. Elliotts the'former being only 25 Barrels of Pork 25 of Pease and 50 of Flour whereas the latter at the rate the Indians are victualled here now vizt 3 lbs of Pork & 0 (sometimes 7) lbs of ﬂour per week would in six months amount to 39,000 lbs Pork equal to 187 Barrels and 78,000 lbs of Flour equal to 390 Barrels of 200 lbs each and I’m informed the ration they received at the Chenail Ecarte was still larger than here. The Diﬁerence on the two articles of Pork 8: Flour would be immense. He says in his return these Indians are determined to remain there, from which he must have intended to make us believe they were actually inhabitants & that they were either there at the time, or out a Hunting to return again; neither of which it can be positively proved was the case. Since writing the above I ﬁnd by a Vessel Just returned from Fort Erie that the Indian department have complained against me to Mr. Russel, and asserted the most barefaeed falsehoods which I can easily prove. Tho’ Mr. Russel is likely to have given credit to- them 8: to be alarmed at every triﬁle. I understand that they have said that I on the 14h Ult. on the occasion of an Indian being insulted by a soldier of the Garrison ordered the Troops under arms to intimidate the Indians, that I have permitted several Tap Houses & that I had called a Council of Indians without their knowledge, all which have no foundation in truth as I hope will appear by the papers I have inclosed. The Copy inclosed of the Garrison order of the 28h August will shew that the rum was not sold with my permission. The examination of Mr. Ironside (whom I sent for immediately on receiving this information) before the ofﬁcers of the garrison will shew the falsity of the assertion that any part of the Garrison were under arms excepting the corporal and File of men that were ordered to take the Soldier prisoner for striking the Indian, even the ofﬁcers of the Garrison declared that they had never before heard of the affair untill yesterday & Mr. Reynolds the Commissary heard only ten days afterwards by accident that a soldier had been conﬁned for quarelling with an Indian. So great was the noise they wish to make so much of. Mr. Ironside was the Person who made the complaint to me of the articles being purchased from the Indians & was present when the Indian made his complaint from which I naturally conclude that he must have misrepresented the matter to Mr. Elliott whom I thought would have put more conﬁdence in his information as being on the spot than any other, but however partial, this man could not deviate from the truth 8:. his information did not suit Mr. Elliott. This shows how eagerly they grasp at every triﬂling lCf. ante p. 567. _ . |--’,_uvvj

FROM CAPT. M’LEAN 579 circumstance to make people believe the Indians are injured. In short it may be proved by several witnesses that theme was not the least noise nor discontent, excepting by the Indian who had been struck, who on seeing his complaint attended to immediately 8: the soldier taken prisoner he went of satisfy’d after shaking hands with me tho’ this man who was not within a mile of the Garrison says seriously he cannot answer for the consequences. Nothing can equal so base a conduct 8; this is the way in which they have all along imposed on Government by misrepresentations to answer their own purposes. He has likewise said that I call’d a Counsel of Indians without their con- sent and afterwards gave a Cag of rum to the Indians. I did not call a Council of Indians but I call’d in one Indian (the Chief Bowl) with the prisoner that interpreted as mentioned in a former Letter 8: no more. If they call this a Council I certainly did it but I did right, there was none present but the Chief, the prisoner 8; myself, & the information obtained then (which grieves them sorely) might have otherwise remained in the dark for some time, they have certainly cause to be dissatisfy’d with this as it has brought too much of their Villany to light. It is true I have given the Chief afterwards a Cag of Rum one Gallon Cag &c that Cag may perhaps be the means of saving Government a thousand such Cags. If this be a Crime I acknowledge it, but let them do their worst, I set them at deﬁance. Had I overlooked all their misconduct no crime would have been heard of. I insist upon it that the Indians were never better treated or better satisfy‘d whatever they may say to the contrary. I fear this long letter on so dry a subject will tire His Excellency’s patience. He may however rest assured that no cause of complaint whatever will be given the Indians. The above trit’ﬂing dispute which indeed I imagine was never afterwards thought of, tho’ magnify’d to such a degree, was occasioned by the man’s wife being irritated at being obliged to restore what she had purchased from the Indian, in consequence of which she abused him 8: the Indian offering her some violence was opposed by the husband which gave rise to the Indian’s complaint, but never occasioned the least dissatis- faction among the rest nor was any other in any degree concerned.

' Mr McKee has had more prudence not to mention any number on my application for him for a return tho’ better acquainted with them than the other. in which he has strongly contributed to convict Mr Elliott tho’ probably not intending it. The ditl'erence in the amount of the requisition contributes still more towards it. I have enclosed to Capt Green a Return of these Indians which I am convinced is as accurate as possible. and having written to him so fully on this and every other subject within my observation, that I shall forhear troubling you unnecessarily.

Since writing the above I have received a Letter from Mr Selby Indian Territory, by desire of Mr. McKee, acquainting me that as the Indians of Chenail Ecarte are all going out a Hunting sending Provisions there will not be necessary and even the last requisition may be dispensed with this is exactly according to my own opinion signiﬁed in my Letter to Mr McKee & I cannot account for so sudden a change in his sentiments unless it be in consequence of something received from Head Quarters by this last opportunity. [C 250, p 370] CAPT. HECTOR MC LEAN TO CAPT. JAMES GREEN AMHERSTBURG 1911 Nov. 1797. Sm, The Sloop Francis is just arrived from the Island of St Joseph and to proceed without to Fort Erie with Lieut. Lacy and the Artiﬁcers, tho’ I doubt much from the advanced state of the season that she will be able to return till Spring. I every moment look out for the Return of the Ottawa sailed from hence on the 11h. In my last I mentioned that a requisition had been made by Mr. Elliott for six months provisions for 543 Indians said by him to be determined to remain at the Chenail Ecarte, that afterwards on my writing on the subject to Mr. McKee and giving it as my opinion, that as the Indians were going out a hunting and not to return till Spring, I did not see the necessity of ﬁxing a Depot there for the winter, and that I could not approve of any requisition unless it came from him a small requisition (far short of Mr. Elliotts) only was then made by Mr. McKee, for the reasons assigned in his answer to my letter transmitted with my last, but since then he has all on a sudden changed his mind as appears by the enclosed copy of a Letter from Mr. Selby to Mr. Elliott sent me by the latter, setting forth that as the Indians are all going out a Hunting sending any provisions there for the winter is unnecessary. How the Deputy Superintendent Gen- eral could have been but three days before ignorant of this circum- stance (that the Indians were going out a Hunting) when I knew it perfectly three weeks sooner. is unaccountable to me; tho’ I don’t think their information even on this subject much better than that of many others. _vet I cannot help thinking he must have been acquainted with this circumstance much sooner than he pretends. I am by no means sorry that the Indians should suppose, they were not to be allowed provisions at the Chenail Ecarte during the winter
Page 583
CAPT. M'LEAN TO CAPT. GREEN 583 but cannot say what could have given rise to the supposition. as the smallest hint of it was never given by me tho‘ it is not improbable that these People may lay some stress upon it. The Indians here are perfectly satisfyd received Lt. Fraser with the greatest attention & gave him every possible assistance to procure the return sent. I am conﬁdent that had I acquiesced in Mr. Elliott’s requisition & taken no trouble to enquire into the strength of the Indians at the Chenail Ecarte by sending there &c. that the provisions as per Mr. Elliott’s requisition would have been sent there and expended, a few straggling Indians might have been kept there as a cloak, but when they knew that I was in possession of an accurate return of the Indians and consequently could not be impos'd upon, it would have been too glaring to have taken the provisions there. In short it is impossible to conceive the artiﬁce of these people to obtain their ends, respecting which a thousand reports are handed about here, tho’ positive proof of many of them may be difﬁcult. The Indians being chieﬂy gone out a Hunting the consumption of Provisions must greatly diminish during the winter and the department I think begin to be ashamed of their conduct may likewise contribute to diminish it. The ofﬁcers at the Head of the Department to answer their own private conveniency live at a distance from the Garrison 8: pretend to make us believe that unless they have every thing they chuse at their disposal there, it will be attended with inconvenience to the Indians. But to obviate this inconvenience, let them live at or near the Gar- rison. when the Indians can go immediately from them with the requisitions to be approved by the Commanding ofﬁcer 8: from him to the Kings Store without inconvenience and there can then be no occasion for requisitions for: casual and incidental Issues as they call them. But its a Query whether there be a necessity for the Requisi- tion coming from the Superintendant or even for so many Superin- tendants at all; It has formerly been otherwise but I cannot pretend to say which is the most eligible. I believe however that there was never more abuse than since the present plan. Nothing is more ridic- ulous than to hear them talk of inconvenience to an Indian to go a small distance to get what he wants, when those people move with their whole Families some hundreds of miles to their Hunting Ground and may perhaps hunt for a whole day and sometimes two days to get one Belly full. Previous to listening too much to their proposals 8: demands it might perhaps be well to examine minutely into their motives, lest their own private Interest should be found to preponderate, which I apprehend will too often prove to be the ease.
Page 584
584 INDIAN AFFAIRS I am credibly informed that Mr. Elliott has last Spring received a very considerable quantity of Sugar from the Indians which he appro- priates to his own use, tho’ by the Instructions it ought to have been put into the King’s store, particularly as it is received in return for- the presents & provisions of Government. There are many such circumstances well known here & positively asserted by many, tho’ the proofs may not be so easy. ‘ The Schooner Miamis belonging to Government has been in the possession of the Indian department previous to my arrival at this Post, C-hieﬂy employed during the Summer in fetching grind stones from distant parts of the Lake for Mr. Elliott’s private use, fetching bark for his tannery & carrying wood for Individuals of the depart- ment.

Several attempts have been made from time to time by Mr. Elliott.

His Majesty’s late Instru'ction which vests the management of the Indian concerns in Upper Canada in the Person administering the government of that Province, was no sooner made known than the greatest Irregularities were attempted by the ofﬁcers of the Indian Department, who seemed to think themselves relieved from all control, and particularly by Mr Elliott in direct violation of the Regulations established by Lord Dorchester, and which I have continued to enforce being convinced that they are highly judicious & necessary. It is but justice to Capt McLean of the R. C. V. who commands at Amherstburg. to mention that be ﬁrmly resisted the attempts which were made to obtain extraordinary Issues of Provisions upon false Returns of Indians and also that he has not failed to represent such other irregularities as have come to his knowledge, a very lengthy cor- respondence has taken place on this occasion, but I did not conceive it necessary to trouble your Grace with the particulars of it. especially as Captain Mayne of the Queen’s Rangers who is now in England can if your Grace should desire it. give you very full Information respect- ing these transactions.

I have now to acquaint you for the Commander in Ohiefs Informa- tion that Mr Caldwell has got the contract for furnishing Government with Teams for the current year at the rate of nineteen Shillings New York Currency (about 12 Hal.) each single Team per day. The former being the lowest proposal for Teams and the Latter the only one made for the Firewood. Mr Caldwell would have undertaken to furnish the Government with Firewood from his own Land at 1558 Halifax per
Page 591
CAPT. M’LEAN TO CAPT. GREEN 591 Cord. but I preferred having it furnished from the Garrison ground at half a dollar less untill the Commander in Chief’s pleasure is known. Indeed if the strength of the Troops admitted of their being employed to cut the ﬁrewood it might be procured at half the price, as the King’s horses cou’d haul a great part of it. The same objection that existed at Detroit of the Troops being too much harrassed in fetching the garrison ﬁrewood on Batteaux having no weight here particularly while it can be furnished so near at hand on the Govt ground, in the same manner as part of the wood was provided last year at Kingston at an easy rate. So much land in the vicinity of this post having been granted to individuals 8: reserved for Indians 8: their Oﬂicers that the Garrison ground is consequently rather circumscribed 8: can- not furnish ﬁrewood for many years. The Policy of the Govt. of this Province of granting large tracts of Land to Individuals not capable of improving 8: probably not entitled to them has evidently been injurious to the Country in general. It is even said that the Indian Reserve of 7 miles square near this Garrison is now claimed by an Individual. I have agreeable to His Excellency’s desire signiﬁed to me in your Letter of the 19h Oct. last given notice that Lotts should be granted near this Garrison to build upon on the ground allotted for that pur- pose, and have already had more applications than there are Lotts from Merchants & others, chieﬂy Mechanicks—I have as yet granted none but have given them to understand that a consideration should be annexed that unless a habitable house should be erected on the Lott before the expiration of a twelve months, it reverts to the Crown They seem satisfyed with this condition and I have no doubt but the whole of the Lotts will be occupied within that Period. Should the weather prove favourable the cutting and hauling of the Ship Timber will be compleated in a Fortnight. The Indians have made no difﬁculty in permitting the Timber to be cut on the Reserve without exacting a present, at least they have said nothing on the sub- ject, indeed there are only four or ﬁve Families of Men. The Indian Stores have been removed on the 20h Ulto. into the Garrison to an apartment purchased for that purpose in the new store where there is sufﬁcient room & Mr. Elliott has been told that the rent of his store was to cease. The Superintendant & Storekeeper at this Post have come to me voluntarily to make the required apologies for their conduct last Sum- mer 8: seem more submissive in consequence of the notice taken of their behaviour by His Excellency.

There is a Blacksmith for the Indian Dept. paid by Govt. & allowed Fuel & Lodging equal to a Subaltern ofﬁcer he was within a few miles of this place 8: I am informed has very little to do for Indians, I would therefore recommend that he should reside at this Post & when not occupied in that Line be kept constantly employed doing the necessary work of the Garrison which will probably save the Expence of having another Blacksmith with the assistance of a Labourer from the Troops.

I received your favor of'the 29h March as also the enclosed extract from the President, by which it seems His Honor would wish to have a further explanation with respect to the atfairs of the Canada Indians or Caughnawagas. It is now going on three years since we ﬁrst heard of it, they then sent us some strings of wampum to inform us that they would no more attend any Council to the Westward but that they would remain at home and take care of their own Lands, lying to the north of the river St. Lawrence, as also up the Grand River (that is on the road to Michilimackinac) for that sometimes they unexpect- edly found White People seated on their Lands & that also we the Mohawks had disposed of some which they must see about. but we thought no more of it then, thinking they had spoke inconsiderately & being conscious ourselves of never having sold any land bélonging to them, expected they would drop it. afterwards when they had a meet- ing with the Commissioner from New York State they pretended to have got full information of the Spot they accuse us of selling. and the “'riting with the Signatures of the Sellers annexed to it. last winter when I was in the States I made no inquiry about it. imagining it would be settled at a meeting we agreed to hold with them at Buf- faloe Creek. where their complaint would be examined into. but instead of coming there at the time we expected last Summer. they went to the Oneidas to gain them to their Interest and were plotting against me. and since that they seem to get more and more severe. threatening to strike if we do not give them the money, which as we have not to
Page 600
600 INDIAN AFFAIRS give, they must certainly follow the bent of their Inclinations, they furthermore say that the Mackinac Indians are ready to join them and that there is an Ottawa Chief from that place that they call White Eyes waiting to hear the event at the Lake of the Two Mountains. I rather expect they are expecting the arrival of the French to begin. They will never give us the satisfaction to tell us the Spot of land they disputed notwithstanding they continually say they have the Paper that is a Proof of it ’til the winter the men we sent down insisted on getting a copy of it to bring up and we ﬁnd it to be the 'Genosee Lands that were sold by the Senecas to Oliver Phelps Esquire and to which we nor they have any Claim. Thinking this accusation to be only a pretence and that they are waiting the arrival of the French to strike, I wish to push the matter and bring it to a point one way or another, that is that they either confess themselves in the wrong for accusing us falsely or prove their accusation, or attack us at once before they have any better opportun- ity, & I wish Government would interfere to bring this about, as for instance, whenever we have requested them to come to our Council at Buffaloe Creek to inquire into the affair. they will not, but request as to go to New York. therefore we wish that they would speak to them that they might be more plain with us. and come to our Council Fire and explain the matter. I saw lately in an Albany paper that four Caughnawagas had passed there on their way to Philadelphia to see the President of the United States but I rather suppose they are gone to see the French Ambassador and Consult with him, as the Americans dont care much for such visitors unless they have some interest in it, hope you will excuse the tediousness of my letter as I could not give a full account of the Business 8: be more brief.

Page 602
60‘2 INDIAN AFFAIRS The consumption of Provisions to Indians during the winter has been very triﬂing. as they remain chieﬂy at their hunting grounds. but now they begin to come in and all receive a few days provisions while here. to carry them to their respective homes, together with such other little articles as they may be most in want of—They are perfectly satisfy‘d and seem sensible of the Liberality of Government towards them—any thing said to the contrary since I have been here must have entire proceeded from Interested views. “’ith respect to Mr Elliott’s dismissal I think it cannot fail to be attended with the very best consequences, in this part of the Country & a warning to others—The good effects of it are already visible every thing being done with great regularity. and as to the Indians I hardly think they have considered it of consequence enough to bestow a thought upon it. A quantity of sugar has already been received here from the Indians and put into the King's store, being I believe the ﬁrst donation of the kind received at this Post none having been received during Mr Elliott’s Superintendance and he not ﬁnding it so convenient to take it from them this year as usual— My promised reinforcement from Fort George I daily expect & there being some spare room in the Ordnance Block House I have directed the Engineers to convert it into quarters for more Troops of which there will be an estimate transmitted by next opportunity. I have directed the Barrack Master to transmit returns of the Bar- racks agreeable to the Regulations. The Blacksmith engaged last Fall has been since employed & does all the work both for the Marine 8: Engineer Departments his name is Francois Bertran. The Schooner Miamis is agreeable to Excellencies desire received into the Marine Dept. Inclosed is a Report of Survey held on that Vessel—I likewise enclose a report of Survey on a quantity of Mapple Sugar sent down last fall from St Joseph by Capt. Drummond. A room is already prepared in the new store for holding Indian (‘orn in Bulk of which an Estimate will be transmitted. There is I believe a sufﬁcient quantity of Timber cut for building the intended Vessel; what part of it was cut here has been hauled during the winter and the remainder being all cedar which was cut on the Islands by the Ottawa’s Crew in the winter, I expect to have here in a couple of Days. Capt. Grant having gone to fetch it with three Vessels (the Ottawa, )Iaria & Miamisl in order to have it over before the hurry of the transport begins. The Francis having wintered at Fort Eric is not yet arrived. when she does. it will be necessary that

All the Lotts on the Plan1 sent up are already given away almost all to Merchants, there are a number of other applicants good subjects & chieﬂy merchants which might probably be an useful acquisition at the Post. I shall therefore be glad to know whether another street might not be laid out back, for these People or as much land as will be suﬂicient to settle them in the same proportion as the ﬁrst.

The object of His Majestys late Instructions relative to the Indian Department in Upper Canada were particularly framed with a view of rendering the otiicers in that Department more immediately & directly responsible for their conduct to the Executive Authority in that Province & for the purpose of enforcing a system of the strictest reg— ularity & economy in the discharge of the several services connected with that Dept. Mr. Elliott’s dismissal from his oﬁice of Superintendant of Indians at Detroit now Amherstburg appears to have been highly necessary. Unfortunater for His Majesty’s Service & for that particu- lar branch of it now under consideration Major Fraser died some months ago in the West Indies. I trust that the duties of Mr. Elliott’s situation will be sufﬁciently attended to for the present & I shall myself take the earliest opportunity of receiving His Majesty's Pleasure as to the appointment of a proper person to succeed him.

JOHN NAIRNE AND MALCOLM FRASER T0 PETER STUARTS 607 JOHN NAIRNE .xxn MALCOLM FRASER TO PETER STUARTS MURRAY BAY‘ DEAR Sm. 14h June 1798. Major Fraser wrote you a few lines two days ago in a hurry acquainting you that there was a number of Mickmack Indians arrived here and there are some more arrived since who are very insolent so much so that when Colonel Nairne spoke to some of them yesterday and told them to go off to their own country (as the governor had ordered and they promised to do and not return last year when Mr. Delisle was sent down for that purpose) instead of hearkening to Col. Nairne they called out Boh! Bob! and pushed on with their Canoes up the Malbay River, and several Cabin’s full of Indians are now at Point au Pic.2 Col. Nairne & Major Fraser would immediately endeavour to call out the Militia and force them to decamp but we are loath to go to extremities till we have the General’s orders in waiting to do so, and at the same time a party of troops was it no more than a serjeants com- mand to be stationed at Tadonsae could be sent down along with such orders we are certain that we could drive them off But it is absolutely necessary that we be authorized to do so by the General and if Mr. Delisle or some person who understands their language could be sent down so much the better and there must be a special order for the Militia to assist as without that they cannot be called out they having no inclination to drive off the Indians unless absolutely ordered by the General to do so. Indeed we are sorry to say that most of them had much rather that those Savages should continue to haunt hereabouts as by that means they (the Canadians) could traﬂick with them for furs & other articles to the great detriment of the King’s Posts and much to the hurt and disadvantage of every well disposed subject who is desirous to obey orders & support Government. We expect your answer as soon as possible 8.: are ' ~ D“ Sir Your most obedt. Servants JOHN NAIRNE MALCOLM FRASER. If the General chuses to give any orders regarding those Savages it will be best to have them addressed to Co]. Nairne as commander of the Militia below Cap.

60$ INDIAN AFFAIRS CAPT. HECTOR MC LEAN TO CAPT. JAMES GREEN AMHERSTBL’RG Sm. 19h June 1798. I have received on the 11th Instant your Letters dated the 30h April and 10h of May with their inclosures. Lieut Backwell of the Royal Engineers arrived here the same day and has taken the direction of the Engineer Department in the place of Lieut Cooper who returns to Lower Canada by this opportunity. His Excellency may rest assured that Lt. Backwell shall be furnished with every possible assistance from the Garrison that our strength can admit & which the reinforcement lately arrived will the better enable me to give; tho” even before the Service could not have been retarded for want of men, as I believe few (if any) requisitions have been made that were not granted to the full extent, tho’ it must he confessed it fell harder on the Troops. The proportion of Tools to be sent as a deposit for the Engineer's Dept. is a most necessary measure which it is to be lamented was not sooner adopted to have saved the enormous Expence of purchasing these articles here, few as they have been since my command of this Post it was always with reluctance I considered myself obliged to sanction such extravagant purchases with my signature. I cannot suppose the Purchaser (Mr. Reynolds as Storekeeper) has any interest in such purchases. I am however conﬁdent that every article procured in this manner for Government is charged by the Merchants at a more extravagant rate than if the same articles were sold to individuals tho’ purchased probably in larger quantities. I have been told that a preference has likewise been given to certain Merchantile Houses without regard to the price this ought not & shall not take place to my knowledge. No part of the Articles in the State- ment enclosed in your letter of the 1st May being purchased during my command or sanctioned by my authority excepting the Oil 8: Paint for the Fire Engine, which I presume will appear to have been abso- lutely necessary; I cannot decide on the necessity there but must beg leave to refer to the enclos’d explanation given by Mr. Reynolds. His Excellencies directions to report the circumstance previous to the purchase of any Articles of Stores. are extremely proper 8: shall be punctually observed. A Survey of all the Tools at the Post shall be ordered without delay and an accurate statement made of the same. Inclosed I send a return of the Barrack bedding utensils &c. at this

Sloop Francis sailed on the 16h Inst. for the Island of St. Joseph with Mr. McKee Mr. Selby & a Mr. (Richard) Pollard Commis- sioners 0n the part of Government to negotiate the purchase of said Island from the Indians—they have taken the whole of the goods esti- mated at £1,200 apparently in good condition for said purchase. Provi- sions have likewise been forwarded & Corn for the Indians. so that one more trip will be sufﬁcient to convey to that Post every article that may be required for this Season. The Engineer having represented to me the necessity of having the Powder Magazine at this Post immediately compleated. and-there not being a sufﬁciency of Sheet Iron in Store to cover it I have detained a. Box intended for the Island of St. Joseph upon the supposition there can be no such immediate necessity for that article there 8: that it may be replaced from below before it can be wanted for Stove pipes. Upon the dismiml of Mr. Elliott Mr. McKee1 directed his son Capt. McKee of the 60h Regiment to do the duty of Superintendant at this Post. he has accordingly done that duty since; but his appointment in that capacity here having never been notify’d to me from Head Quar- ters. I am in doubt with respect to the regularity of receiving him as such merely on the authority of Mr. McKee. particularly as I was given to understand by the Military Secretary’s Letter of the 19h January that the Indians were to be attended to by Mr. McKee him- self. The issues of presents & provisions to Indians are now perfectly regular to the Instructions. and the officers of the Department. brought to more order and a better sense of their duty, the_ presents & pro- visions being now delivered to the Indians personally present only, in presence of the ofﬁcers and the requisition produced; but they still take care to keep up the consumption by inviting all the Indians from the most distant quarters to receive presents and provisions in such quantities as astonishes every body; even the Indians themselves express their astonishment at the change. Without some such extraordinary means, their Superintendants know it would be impossible to consume the Stores as formerly, when they had things entirely at their own disposal and the Indians did not receive a quarter of what is given them now. At that time the Indians were rather discouraged from coming in to receive anything, and when 1Capt. Thomas McKee of the 60th, who married Theresa. daughter of Col. John Askin.

The Indians settled on the American side who can have no such claim as those said to be driven from their homes during the Indian war are invited to this garrison and requisitions made on Different pretences for a months provisions at a time, which provisions I am credibly informed they afterwards sell to merchants at Detroit. The abuses in this Department have been so great and of so long a standing that a compleat reform cannot all at once be expected, and it would perhaps not be good policy to attempt on a sudden what by degrees may easily be affected. Mr. McKee on my signifying to him the Commander in Chief’s orders for the removal of the Indian Blacksmith to this Post promised to comply immediately but requtsted permission for his remaining a few days on pretence of repairing some arms & this being granted he will soon be sent down. They have four King’s Batteaux belonging to this Post in their possession employ’d for their own private use, chieﬂy in carrying wood, Lime, Stones and Mortar for new buildings. They had possession of them previous to my arrival. I have directed them to be delivered up to the Storekeeper in charge. It is not yet done & I have reason to think that at least some of them are rendered unser- viceable as these people were always in the habit of getting whatever they asked for & were never obliged to render any account of what they received belonging to Govt. The indulgence they received in every particular was astonishing. In looking over Estimates at this Post I ﬁnd one amounting to £53 98 11d approved by Capt. Mayne, for materials to repair the ﬂat bottomed schooner Miamis in April 1797. This surprises me the more from her being constantly in private employ since, until lately received in the Marine Department. It is asserted with conﬁdence by some of the most respectable gentlemen in this vicinity that there was a Barter account between the Indian Dept and a certain Merchantile House here from which all their chief ofﬁcers received everything requisite for their private use during the year at the expiration of which this account, in which was included the pay of Interpreters (whom they paid by orders on the merchts) was cancelled by delivering goods out of the Indian Store in Payment I have no affidavit of this but the authority of Gentlemen 8: merchants not interested is hardly to be doubted. I will not be positive that substantial proof of this circumstance coud be produced. I think it however sufﬁcient to point out the necessity of watching these people with a vigilant 8: zealous Eye. It may likewise be a question worth examining whether it be good policy to have the Father 8: Son Super- intendants in the same district and the latter entirely under the

The latter was appointed I believe for Michillimackinac a separate district where he would have been totally independant of the other. I think it but Justice to say that the Storekeeper Ironside (who as well as Mc Kee himself was a good deal alarmed at the dismimal of Elliott) is now remarkably attentive to every part of his duty and does not scruple to acknowledge that he was always made to understand that he was subject only to the orders of his Superiors in the Depart- ment, but as he now thinks himself rather more independant of them as a Storekeeper ought to be, and indeed they ought to be of each other, he is not afraid to declare his real Sentiments.

The only articles of such a description that I am now possessed of are three Petrifactions found last winter in a cave in one of the Islands in Lake Erie, where the Ottawa was laid up during that season; I have sent them in charge of Lt Cooper in a box directed to you, and if you think them worthy of a place amongst Mrs Prescott's collection, they may be presented to her.

It is true I have had a good deal of trouble llere to which the Ind. Dept. have contributed but I think matters are likely to take a more favourable turn. While Mr McK is at the head of Ind.

They have made a requisition for rum but there being little to spare in Store here, and the consumption of that article appearing to be greater in proportion at St Joseph than at this Post we have sent them none. The presents for this year's supply for this place in charge of Con- ductor Walker are at Fort Erie and to come up by the return of the Ottawa when the conductor will be discharged. I now enclose a return taken of the Indians at the Settlement of the Chenail Ecarte (including those lately Joined from Sagana to 24th June last amounting in number to 201) Persons that are regularly victualled there. exclusive of the Little Chief Otters Tribe 40 Persons moved from the Chenail Ecarte & settled behind Sandwich as- appears by the memorandum I have annexed to the return.

If instead of constantly victualling so many of their young able bodied men, their women, children, aged 8: inﬁrm were only victualled it would I conceive have a better eﬂ’ect as by this means the young people would be obliged to exert themselves more and as they would be well received & victualled when they called by chance or came for their annual presents it would not affect their Loyalty. They give the Indians very little of any thing at the American Gar- rison of Detroit, never more than two or three days provision at a time, 8: seldom even that. Tho’ Mr. McKee informed me that the Indian Blacksmith was to come down to the Garrison when he had ﬁnished a few arms he had to repair he is not yet come, 8:, I am informed that as it does not suit his conveniency so well as remaining on his Farm & working for the whole Country, when not employed for Mr. McKee & the rest of the Department he means to resign, which I apprehend can at present be attended with very little inconvenience to Govt. 8: I imagine another may easily be had at the same rate, or even if he had half as much again 8: be employed in the Garrison, Govt. would gain consid- erably by it, as it is an undoubted fact that this man was almost constantly employed for themselves & seldom did anything for Indians. I have in a former Letter mentioned my having long since rejected their requisitions for casual & incidental issues but to remove the pretence of inconvenience to Govt. Mr. Elliott the late Supt. was told the Indians might have bread at the Garrison Bakery on his requisition to be delivered to themselves only. But instead of this he sent his own servants constantly for large quantities of bread without dis- tinguishing between the tickets for Indians 8: those for his own use. I refused to pay the Baker or to admit them as a charge agt. Govern- ment. The Baker consequently prosecuted Mr. E. 8: obtained a ver- dict against him. The only plea he would make was, that it was a custom for Govt. to issue Flour for such tickets as he sent to the Baker merely in his own name, 8: a most shameful custom it was. not much to the credit of those who countenanced it, that a whole family consisting sometimes of between 40 & 50 persons should have been maintained for a length of time as Indians. When he could get no more bread for himself & people in that way he took none for Indians who have since always received ﬂour.

After having used the box of sheet iron intended for the Island of St. Joseph spoken of in my last, we are still deﬁcient sixty sheets of Iron for covering the Powder Magazine, but as the Engineer seems to think that this can be no obstacle to removing the Powder when the magazine is sufﬁciently dry and otherwise ready, I shall postpone the purchase of it in expectation of receiving some soon from below. The Engineer complains very justly that the timber for carrying on the different works not being provided in time necessity obliges him to use it immediately quite green and unseasoned. which renders it the more difﬁcult to work and the work itself not so well executed. We have been under the necessity to provide a great deal of timber to execute estimates form’d and approvld at Quebec, and there being no pine Timber nearer than about sixty or seventy miles of this place, furnished only by the House of Meldrum & Park of detroit. for want of completion the price is kept up pretty high as is indeed the price Of every thing by contract here.

Your Letters of the 1611 and 225d August and tho it was impossible to send ott' a vessel for St Joseph so early as the Commander in Chief wished, yet the Francis has been this day dispatched for that Island to take down Lieut Landmann and the two Military Artiﬁcers Capt Grant thinking it not too late. Having returned from Fort Erie the 10h & having sustained some damage in her sails and rigging it was impossible to compleat these repaiis So as to get her in readiness before this day, but as she went there last year for Lieut Lacey exactly about the same time and returned early enough to go to Fort Erie I’m in hopes she may do the same this year. The Ottawa under the command of Lieut Cowan2 on her passage to this Post has been driven back in a gale of wind to Fort Erie and forced from thence with the loss of an anchor down the Rapids. but I am informed has sustained no damage. She is not yet arrived, but we expect her every moment, when she comes there will be nothing left at Fort Erie to forward nor have we an account of anything being on the way. tho’ it is probable there may be rum as there is none either at this Post or St. Joseph, not even for the seamen, for whom alone it is wanted here. As for the Indians when they know that there is none in store, they never ask for any. nor do they give us the small- est trouble. There has not been a drop of Rum issued to an Indian out of the King’s Store here for upwards of a month, 8: on being told that there was none they gave themselves no concern about it nor gave ‘See appendix. 2Capt.

His Excellency may rest assured that every attention will be paid to them, and that there will be no cause for discontent, they are per- fectly satisﬁed & the ofﬁcer Capt (Me Kee) who has the direction of them here appears to have the Kings interest at heart & to be perfectly reasonable 8: totally disinterested if left to himself & not under the inﬂuence of his father things I believe here go on very well. As often as the Indian Dept wished it it appeared necessary the hour of one O’Clock ﬁxed by the Garrison Order for the delivery of requisitions_to Indians has always been wav’d particularly when the Indians arrived very hungry from a distance or signiﬁed a wish to depart without delay in which case they have been frequently told that they are to be served immediately and their oﬂicers perfectly know it & I believe there has been no cause of complaint on that score, if however I ﬁnd the least, or that it should appear to encrease the expense (which I am not sensible it does) it shall be immediately done away. A few chiefs of dilTerent Nations, about six in number are gone to Philadelphia with a Mr Shietﬂin an American Superintendent in con- sequenee of an invitation I understand from Congress to hold a confer- ence.

The greater part of the above diminution in the Issues I conceive arises from the stoppage put to the requisitions for casual & incidental issues particularly the article of Rum, and it is beyond a doubt that the Indians have notwithstanding received a great deal more this year than last year, unless we accept the pernicious & unnecessary article of Rum alone. H. McLEAN. [o 251, p 267] INFORMATION RELATIVE TO DETROIT BY AN INDIAN FORT GEORGE 31st January 1799. Information given by a \Vestern Indian who returned from Detroit the 30h instant, where he had been sent for the purpose of getting intelligence of what the Indians to the Westward were doing. I left the Grand River Christmas day by desire of Captain Brant, who told me it was the President’s wish that some person should visit the Indians about Detroit, and endeavour to learn how they stood affected towards the British Government as there was a ﬂying report that the French and Spaniards were busy in trying to prejudice and induce them to act against the King their Father. I got to Detroit in nine days and stayed at a Shawenee Chiefs House on the British Side of the River near which was an Ottawa Chiefs encampment, who asked me to come and see him, as he had some Rum and intended to have a dance, when I went I found there were about thirty of that Nation with him. It was at that time this Ottawa Chief (the Otter) took out a large Belt of White Wampum I took it to be eight inches wide, and upwards of three feet long this Belt he said was sent from the Caughnawagas
Page 628
628 INDIAN AFFAIRS by a party consisting of twenty Ottawas, who were at the Caughnawaga Village in Lower Canada last Summer, he then said this was the purport of it. That there were about four thousand Indians friends to the Spaniards met in a Body at the mouth of the Mississipi who were to begin their march in four months time to meet the Indians to the Westward at IVhite River and this is what they. say—If you meet us at the White River according to our request we shall consider you as friends—but if not take care and go out of the way—for we have a big Stick and a Broad Foot and in case you interfere with our plans or designs we will knock you down and tread you under foot. At the time the Otter told this he said there was one month and ﬁve days of the four months past and that is now twenty days ago. He also said that the Belt was called a Tomahawk and in case the Indians above mentioned did not come on as was expected then the Tomahawk was to lay still. On may way from Detroit I saw Big John a Munsee Chief on the River la Franche (Tranche) at the Munsee Village, who was sent from the Miami to induce them to set off for the White River as soon as they heard the Spaniards had begun their march, in order to meet them there —tha.t they had all concluded to go except nine Houses, who in case of any disturbance intended to leave the River la Franche and come 'to the grand River. The Shawenoes seem to be ﬁrmly attached to government. I certify the above to be a true Statement as delivered by the young Indian.

Page 632
632 INDIAN AFFAIRS that the annual presents should be sent out to them, and delivered at a distance from the Garrison, and I from the same motives perfectly conceeded them in that opinion, but on more mature deliberation since, I ﬁnd this measure liable to many objections, which may probably require that previous to its being adopted. it should be weighed with due attention, lest it might tend to defeat the object we had in view (and indeed partly effected) by admitting things again into the same channel. By removing the delivery Of presents and provisions to Indians to a distance from the Garrison & entirely from the view & control of per- sons totally disinterested, whose duty it must be to check any irregu~ larity and abuse, to be subject to the management of persons, such as issuers 8: Interpreters whose chief aim it has always been to keep us ignorant and to make a mystery of everything relating to the depart- ment and who cannot be supposed equally disinterested nor actuated by the. same liberal motives; I say by doing this we may probably open a wide door for abuse, which tho’ it may not be immediately per- ceived, will gain ground by degrees untill it arrives at such a height as may render any remedy or reform difﬁcult and as we have already in some degree felt the good effects of the late arrangement, when they have scarcely had time to operate might it not be good policy to wait the further operation of them, previous to adopting a system that might perhaps frustrate all our views. “'0 are certain that the con- sumption of the stores at least the provisions is now less tho’ the Indians receive more than formerly, we are likewise certain that they now receive everything issued for them out of the King’s Store. We see their numbers and we know that no other person has any interest whatevier in the issues, but can we be equally certain of this at a. dis- tance from our view? even admitting that a few young inexperienced oﬁicers who are seldom particular 8: unacquainted with the tendency of things, should be sent to see the presents delivered, and as it will be impossible to know the number of the Indians that may come to the place appointed, by what rule are we to be guided in making out the requisition, particularly of the provisions sent, I must observe that it is not the coming in of the Indians to receive their annual presents that occasions such an enormous consumption of provisions, but the frequency of their visits at other times encouraged by the liberal Donations given them each time independant of what is called the annual present. which last will of itself be attended with the same expense in provisions, in the ﬁrst instance. whether they receive it here or at a distance, as they expect to be victualled at the time. but
Page 633
CAPT. M'LEAN TO SIR JOHN JOHNSON 633 it will make a very material difference in other respects by the great additional expense arrising from the transportation of the presents and provisions to a distance, an additional number of issuers and Inter- preters (as you cannot prevent the Indians coming likewise to the Garrison at the same time & which they must do in passing 8; repass- ing) and probably storehouses for the security of the goods which must be kept waiting for them for a length of time as it cannot be expected that the numerous bands from so many ditferent quarters at a great distance can arrive in a. short period of time, as they may do in the vicinity of Posts where their'numbers are but few and the dis- tance short. \Ve can now judge of their wants and see whether they make a good or a bad use of the Government Bounty which circumstance with many others necessary to be known. certain persons might probably ﬁnd it to their interest to conceal. I am sensible that however liberal the annual present many of the Industrious part of the Indians at a great distance will not think it a sufﬁcient recompense for trouble & loss of time in coming for it every year 8: if they dont come. the saving ought to be to Government. But Query is it good Policy to encourage Indians from a great distance inhabiting the territory of another Nation by such expensive presents 8: is it likely that even this will attach them to us in case of war. contrary to their own Interests which must sutfer in a considerable degree by quitting their present country that abounds in game to come to our side, where the hunting bears no comparison. or even if this did attach them to us would their allegiance or their services be a sufﬁcient counterpoise for the very great expence that must ensue from the support that they will expect. But to return to the point in Question, it must be admitted that the chief cause of the present great consumption is the frequency of their visits to the Garrison. and the - requisitions always made for them when they come without any regard to the annual present and will our sending the presents to be delivered at a distance prevent these visits. I think not but on the contrary it will increase them, as we cannot with propriety deliver the presents on the American territory and the only places now in our possession where they coud with conveniency be delivered are the River La Franche and the Chenail Ecarté. and the most of the Indians would call at the Garrison in going to 8: returning & expect something (according to the present system) at both times. The only eﬁ’ectual and in my opinion very easy way of reducing the present great consumption is to impress strongly on the minds of the
Page 634
634 INDIAN AFFAIRS Indians that as they receive an ample supply of cloathing ammunition tobacco ornaments &c once a year they are to expect no more for that year (except in case of distress) but to provide for themselves untill the return of the next year, and if they should come to give them nothing which will prevent their coming again untill the time for receiving their annual present. The ammunition they receive annually will enable them in the ﬁrst instance to provide for themselves with game, the produce of which if industrious will be sufﬁcient to replace that ammunition when expended. instead of being encouraged to come to the Post for a few pounds of that, and many other articles with which their own industry may very amply supply them. This is the lnode I would recommend, and which I wish to pursue untill it is for- bid or unless it would appear that it can have any ill tendency This will doubtless tend to diminish the consumption of provisions and Rum. and appears to be agreeable to the spirit of the General Regu- lations, but without the Quantum of the annual present is specify’d and clearly ascertained it may not have any considerable elfect upon the other stores, but as we perfectly know what the Indians commonly wear and what they require most. it cannot be difﬁcult to determine at what the annual present ought to be ﬁxed. for men, women & children; at least a general rule might be laid down. with exceptions when cir- cumstances require it. and when chiefs and meritorious warriors are concerned. I conceive that tho’ it may be good policy to attend to the necessities of the Indians, to receive them well when they call by chance. and to aid them always when in distress. yet that too frequent visits ought not to be encouraged. and it is much better that they should not come at all than to refuse them when they do come. I am likewise of opinion that all their whims and unreasonable desires ought not to be so much attended to as hitherto, when the best reason that coud often be assigned for giving them any unnecessary article was, that they ask‘d for it. If all the Curiosities and Luxuries that human art can invent were deposited in the Indian Store and that they saw them, they would ask for them, but it does not follow that they are necessary or that they ought to be gratify‘d. They may indeed address us emphatically with the term Father, as they artfully do for we certainly humor them like little children in all their unreasonable requests. many of which if rum is withheld may be denied them. and indeed frequently are of late without any perceptible difference. If only a Belly full is given them when they visit the Post & no ruin their visits will not be so frequent. giving them more is indeed of

The Americans give them hardly anything, and as they show no dis- position to detach them from our interest. by more liberal sup plies what is there to require so great a profusion on our part.

DEAR Sm, I arrived here on Thursday evening last. with Sir John Johnson. at which you will readily conceive I was very glad. for I assure you that
Page 636
636 INDIAN AFFAIRS we have had a very fatiguing Journey. both in going and returning, we left Amherstburg (where we arrived the Sh April) the 22d by the route of River Thames & got to Fort George the 3d May, where we were detained untill the 26h for a passage, the ﬁrst arrival there from Kingston was on the 1811 and when we left it the ice was running down the river in large bodies and was quite fast for six miles above Fort Erie. indeed the season has been more backward than was ever known in that country and I ﬁnd that it is not farther advanced here, it was Sir John’s intention to have went to York on his return but the wind not being favorable we came to Kingston direct. We saw very few of the Western Indians up the country owing to their not having returned from hunting, those that we did see at Amherstburg were a few of the principal Chiefs of the Shawanese and Huron tribes, most of the indians of Grand river where at home & recd us very hand- somely, Captain Brant with a considerable party of the ﬁve Nations will soon be down to transact some business with the Seven Nations. Nothing very interesting took place during our stay with them. I conclude that Sir John will report by this days post what passed— that the reports which occasioned his going up the Country were false, and raised by some persons to answer private views I believe there cannot be the least doubt of, it remains to be traced, it thought neces- sary, and I do not conceive it to be impracticable. The inclosed letter is from my brother1 and I sincerely hope it may meet with a. favorable answer, altho’ his request is not supported by any particular recommendation. I think that common justice entitles him to expect some notice to be taken of his situation in the present state of matters. for the truth of what is stated in his letter I can vouch for and I am sure that Mr. Coﬁin well knows the same, he relies greatly on your goodness and intercession which as far as can be aﬂ’orded I am conﬁdent you will use to serve him, which will add to the many obligations that the family are already under to you, and of which they are highly sensible and will ever acknowledge with the sincerest gratitude. Capt. Hugh McDonell has applied to the President for the same appointment, what encouragement he has received I do not know. Perhaps a Memorial to His Excellency would have been more proper. however I cannot think that it could make any material _diﬂ’erence. in addition to what my brother says respecting his having the whole business of the Post to do for six months after Colonel 1William Johnson Chew.

I have now to inform you he has carried his plan into etfect; and it is my duty to send you the earliest information thereof that I may not incur blame from any consequences that may result from this extra- ordinary deviation from a system which has been pursued here ever since Pontiacs War and probably in a partial degree long before it. The Indians who have been sent from this part with only a days provisions or a little more have expressed to me great dissatisfaction which will no doubt be speedily communicated throughout their Nations; and it is to be feared that this breach of so old a custom may greatly operate to the diminution, if not the total extinction of our inﬂuence and may inﬁnitely prejudice His Majesty’s Indian Inter- est in these parts. It would undoubtedly be a great ease to me in the prosecution of my duty if the Indians were not allowed a single Ration. and the Commandant has the power of Judging of the expediency of giving or withholding not only provisions but presents at his pleasure, the oﬂice of snperintendant does not under these circumstances appear calculated either to preserve our inﬂuence or to conciliate the esteem and friend- ship of the Indian Nations.

' Brothers the Five Nations We are happy to see you here well at this Council Fire of the Seven Nations, we give thanks to the Almighty that he has been pleased to preserve you from accidents along the road, so that we now have the satisfaction of seeing you safe arrived at this our Council Fire of the Seven Nations, as it would have entirely deprived us of the joy we now feel at seeing our Brethren, had any accident happened to them on their journey toward us; The road which our ancestors had made for our Brethren to walk in, on the business of peace. has got encumbered with many fallen Trees, and bushes have grown up therein so as to make it almost imperceptible. we are therefore happy that you have now beat the path again so as to make it plain. Brothers, On every turn along the road there is birds telling Stories. our ancestors ordered that such things should not be listened to, but be cast behind our backs, let us therefore Brethren do as our Forefathers commanded. Brothers, As you are but just come of your journey and must be tired, we shall defer opening the business for which we have called you to our Council Fire, untill you have sufficiently reposed yourselves, so we now close the Council. Then one of the Oneidas from Oneida got up and spoke Brothers I have a few words to speak to you on the part of the Chiefs at
Page 644
644 INDIAN AFFAIRS Oneida they have been convincing the Story-telling Birds. which have been saying that the Oneidas had best not attend the Council at Caughuawaga as they had been on the American side during the late war, that they would certainly meet with bad treatment if they went there. I was'therefore Brothers desired by the Chiefs of the Oneidas to ask you. how that is. if it is so or not. the bird was heard at several places and wanted to stop us from coming here. and his name is Col. Louis. The Chief of the Caughnawagas then said that it might have origin- ' ated at St. Regis but that he hoped his brothers the Oneidas would pay no attention to it for that he would assure them that they had no harm to expect from the Seven Nations. Then a Chief Capt. John from St. Regis said. be supposed it would again be said that this report came from St. Regis, tho’ the Chiefs there know nothing about it. nor any one except it might be Louis and his party. and that he regretted and was ashamed that the Chiefs of the Seven Nations had listened so much to that man as they had all done, except himself, that was the cause of the present assembly being now called together. and of various other trouble they had been at on that account and that he now heard he would not be present at this meeting. Speech of the Canaughnawags, 8th July Brother of the ﬁve Nations. We now see you as it were in tears. from the various accidents daily occurring in this life which takes off from us. people of every descrip- tion indiscriminately. We therefore wipe your Face from tears that you may see clearly, we also clear away stoppages in your throat that you may speak without interruption and clear out your ears that you may hear distinctly what is said. Brothers, Listen now to the purport of our meeting. \Vhen our Forefathers had settled various things respecting our future interests they marked out their different Boundaries shewing the portion of Land belonging to each Nation where the “'arriors might freely ramble and seek their living. As I was enquiring after .this. which I had looked on I was told by the New York people that we had no right to that Land. but that the right belonged to the Five Nations. and that they had made it over to them.
Page 645
INDIAN SPEECHES AT CAUGHNAVVAGA 645 Brothers, I do not say you did so but this is what the New York people told us; it is for this reason we have called you Brothers of the Five Nations to our Council Fire, which we have now kindled for our brethren, and we hope the Almighty will assist us so as to set all right again, so let us cooly and deliberately examine the affair. that we may trace out what gave rise to it. The New York people might have said what they did heedlessly or with an intent to set as at variance, we trust however that the Almighty will assist us in the unravelling of this business. We think it expedient to lay the matter before our Father. but you Brother Sir John Johnson who is the head in the direction of indian affairs and from his knowledge of past transactions & the writings concerning these things which he may have seen. we think he must certainly know if any fraud has been made use of in the business, and be able to assist greatly in bringing the whole to a clear explanation. When the Boundaries of the different Nations Lands were agreed on by our Ancestors they forbid any cncroachments to be made on each other. we adhere to this strictly, you brothers of Oneida, our lands are adjoining to each other, we would never wish to lay hold of any of yours or in any way interfere with it. Should we ﬁnd our- selves deprived of the Land we looked on as ours we shall be without father or brother neither shall we have any comfort left us. Brother, I have spoken this only by word, the Wampum came to your hand long ago enquiring concerning this business. A Chief of the Caughnawagas then answered on the part of the Five Nations. Brothers, After we have considered what you have said we will answer you particularly on this subject. The Caughnawagas then closed the Council. Caronxawma 9h July A Chief of the Cayugas then spoke on behalf of the Five Nations. Brothers of the Seven Nations According to what you did yesterday we now wipe away the tears from your eyes that you may see clear & take away any obstructions from your throats that you may speak without interruption, and clear your ears that you may hear distinctly.
Page 646
646 INDIAN AFFAIRS Brothers As you said yesterday our Antcstors ordered that Story telling Birds should be cast behind our backs and not be listened to and that we shall do accordingly. be assured it is our wish to do so and to cast all such things behind our backs as they might tend to disturb our peace, besides that we may the better insure their not disturbing us again. according to the customs of our ancestors on such occasions we pull up a Pine and sink them under the ground there. that they may never any more come to light again. Then Capt. Brant spoke on behalf of the Five Nations as follows Brothers, Touching what you said yesterday that the New York People had told you that you had no right to the land you looked on as yours but that the Five Nations had made it over to them, this was the cause of your calling us to this Council Fire—Brothers the reason that we deferred so long coming was that we did not understand the business & thought that some of the Five Nations might have done so privately without our knowledge and therefore we wished previously to search into the affair that we might fully understand it and then to attend our Brothers Council Fire. Brothers Now that we have found out so much of the business as makes us perfectly easy with respect to ourselves. we have come to your Council Fire in the number you now see. which tho’ you may think great is no more than we thought necessary to attend that they might be wit- nesses to what we should say which we assure you to be the truth in the presence of the Almighty, as also according to the. customs of our ancestors, by the import of this Belt of Wampum which we present and before Sir John Johnson we say Brothers that we know nothing of what the New York People told you cencerniug your Lands or of ever as the Five Nations having interferred in the least with them, and we assure you Brothers, that this is the Truth—What I have now said is brief that the many young people present may the easier under- stand it and remember it. The (‘auglmawaga Speaker then expressed the satisfaction they re- ceived from what the Five Nations had said. and closed the Council.
Page 647
INDIAN SPEECHES AT CAUGHNAWAGA 647 CAUGHNAWAGA 10th July The Caughnawaga Speaker then arose and spoke as follows. Brothers, The Almighty has been pleased to preserve us and bring us safe together again, and we return him our sincere thanks, as also that he has been pleased to preserve our father in good health, who conducts our affairs and watches over our interests. Brothers, Now as to what you said yesterday that you pulled up a Pine and sunk under ground the Bird that tells Stories, we return you thanks. and we Join with you to put it under the ground from where the pine was taken up, to fall into a swift stream under it, which will take it to the big Sea from whence it never can return. Brothers, “’e have now done the burying under the ground the things that disturbed our peace, we now speak of what we think we had best do in the business for which we have met, which we again do lay before our Father Sir John Johnson, to assist us in rectifying the matter; but it appears to us necessary that we should both look towards the State of New York from whence the misunderstanding arose and both of us meet there to get it rectiﬁed by them that occasioned the mis- understanding, for should we go there alone they will perhaps only triﬂe with us; but Brothers if the length of the Journey should appear too troublesome we will if you please do it by writing with the assist- ance of our Father, whose knowledge of past transactions, and inﬂuence will enable us the better to get a satisfactory than if alone, if this should not succeed to get us a ﬁnal answer. we will then go there our- selves and meet and get the business settled. Captain Brant then spoke as follows on the part of the Five Nations. Brothers, Excuse us that we now deviate a little from the custom of our Ancestors (which was that however triﬂing the alfair spoken on should be. they would yet retire before they would give an answer from the respect with which they treated things of public concern) as we wish to expediate the business and our minds are made up in what we are to do in it, we answer you immediately. Brothers, - We approve of what you here propose and we will apply Jointly to Sir John Johnson for his assistance in writing to the New York State. as that was one of the reasons which caused us to come here. conﬁdent that his inﬂuence and knowledge he may have of writings concerning
Page 648
648 INDIAN AFFAIRS the affair to be rectiﬁed will be of great service to us in obtaining a satisfactory answer from the New York Government. but should he not from any reasons think it ﬁt to Join us in writing. we will go there ourselves and meet you there and bring it to a conclusion. He then exhorted the Young men to pay attention to what had passed, that they saw by it what things may make a great report which upon investigation would be found to be nothing. and how their Transactions with the White People. unless they were careful in them would bewilder them. and cause them immense trouble of which this was now an Example. The Caughnawagas expressed the satisfaction they received from what was said by the Five Nations and the Council then broke up.

[C 252. p 146] INDIAN SPEECH TO SIR JOHN JOHNSON AT LACHINE At a Meeting of the Chiefs of the Five Nations, in presence of Sir John Johnson Bart at Lachine the 12th July 1799. The Caughnawaga speaker addressed Sir John as follows Father & Brother, As we now speak in conjunction with our Brothers the Five Nations we are happy to see the Almighty has been pleased to preserve you. that we now see you well in council with us, we salute you kindly, as also our mother Lady Johnson, and our brothers your children, we thank the Almighty he has been pleased to protect you from accidents so that we now have the pleasure of seeing you well. Father & Brother, We now speak to you with one voice to inform you how we have settled the business we have been councilling about, which has been a long time in coming to a point. as our brethren wished ﬁrst to seek into the alfair before they would attend the council, we called them to. They now having gained sufﬁcient information of it, have come to our Council Fire, and what has passed between us has been to our mutual satisfaction, but as what the New York people have said has only appeared to be intended to cause confusion and misunderstanding among us who have to be brothers & kindred, we now apply to you father & Brother, jointly with our Brothers the Five Nations to assist us in bringing it to a good understanding, it being for that reason we have met here, knowing the knowledge you have of past Transactions may be of great assistance. and we conﬁde in your inﬂuence to obtain a direct answer from the State of New York; as hitherto they have only answered us evasively, but if this should not meet your approba- tion. or succeed. we have further agreed to go and meet there ourselves. and bring it to a conclusion. Brother 8: Father, “’e now speak again with one voice and one mind with our Brothers the Five Nations, concerning our deliberations in the meeting we have had; Formerly all Indians looked up to you as the one Head of their affairs. the different agents that are appointed at the Posts. was for the continual business to be transacted there, but we all looked up to you as the only Head of Indian Affairs, which was very agreeable to us,
Page 651
CAPT. M’KEE TO CAPT. M’LEAN 651 particularly as it promoted our unity and made the different Indian Nations more connected together, whereas the new arrangement of another to be at the Head of Indian Affairs for the Upper Province tends to disunite and divide the Nations, Besides we cannot bring our Ideas to see the propriety of having two Heads to our Affairs any more than there should be two Kings—again the preserving of our ancient customs was formerly promised us by the King and we were even exhorted to keep them & to be in unity with the different nations we now perceive considerable changes imperceptibly creeping in, that makes us apprehensive of being deprived by degrees of the liberty we have left, we therefore lay it before you, hoping you will assist us in representing it to the King. in whose goodness we conﬁde, as we judge that the changes have not originated from him. but rather from misrepresentations made from this side of the water. “’e cannot see that the preserving of our ancient customs can be in any way detrimental to government, from the long time they were allowed to continue without interruption. Capt. Brant then spoke as follows. \V'e hope you will excuse the great trouble we have put you to by such a great number of people being assembled here as there now is, the number may appear to you more than might be necessary according to your Ideas of transacting business but according to our customs a lesser number from the different Nations concerned could not well be dispensed with and we return you our most hearty thanks for the kind assistance you have been pleased to give us since we have been here in provisions and other things.

Sin, The Bonner a Shawnanoe Chief Just now from the Big Rock. came to me about an hour ago, while at dinner 8; informed me that a large body of Chickasaws were seen by two other principal Chiefs of that Nation on this side the Ohio on their way against all the Indian Nations indiscriminately who had been concerned in the attack of Fort Recovery five years ago where one of their principal Chiefs & several of their young men had been killed. The English are not excepted. That the Shawnanoes at the Fallen Timber had immediately on being informed of the intentions of the (.‘liickasaws. began to fortify them-

652 INDIAN AFFAIRS selves 8: sent messages in different directions to their Nations to demand their assistance. ' That two days ago all the Ottawas from Pointe aux Chene 8: the Rapids of the Miami River had immediately on receiving the Message sett off to Join them. That the Americans had told the Shawnanoes that they would endeavour to detain the Chickesaws if possible until] the Indian Nations in this Quarter could assemble to meet them. that if' they were determined to advance they would use force to prevent them. That the two Shawnanoe Chiefs who first discovered the Chickesaws narrowly escaped with their lives being carried off and saved by the Americans 8: consequently had no time to observe their strength but that their numbers appeared to be very considerable. \ I have not the least reason to doubt the truth of the report but from my knowledge of the (.‘hickesaw Nation I do not think that, unless they are joined by some of the other Southern tribes. they can bring forward many more than 500 ﬁghting men; therefore if they act alone I conceive no danger of their penetrating so far as this place.

Brother, We now think proper to speak a few words to you and to express our satisfaction at the treatment our Head Chief (Capt Brant) met with from the governor at Quebec. as also for the kind attention he was pleased to show to us the Five Nations. As he is now going to cross the water we expect he will so much favor us as to acquaint the King with our situation. we the Five Nations living on the Grand river. What we desire is nothing new, it is no more than to be as we formerly were before the war, when living in our own Country the indisputable proprietors of our Land, and not to have our title to them in any way disputable. We cannot see that our enjoying this privi- ledge could in any wise be detrimental to government. the disputing with us a thing of such small moment to it, and of such consequence to us, and that would give us such general satisfaction, rather surprises us. Brother. We have now said this is as it were on the way of our taking our farewell. we will yet speak a. few words concerning our sentiments on the subject of our meeting—Previous to our meeting we looked on it as a thing without foundation and that it would turn out to nothing,

Brother, We have now further to return you our hearty thanks. from the whole Five Nations for the kind & generous treatment you have shown us, all the ﬁve Nations from our abode to Oneida have been here and you have been equally kind to all, without giving any the least cause to complain of partiality. which is different with the United States. who only pay attention to those living lmrticularly within their Boundaries but your kind treatment to all gives us heartfelt satisfac- tion for which we return you our Sincere Thanks.

I expect the transport will still be suﬂ‘iciently forward and that there will be no necessity for freighting any Merchant Vessels, particularly as the Ottawas is in such forwardness as will enable her to make at least two trips this season if necessary and this I have no doubt will be sufﬁcient to bring up all the stores required, I am certain more than we have store room for. One more trip of the Francis will be fully adequate to convey to St Joseph every article that may be wanted for that garrison until] next Spring.

656 ' INDIAN AFFAIRS The whole of the Picketing round this Garrison is compleated. one of the Bastions is nearly so, and I hope another Bastion will be far advanced if not compleated before the winter. The greatest part of the Timber contracted for last year for a twelve months’ stock, as well as that contracted for in the Spring has been delivered. We are all in a state of perfect tranquility here and the Indians are quiet and well satisfy’d, whatever interested persons may incline to advance to the contrary. Indeed I never knew the Indians here other- wise and if left to themselves and if encouraged to provide for their Familys by Hunting, instead of depending so much on the Bounty of government they would do much better. Untill of late it has never been customary to give them more pro- visions than merely to satisfy their wants and supply their necessities. I inclose a copy of Indian information received some days ago from Capt. McKee tho’ like all information from the same source has turned out just as I expected. I send merely to shew His Excellency the Artiﬁce of these people when they have a favourite object in view. I have no doubt but Capt. McKee has been imposd upon as he indeed acknowledges himself. the Bonner alias Keckanathucko who gave him this information is a Shawanese Chief who lives with Mr. Elliott and is entirely under his inﬂuence, from which it may be easily con- jectured how the reports are generated and the motives which gave rise to it. 1 shall however endeavour to trace it to its source tho’ I appre- hend it will be difﬁcult to ﬁx it upon the real author. It has been with such reports they have all along deceived Mr. President Russel. A Mr. Hyde an American oﬂicer is just arrived from the Mississippi where he says everything is perfectly quiet, he came through the Indian Village of the Chickasaws and remained with them a night. be men- tions that he was well received among them, that they are quite in a state of civilization 8: have their ﬂocks of Cattle and their cultivated ﬁelds to which they pay great attention and that not one of that nation has been from home this year excepting a Chief that traveled about 280 miles with this ofﬁcer himself. I have this moment received information that Mr. Elliott the late Supt. is just to set off for Lower Canada. it is said on his way to England tho’ I can hardly credit it. It is said that he is to be accompanied by the Bonner (above mentioned) who gave the false information and another Shawanese Chief named Berry. who are both in his interest. but men of no consequence or note. He is likewise to be accompanied by one Fisher an Interpreter, the same identical person who acted in
Page 657
CAPT. M'KEE TO CAPT. CLAUS 657 that capacity as well as issuer of Provisions at the Village of Chenail Ecarte when the false return of Indians was presented to me by Mr. Elliott and a requisition for provisions made corresponding with that false return. I have in a former letter observed that this same Fisher (who was an Indian Prisoner and in fact has no Religion) was perse- cuted by Mr. Selby to make oath before a magistrate that the number of Indians at the said Village during his residence there was still greater than Mr. Elliott's return. I have likewise observed that being himself interested as issuer of provisions to these Indians his oath merited no attention and ought never to have been received. That he must be highly criminated by the true return and that nothing can possibly justify him but to make the numbers correspond at least with the amount of the issues. These are circumstances worthy of attention and must tend still more to condemn these persons who wish to make use of such a man’s oath to justify their vile proceedings, instead of exrulpating them. In order to show His Excellency my own Ideas of the Indian report above alluded to I inclose a copy of my letter to Capt McKee on that subject. in answer to his Report. 1 have the honor to be Sir Your most obt. m0st humble Servt Major Green HECTOR Me LEAN My.

This they readily complied with. and their share of the goods was delivered accordingly: of course there is now no kind of diﬁiculty in ﬁnishing the business as soon as you can come up. or send me an authority for that purpose. I would by no means have taken this step without orders had I not been well assured of the necessity and propriety of permanently ﬁnishing the business with the \Vyandotts, who heretofore made a considerable diﬁiculty in it. You will please also to pardon my having proposed to this nation without your permission to give to the Crown sixty feet of Road through their reserve between Amherstburg and Sandwich. without which these Town- ships were not connected, nor could the Commissioner of High “'ays or overseers compel statute labor so that the road might be made safe & commodious. . The Wyandotts immediately agreed to give it. and I submit to you the propriety of obtaining an authority to accept the same. and of inserting the description thereof in the Sandwich Deed.

So much has been already said in my Letters relative to Indians and the misrepresentations sent from this Quarter respecting them. that little remains to be said on that Head at present and I have no doubt but the Commander in Chief is by this time perfectly convinced that no real grievance existed among these people. at least no such thing has been known here. and Capt. McKee told me himself in presence of several officers of the Garrison. since the receipt of Mr. Russell's

I have only further to observe as every unprejudiced person here & even Capt. Me Kee himself must allow. that the Indians have never behaved better nor more orderly than this Summer. and they are now constantly coming in numbers to receive their annual presents. when they likewise receive a suﬂicieney in provisions and innncd-iately depart, perfectly satisfy’d without the smallest appearance of discontent, which indeed I have made it my particular business to enquire of Interpreters and others. and the result has been much to my satisfaction, indeed were it otherwise Capt Me Kee should have immediately made it known to me. when it is not probable that I should have been so rash 8: inconsistent as to have persisted in a plan, in its tendency so manifestly injurious to His Majesty’s Interest in this Country as was pretended. But Capt. Me Kee knows perfectly that there was no real cause of complaint if not under the Inﬂuence and Council of other designing persons, he is very capable of managing the Indians, and seems to have the King‘s Interest much at Heart. The Commander in Chief may rest assured that I shall implicitly observe the directions I have received & that the Indians shall have whatever the Superintendent asks for them. ' I inelose for the Commander in Chiefs information a Report of Survey on Ordnance Stores, a Report of Survey on damaged provisions 8: a certiﬁcate of their being destroyed, on account of the reasons assigned in the report, as well as to make room for other Stores. The Sloop Francis returns immediately to Fort Erie & I hope will be here again to proceed in time to St Joseph with private Stores for the ofﬁcers of that Post there being nothing else wanted there.

I have laid before the King Mr. President Russell's1 Letters from 58 to 69 both inclusive. and ‘I shall now proceed to acquaint you with the. sentiments of His Majesty‘s }overnment on such of them as appear to make such a communication necessary. With respect to No. 58 and 62 on the subject of Indian Affairs—1t will be sufﬁcient for me to refer you to His Majesty’s Additional Instructions of the 15h December 1796 to show you that it was incum- bent upon Mr. Russell to take upon himself (as it is now incumbent upon you to take upon yourself) the conduct and management of the Indian Department as far as it relates to Upper Canada and to give such directions to all Persons concerned in that Ik-‘partment as you shall judge necessary. subject only to such special orders as shall be directed to you from the Governor General of His Majesty's North American Provinces for the time being. But as the Governor Gene'al has been recalled and as I see no probability of his resuming that ofﬁce you will consider that the whole responsibility for the due lSee appendlx.

664 INDIAN AFFAIRS arrangement of the Indian Affairs within the Province of Upper Canada devolves upon you. With respect therefore to the oﬁices at present vacant in the Indian Department in Upper Canada. (in which I include that held by the late Colonel McKee‘ which is now exer- cised and interim by Mr. Claus) or such of those ofﬁces as you judge it necessary to fill up, you are in conformity to the above Instructions to transmit to me by the ﬁrst opportunity the Names of such Persons as on account of their Characters and Services, you shall judge to be best qualiﬁed for that purpose. in order that His Majesty’s pleasure may be signiﬁed to you respecting them. In the event of Mr. Claus’s succeeding Colonel McKee (concerning which I shall not move His Majesty untill I receive an answer from you to this letter) Mr. Presi- dent Russell recommends three Persons to succeed to the appointment for Indian Affairs in the Niagara. District.v but does not specify which of them' he thinks the ﬁttest for the situation. 7 In regard to Monsieur De I‘uisaye2 and the Loyalists mentioned in No. 59, I have only to refer you to that part of my letter of the 11h June last, which relates to that subject. The amount of Articles of Commerce inclosed in No. 60 which pay duty at Quebec and have passed into I'pper Canada in the years 1797 and 1798 clearly shew the growing importance of that Province, a con- sideration. which. tho’ highly satisfactory in many respects, cannot but add very materially to the concern I feel at the want of ofﬁciating Clergy, and the extreme diﬁiculty which is found in inducing Ministers of the Church of England to settle in Canada, notwithstanding the encouragement held out to them by His Majesty. The Rey"1 Mr. Red- dish will have returned to the Province long before this letter reaches you and I have to acquaint you that I have made the strongest repre- sentations to the Society for the Propogation of the Gospel, and the most anxious enquiries in every other quarter for the purpose of obtaining Clergymen of the Established Church.2 who are properly qualiﬁed. who may take upon them the charge of the Parishes in both the (‘anadas. You will observe in the Estimate for Upper Canada for the present year a copy of which I inclose that there is a tem- porary provision of £400 per' annum for four Clergymen. This allow- ance is of course intended to be continued untill such time as the Church or Crown Reserves shall be sufficiently productive to render the continuance of it no longer necessary. But as it is not to be expected this temporary Provision can be extended in proportion to the number of Clergymen. which the increasing Settlement of the Province will require; it will be highly necessary that the Province itself should

Page 665
DUKE OF PORTLAND TO LIEUT. GEN. HUNTER 665 determine upon and settle without delay some mode of providing a suitable temporary Provision for them out of its own Resources. which Provision would cease of course. as soon as the Church or Crown Reserves afford a sufﬁcient fund for that purpose. But as this is a subject upon which I have had occasion to write very much at large to your Predecessors, I shall content myself with referring you to such of my dispatches as relate to it. I learn with great Pleasure the means which are stated in No. 64 to have been taken for making Roads to facilitate the communication between such parts of the Province as are already settled—it is the ﬁrst and most necessary of all steps towards promoting the cultivation and commerce and general civilization of the colony. \Vhatever credit is to be given to Brandt for his Loyalty and attach- ment to this country (upon which I am not inclined to place any great reliance) it is unquestionably evident that he omits no oppor~ tunity of consolidating the Indian Interest with a view to form an Indian Confederacy, and to place himself at the head of it—-than which nothing can be more directly contrary to our Interests and to the Line of conduct which His Majesty’s Governors in Canada have been directed to pursue in keeping those Interests and concerns as separate and disunited as possible. Brandt’s idea that the annual presents made to the Indians are to be considered merely as a reward for their past conduct, ought.to be discountenanced in every manner possible. and it cannot be too strongly inculcated and too strongly impressed on the minds of the Indians. that a continuance of the King’s Bounty to them entirely and absolutely depends on their using their best endeavours to promote as far as in them lies. the King‘s Interests. and the views of His Government within the Province. The act entitled "an act for the better ascertaining the appropriation of Lands to be allotted to the use of the Protestant Clergy is so incon- sistent with the Instruction contained in the Postcript of my letter to Mr. President Russell No. 6. of the 4th November 1797 that I desire you to refer to it to satisfy yourself of the impropriety of the act.— You will ﬁnd it stated by me that the act should be strictly conﬁned to Grants. which have been made since the passing of the Canada act without the appropriations required as a conditional part of them, having been made at the same time. But in addition to that. the act provides for what the Executive authority is of itself competent to pro- vide by virtue of the Canada Act. namely for tlpljl'ﬂlﬂ‘iilflﬁllﬂ to be made for Lands granted prcrious to the passing of that act. In this respect therefore the act in question would be irregular and unneces-
Page 666
666 INDIAN AFFAIRS sary. But what renders it more particularly objectionable is, that it contains the words “or hereafter to be granted” and is made to refer to future grants. which is a Provision in direct contradiction to my several letters on this subject, to the dates and numbers of which I refer you in the margin. [No. 10, 6 Jan. 1796. No. 14. 22 Apl. do. No. 6, 4 Nov. 1797.] Under these circumstances therefore at which I am not to be greatly surprized it is impossible for me consistently with the duty of my situation to recommend it to His Majesty to assent to the Act in question. But that you may be the more fully apprized of the very extraordinary and unaccountable mistakes, which have taken place on this particular point, I must refer you to the 36h clause of the Canada Act, by which you will see that in regard to grants made previous to the passing of that Act. you are as the King’s Representative; already authorized to make appropriations or allotments in respect to such grants, without any further Act being passed for that purpose and that in doing so, you have only to fulﬁll t0 the best of your judgment the Provisions of the Clause of the Canada Act above referred to, that is, by making the allotments and appropriations so that they may be as nearly in the proportion of one to seven of the same value as the Grants, in consideration of which they are to be made. were, at the time of the making such grants—This being the case the only object of the Pro- posed Bill is to provide for the grants made between the passing of the Canada Act and the time of the passing such Bill in consideration of which no allotments or appropriations shall have been made or required by the above mentioned clause of the Canada Act. With this view nothing more appears to me to be necessary than a very short Colonial Act in the terms of the Draft I now inclose or to that effect, upon which you will of course consult His Majesty’s Law. Servants in the Province—with respect to all future grants and the allotments and appropriations which make a necessary part of them, they are of course to be made according to the approved Diagram mentioned in my letter to Maj. General Simcoe of the Uh January 1796, and I desire that you will inform me by the ﬁrst opportunity whether, subsequent to the time when it was notiﬁed from hence to the government of Upper Canada that the said Diagram was approved of, and was to be adopted. any vacant Crown Lands have been disposed of in the Province contrary to the Plan of intermixing the Lots granted with Church and Crown appropriations. as dessignated by that Diagram-— Because I cannot but suspect unless that Diagram was strictly com-

It was on con- sideration of the removal of Captain McKee from the Post of St. Josephs. to take upon himself the agency at Amherstburg. on the dis- missal of Mr. Elliott from that oﬁice. and the death of Capt Lamothe that I was induced to submit to the General, the propriety of reccom- mending to His Majesty's Ministers the appointment of a gentleman, in every respect well qualiﬁed to ﬁll that Station, and in the hopes that the General would order him to act in that capacity till His Majesty’s pleasure might be known. which I am sorry to say cannot be done. as I am fearful he will not give up his present prospects to act in an Inferior Station than that of the Agent or President. The other arrangement with respect to an increase of salary to the two agents above. which was once ordered, but countermanded on a representation of mine, in favour of another. who was left out. was merely submitted to the general‘s consideration as a matter to be carried into effect or not hereafter.

Sugar separate. altho they came to Council together 8: each village headed by its own Chietfs. I cannot comprehend what they mean by saying they never receive presents at this Post. but rather buys what they get, I can assure you with conﬁdence. for His Excel- lency the Commander in Chief's information that the Ottawas receive much larger presents in proportion to their numbers than any other Indians, in some respects they deserve it. as they present more sugar & corn for the use of government than any other Indians. If any fraud was committed when Capt Lamothe was dividing the presents, it lL'm'be Croche, Arhe Croche.

CAPT. GRANT TO MAJOR GREEN 669 never came to my knowledge nor they never complained of him to me.

I place no belief in the report, but if the circumstance had taken place I have great reason to think I would have been acquainted there with as early as any person whatever. Not having any authority to pay those I might employ to collect intelligence in the Indian Country 8; no fund of Government entrusted with me for that purpose. I will not employ any person, altho’ I will collect my information from those Indians who can be depended on.‘ I meant to have said in the ﬁrst part of my Letter that if the Canadian mentioned by Capt.

The Six Nations were of Algonquin stock of the Iroquoian confederacy formerly called the Five Nations of Cayuga, Mohawk, Oneida, Onondaga and Seneca, the sixth being the admission of the Tuscarora. The Mingoes were a part of the Iroquois tribes who formed a settlement on the Ohio, near the Shawnees and Delawares. In 1766 their settlement. known as Mingo town, contained about 60 families and was the only Indian village on the Ohio between Pittsburg and Louisville. In their ﬁrst relation to the government they were called Senecas. In 1800 they were joined by the Cayugas and made a settlement at Lewistown, and were known as the mixed Senecas to distinguish them from the Senecas of the Sandusky. In 1831 they sold their lands, journeyed to Kansas which they left in 1867 to live in the Indian Territory where. the two bands united under the name of Shawnee. In 1905 they only numbered 366.

It was located between Sixth and Eighth streets, north of Main in the present city of Louisville. See Conquest of the Northwest—- Life of G. K. Clark by English, Vol. II, pp. 754-6. Major George Walls was put in command of the remains of the Illinois Regiment at Fort Nelson in August 1782. He disbanded his troops on the 15th of Feb. 1784, after the ratiﬁcation of Peace. See Virginia State Papers, Vol. III. This was John Bull, a Moravian Missionary accompanied by Wiegand, also a Moravian. They reached Oswego early in June and Fort Niagara June 16th.

They are of the Algonquin stock closely related to the Sacs and Foxes. Their origin is uncertain, the ﬁrst traces coming from Wisconsin. They conspired with the Fox plot to burn Detroit in 1712. They moved to Illinois about 1765, where they separated, those going west were known as the Prairie tribe, the eastern as the Vermilion band. They aided Tecumseh and Black Hawk. In 1809 they ceded their lands to U. S. and moved south landing in Mexico, where they were called Mexican Kickapoos. They were un‘ comfortable neighbors and were persuaded to remove to the Indian Terri- tory. They lived in bark houses in the summer and ﬂag-reed oval lodges during the winter. They used more horses than other tribes and went as far as Texas on their horse stealing raids. They were good tillers of the soil and also hunters. Their mythology is very rich. From a population of 3,000 in 1759 they have dwindled to 432 in the U. S. in 1905. Efforts have been made to banish them all to Mexico but have not been successful. Their known villages were Etnataek on the Sangamon river. IlI., Kickapougowi on the Wabash in Crawford Co., 111., and Necouga in Miami 00., Ind. Handbook of American Indians, Part 1, p. 684. 134. Ouiat or Ouittanongs refers to the Weas this word being a contraction of Wawiaqtenang “place of the round or curved channel." They were a sub-tribe of the Miamis and associated with the Kickapous who_ lived in the present state of Indiana. Wawaqtenang otherwise “Eddy people" was the common Algonquian name for Detroit. Ouiatenon was one of the principal headquarters of the French traders. In 1791 their villages were destroyed by Gen. Scott. They participated in the Greenville treaty. In 1832 they sold their lands and removed to Kansas. They were joined by the remainders of seven tribes, and 'in 1886 moved to Oklahoma where a few still remain. Handbook of American Indians.

The Potawatomies ap- plied the term Mashkotens to the tribe known as Prairie Band living in Illinois. They are closely connected with the Kickapoas. They confed erated with the Assegun or Bone Indians and to them are attributed the “garden beds." Champlain ﬁrst mentions them in 1616. Their chief village was between the Fox and Wisconsin rivers. They formed a settle- ment on the Ohio at the mouth of the Wabash, probably at Old Fort Massac. They were driven west, the last mention by Dodge in 1779, where he refers to them on the Wabash with the Piankashaws and Ver- millions or Kickapous. They were probably absorbed by the Sacs and Foxes. They were treacherous, warlike and worshipers of the sun and thunder. They propitiated their gods by gifts of tobacco. Handbook of American Indians, Part 1, p. 810. 134. Piankashaw meaning “those who separate," a. sub-tribe of the Miamis, which became a separate people being driven west by the Iroquois. They aﬂili- ated with the Weas, and removed to Kansas going from there to Oklahoma in 1867. They participated in several treaties. The tribe at best never numbered more than a thousand and in 1906 consisted of less than 200 who were consolidated under the name of Peorias. Handbook of American Indians, p. 240. 134. The Peyawris, commonly called Peorias meaning “he comes carrying a pack on his back” were one of the principal tribes of the ﬁve Illinois tribes. They were located in different places the principal one being near Peoria, III. In 1768 the Kickapous took possession of this village the

Harrison could ﬁnd only four men of the tribe living. Handbook of American Indians. part 2, p. 228. Jacob Schiefi’elin was born in Philadelphia in 1757. He was secretary on Hamilton's staff at Detroit. In 1783 he went with other Loyalists to Canada where he became engaged in business as a merchant at. Montreal. In 1794 he bought out the drug business of his brother-in-law in New York and took another brother-in-law, John B. Lawrence into partners ship. See One hundred years of Business Life 1799-1894, W. H.

He was promoted to ﬁrst lieutenant Jan. lst, 1777, and captain in October 1777, retiring Jan. 17, 1781. After his visit to Detroit he returned to Pennsylvania and married Ann Irish. daughter of Nathaniel Irish, a captain in the artiﬁcers, Sept. 30th 1783. She was born Dec. 29, 1760 and survived him. He was commissioned brevet major, Oct. 10, 1783. He entered service under Wayne and was hospital storekeeper at Hobson's Choice, Aug. 3, 1793. which ofﬁce he held until his death Nov. 29, 1793.

He came to America in the winter of 1777-8 and entered the Continental Army as a volunteer. He began at once to organize and discipline the troops and steadily rose to the rank of major~ general. At the close of the war he was sent to Canada to demand the surrender of the posts on the frontier in which he was unsuccessful. He now retired to private life. iiving part of the time in New York City and the rest on his farm near Utica, N. Y. After the war Congress voted him a pension of $2.400 for his services in the war.

Sir: In pursuance of your appointment as messenger to the sevrl Indian Na- tions on the Frontiers of the United States, you will, in the execution of your mission, conform to the instructions laid down in the resolve of Congress which accompanies this letter. You will announce to the difft Tribes the Proclamation of Congress and the Articles of Peace, and you will verbally inform the Indians that the British King has been compelled to agree to make peace with the United States. That he has ﬁxed the Boundaries between his People and the People of the United States,—That he has agreed to evacuate and deliver up to the United States the Forts O-N-D. and all other Forts occupied by him to the Southward of the line agreed upon between his people and the people of the United States.

S. regret that the Indians did not pay due attention to the advice which was given to them at Albany in the beginning of the late quarrel, as if they had listened to that advice they might have lived in Peace during the War, and would at this time have been exempt from all its ill consequences. In making this intimation you will point out to the Indians the great losses which they have suffered, and the calamaties which they have brought upon themselves by their espousal of the cause of G. B.—You will then inform them 'that the U. S. are a compassionate and merciful people—that they are disposed to pity the I and to forgive their past folly, on condition that they im- mediately desist from further hostility, and hereafter conduct themselves as a people disposed to enjoy the blessings of Peace which are now exv tended to them: But if they hesitate to accept the friendship which is now offered to them, or continue hostilities, they must expect that the U. who have now no other object to employ the Valour of their Warriors, will take the most severe and exemplary vengeance of the In- dians—That however they hope there will be no occasion to use threats or proceed to extremties—That the l-— must see it is their Interest, and essential to their happiness to live in peace with the U. S. and as the 'U— S are disposed to enter into friendly treaty with them they should immediately put a stop to all hostilities, call in their Warriors, assemble their Council of Wise men, and appoint some of them to meet the Com- missrs of the U. S.—at a place to be agreed upon, there to agree upon a treaty of Peace and friendship. As the business of your mission will be facilitated by taking with you the Emblems of Peace, you will endeavor to procure all such as may be required in your interviews. You will, in the most effectual manner, and with all possible dispatch, endeavor to effect the completion of this business, in which you will employ such assistance as shall be found indispensably requisite—the strictest Economy govern- ing all your expences. You will extend your information to D—. which place you will visit as soon as your necessary communications on the road will admit In en- close to you a letter for Commd. Oﬂir. of that Post. Mr. Bull is charged with a similar commission to the Indians at Oswego & Niagara, but in case of accident to him, you will, if you should ﬁnd it necessary, make the like communications to those Tribes; in which case, I think you had better return by Albany from which place, should circumstances make it necessary, you will draw upon me for your Addi- tional expenses.

They have three clans, the Bear, Wolf and Turtle. They are represented by nine chiefs in councils. They became possessed of ﬁre arms through the Dutch, and by these means they conquered the Munsees and Dela- wares.

On August 17, 1783, Irvine wrote Benjamin Lincoln that a great number of men had crossed the Ohio and had actually made settlements in differ- ent places from the Muskingum to the Wabash. He was apprehensive that this fact would probably renew the Indian war. Irvine’s letter was laid before Congress and referred to a committee with the result that Congress issued a proclamation prohibiting and forbidding “all persons from making settlements on lands inhabited or claimed by Indians with- out the limits or jurisdiction of any particular state." This proclamation received no attention on the part of the settlers who persisted in en croaching on the Indian lands. Congress then undertook to drive them off and on Jan. 24, 1785, Lieut-Col. Josiah Harmar was instructed to use what force he thought necessary to drive the people off.

Dr. William Harffy, hospital mate, in 1781 prayed for appointment as sur- geon of the 53d Regiment to succeed the late Dr. Curry. He was how- ever sent to Detroit in April of that year to relieve Mr. Menzies, surgeon of the 84th Regiment. He served in this capacity until 1786, when he succeeded Dr. George Christian Anthon at Detroit. At the close of the Revolution he remained a British subject and was garrison surgeon at Amherstburg. Canadian Archives. John Little or Lytle was born in Donegal, Lancaster Co., Pa., son of Na- thaniel and Janet Lytle. He left home about 1770, living at Path Valley near Carlisle, Pa.. and later moved near Plttsburg. He was openly Tory in his sympathies and very soon found it unpleasant to remain there. He left his family near Pittsburg and made his escape to Detroit in the early part of the war. When Peace was declared he obtained a pass and went to Pittsburg hoping to carry his family north with him. He was however imprisoned by Irvine (Vol. XI, p. 387 this series) and after thirty-ﬁve days made his escape, his family following him. He re- turned to Detroit and bought a farm on Lake St. Clair. In 1796 his name appears among those who elected to remain British subjects. He died intestate in 1817 and was buried at Grosse Pointe, Aug. 24, 1817, aged seventy years.

He served in the War of 1812 and was appointed assistant quarter- master-general with rank of captain, March 13, 1813, at Niagara. In May of that year he was made a prisoner by the Americans and was detained at Burlington, U. S. He was also at the Battle of Queenston Heights. His house was the only one in Niagara which was saved in the con- ﬁagration during of war. Mr. Clench was a member of Gov. Simcoe's ﬁrst Parliament in Upper Canada and was prominent in the development of the district. He married Elizabeth Johnson, a descendant of Sir Wil- liam Johnson, by whom he had several children, among them Joseph Clench who married at Niagara, Oct. 5, 1831, Eliza Whistler, daughter of Maj. Whistler, U. S.

This is probably John de Courcy Gill who was a hospital mate in July 1780, became a surgeon in the hospital at Carleton Island the same year serving there until 1783 with Kerr as hospital mate. In 1783 he petitioned to be allowed the surgeoncy at Cataraqui in the event of Peace. In the summer of 1783, small-pox broke out among the soldiers. Dr. Gill and a few other army physicians wished to try inoculation. As there was a difference of opinion as to its beneﬁts the experiment was stopped. Haldi- mand wrote that he feared for the fatal consequences should small-pox be introduced by this means among the Indians. He further expressed himself as being very much displeased that Gill should have the impu- pudence to carry to the upper country small-pox matter for inoculation and ordered him to stop its use. _Nov. 2, 1783, an order was issued that all matter for inoculation carried from Quebec should be put under guard.

He purchased this tract of land on the Grand River from the Mississagues to provide a home for the Indians of the Six Nations who wished to remain subject to the King of England. Owen Bowen had been a clerk living with C01. Guy Johnson for about three years and is recorded as having run in debt to Taylor and Forsyth, mer- chants at Fort Niagara. While at the Fort he married a white prisoner who had three children. He was unable to support them and memorial- ized Abraham Cuyler, Commissary for prisoners, for a prisoner's allow- ance of provisions and clothing. See Buﬂ’alo Hist. Coils. Vol. IX, p. 242-3. This is undoubtedly Lt.-Col. John Caldwell who was appointed in the 8th or King's Foot, Oct. 27, 1772. This regiment during the Revolution was stationed at Niagara. Here Caldwell presided at a Council of the Six Nations and the western tribes in September, 1776. He either retired or died shortly after the Council.

This was Colonel, later General William Hull of 1812 fame, who was com- missioned by Congress to repair to Quebec and make a formal demand of the Governor-General for the posts within the lines of the United States. Haldimand insisted that he had never received instructions to evacuate these posts and therefore could not give them up. Hull ob- tained no satisfaction and was forced to return and report his failure to Congress. These were supposed by Hoyes to have been invited to come to Genesee by Ebenezer Allan, a. sort of desperado, who near the close of the Revolu- tion made his ﬁrst appearance on the Genesee River.

Finding that the Indians were still determined to keep up the war which was a great hindrance to trade, he played a trick upon them which drew upon him the displeasure of both the British and Indians at Niagara. Just before an expedition was to start upon the war path he procured a belt of wampum and carried it as a peace token to the nearest American post. The Indians accepted the overtures of peace. When they discovered the ruse they were greatly incensed against Allen, as were the British and for months they pursued him. At times they allowed him to live in peace and then they would resume the pursuit until ﬁnally he was captured and sent up to Quebec for trial sometime in 1784. Nothing was proved against him and he was acquitted and returned to his trade in New York. Canad. Arch. B. 103, pp. 419, 423. He obtained a grant of land in New York from the Indians and sold it to Robert Morris, after which he took his two white wives. leaving his Indian wife behind in New York, and removed to the La Tranche (Thames) River, (Upper Canada.

In 1782 they formed a company under the title of the Northwest Company, which carried on business until 1798 when they disagreed and formed a second company. In 1799 the original company applied for a grant of land on the Sault Ste. Marie. in this they were opposed by the X. Y. Company which thought that the ground about the strait should always remain in the hands of the Crown. In 1802 the Northwest company applied for the sole use of the improve- ments on the north side of the Sault and stated that they had cut a road across the carrying place, had opened a canal with a lock and had built a sawmill. storehouse and other necessary buildings.

He spent much of his time in the Indian country about the lakes, made proposals to Vaudreuil for arrangements of the western posts just before the Battle of the Plains of Abraham. He visited Michilimackinac in 1773 to collect some debts. During the Revolution he commanded the Canadians and Indians in Burgoyne’s expedition. He was appointed to the Legislative Council (1778) and remained for some time in that body always defending the political rights of the Canadians. He died at an advanced age. Bibaud, Jr. gives his full name Luc De Chapt de Laoorne St. Luc (in an earlier edition, Luc Deschamps de La Corne St. Luc).

In the spring of 1777 he was appointed chief engineer of Burgoyne's Army and served through the campaign. He was taken prisoner but was shortly exchanged and returned to Ticonderoga where he served in the evacuation, Nov. 1777. In the autumn of 1778, he and Capt. Aubrey and Lieut.

His stepfather William Forsyth soon found the lad and they went west, settling in Detroit. At the age of eighteen, John became an Indian trader and established two trading posts, one at Sandusky and the other at Maume. The Indians gave him the name of Shaw-nee-aw-kee or Silver man, because of his trade. John Kinzie, Chicago‘s Pioneer by E. L. K. Gordon.

Corn Planter (Ga-nio-de-euh) was born about 1735, son of John O’Bail (Abeel, O’Beal) and a native of Conewaugus in the valley of the Genesee River. He fought against Braddock in 1755 but during the Revolution joined Brant and Red Jacket against the Americans. After peace was declared he became a ﬁrm friend of the United States and was very effective in bringing about the treaty of Fort Stanwix in 1784. He re- mained neutral during the Indian troubles leading up to the treaty of Greenville. He sent one of his sons to Philadelphia to be educated but was disappointed in the result, saying that "it entirely spoils Indiana." He died at his residence on the Alleghany River, March 7, 1836, being over one hundred at the time. See Stone’s Life of Red Jacket, pp. 423- 456.

Tuscaroras, “hemp gatherers," came originally from the South where they were cruelly treated and massacred by other tribes, their lands taken from them and they sold into slavery. This probably made them thirst for vengeance. They made a treaty with the people of Penn, and by their aid they joined the Five Nations who were afterwards called the Six Nations. In 1766 they journeyed to the Moravian mission where they were pronounced lazy and “refuse to hear religion." They were fright- ened by their ﬁrst sight of snow and took refuge with the missionaries. Their removal was to Canada. Handbook of American Indians. part 2, pp. 842-853. Maj.-Gen. Charles Scott was born in Cumberland Co., Va., in 1733 and died Oct. 22, 1813. He served under Braddock in 1755 and during the Revo- lution under Wayne. He was with Arthur St. Clair at the time of his defeat and fought in the Battle of Fallen Timbers in 1794. From 1808 to 1812 he was governor of Kentucky and a town and county in that state are named after him. Appleton's Cyclopedia of American Biography. This probably refers to Gen. Clarke who in 1793 unwisely accepted a com- mission as major-general from Genet, the French diplomatic agent at Washington, in an effort of the French to dislodge the Spanish on the Mississippi and issued a proclamation calling for volunteers. The timely interference of Washington resulting in the recall of Genet, put a stop to this intrigue. See Green's The Spanish Conspiracy and How George Rogers Clark won the Northwest by Thwaites.

On Aug. 11, 1794, Wayne sent out a scouting party consisting of Wells, McClellan, the Millers, May and Mahaffy. They rode into an Indian vil- lage opposite Fort Meigs where they were taken for Indians. After gain- ing what information they desired they turned back; On their return came upon another Indian band and were recognized. In making their escape May was captured. He had once been a prisoner among these Indians and when they recognized him they decided to reck their ‘ven- geance upon him. They kept him until Aug. 19th when they tied him to a tree and killed him. See Howe's Hist. Calls. 0] Ohio, Vol. II, p. 399.

He invited the Indians to a council to be held at the mouth of the Detroit River on Oct. 10th, known as the council at Brown's town. Vol. XXV, p. 40, this series. At that council he urged the Indians to retire peacefully to their homes for the winter and not to give up their Ohio lands to the Americans. See Life and Times of Gov. Simcoe by Read, pp. 228-231. Capt. Ebenezer Denny was stationed at Le Boeuf to keep the Six Nations from joining the Ohio Indians against Wayne. He kept a journal of his expedition which is printed in the Publication of the Hist. Soc. of Pennsylranim Vol. VII. This was Andrew Ellicott who surveyed and laid out the city of Washington and in 1792 was made Surveyor General of the United States. This is also called the "Whiskey Insurrection."

Iroquois, "real adders," was the general name given to the confederation of the Five Nations, Cayuga, Mohawk, Oneida, Onondaga and Seneca. Kinship was only acknowledged by the woman branch of the family. The chiefs were nominated by the suffrages of the women and conﬁrmed by the councils of chiefs. The Delawares gave them the name of Mingwe. It is thought they were confederated about 1570, occasioned by Huron and Algonquin wars. Their conquests were stopped by the Chippewas. but they were generally allies of the English. The Mohawks and Onon- dagas withdrew and formed Catholic settlements on the St. Lawrence. There were about 24 villages but they varied at times. The tribe’s great- est number was about 16,000, but in 1904 they are rated higher, includ- ing 3,000 mixed bloods.
